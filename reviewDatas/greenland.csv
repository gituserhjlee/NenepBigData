0,"Watched ""Greenland"". Doesn't add anything new to the catastrophic events genre, yet it was the perfect movie to watch amid the coronavirus pandemic. Sitting in a sparsely populated movie theater, wearing my facemask, I was thinking ""it could be so much worse!"""
1,"We went tonight, my girlfriend and I, as two people who likes this kind of movies and we loved it.English is not my native language so I will keep it short : this is a well made apocalypse movie that evolved from those made in the 90s and 00s. We can feel a contemporary vibe here and it is refreshing.What I liked : No downtime, lots of emotions and twists. Intense.What I didn't like : bad CGI at some points"
2,"Lot of end of the world movies follow the same storyline but this one had that little extra. Felt like the way they handled this was more realistic, so in a way 'scarier'. I usually like seeing a lot of the destruction and action itself but I definitely recommend watching it"
3,"Very hard to watch. The feeling that you have already seen it, but oh no, it is a new movie.
Family problems - check . What does it have to do with disaster. Why?
Annoying kid - check. World War Z
Annoying kid with health issue - check WWZ
Drugstore scene - check. WWZ
Shooting in drugstore - check. WWZ
And so on...
Oh, almost forgot.
View on earth from space at the end - check
And special- Paris, Eifels Tower in ruins - check.
Oh no."
4,"You know the scenes where you go ""oh come on, why in hell would anyone do that ?!"". Well, this movie is packed with characters having poor judgment and taking the most idiotic decisions possible (and being hysterical), and it's all done for the sole purpose of generating obstacles and create tension.
And it works ! It does create a lot tension, but it's all aimed towards the scenarists, for blatantly taking you for an imbecile.
You'll very quickly find yourself wishing for the death of some of the main characters, which would make things so much better, but then the movie would last only 15/20 minutes."
5,The planet is about to be destroyed by an asteroid and we only have x hours before it strikes. I expected them to call Bruce Willis again to do some off-world digging but he must be under house arrest.We're following Gerard Butler and his family as they try to get to a safe place in Greenland while the world around them turns into chaos. Other people seem to put more efforts into looting shops for toilet paper or holding end-of-the-world parties making their route a bit like the Road.Gerard trying to save his family and driving his ridiculously oversized car through meteoroids: it's all forget-about-corona-for-two-hours mindless fun!
6,"This is just an overall mess of a movie and I love disaster films.It seems like the disaster theme takes a back seat to the family drama in this film. There are loads of scenes with the parents and all of their scenes trying to pull he art strings or get the tension up. The comets could be easily replaced with a California wild fire and this would be the same film.A lame film with a few truly awfully bad scenes with overall terrible plot development. The lead is a guy who constructs buildings, so of course he's going to be a VIP in the new world after the comet hits.Extremely poor writing. The lead character drives onto a runway and prevents a plane from taking off. The pilot and he argue says it's at full capacity. Hero Gerald says take his wife and son and is refused. So Gerald replies that no one will be leaving, basically blackmailing the pilot here. Pilot reluctantly agrees to take the kid then and the mother erupts demanding he take all 3 of them. Pilot sighs and asks the hero Gerald how much do you weight? Hero lies about his weight and is called out. Lol what?! The pilot then accepts them all and this entitled family says sorry to the other passengers as they board the plane. GTFO."
7,"What a mess, the child just keeps sitting and waiting... for christmas?"
8,Nevermind the bad reviews! This movie is awesome. I swear people are so hard to please these days. This film definitely had my heart racing. It got extremely intense there several times. This has to be one of my favorite disaster flicks. Deep Impact eat your heart out. I highly recommend giving this movie a watch. 8 stars üëçüëç
9,"Let's start with the good: the natural disaster, the way the media and the people seem to react to it, the somewhat limited amount of cgi to leave a lot to the imagination, all make for a nice background to the main story, which do drag you into the atmosphere.However, the main plot is such a poor written mess, filled with age old recipes, a which seem to turn the movie into a series of fetch quests, which just are tedious to look at, and make no sense at all.A waste of potential by trying to add some drama, which wouldn't even be needed as the event is dramatic enough as it is."
10,"This movie is a classic end-of-the-world hero flick that ticks all the right boxes. Of course, Gerard Butler is awesome and although there are no surprises when it comes to the main plot, enough unpredictable events happen to keep you entertained on the edge of your seat."
11,Barbecue. Small comet hits. Driving. Airport. Loosing people. Looking for people. Driving. Fighting. Looking for people. Driving. Finding people. Driving. Fragments hits. Even more driving. Flying. Army base. Big comet hits. End.
12,At times i found it boring and just thought to my self when is this going to end. Didnt impress me at all. Effects were good tho and characters were not that bad either. At the beggining of the movie i thought this had potential of being a great film. I was clearly wrong.
13,"I love disaster movies but still had rather low expectations for this one. I hoped for a pleasant surprise but unfortunately it was an unpleasant one. Everything was cliche and not in the way that still can make a movie exciting. Everything was expected, even when the director tried to surprise the viewer. That makes for a movie that really shouldn't even be screening on the cinema, but be released straight to a streaming service. I was truly disappointed as I like Gerard Butler movies normally, but this script just didn't cut it."
14,"Horrible movie, characters are so annoying, the wife and the kid is both annoying and stupid, hope they died in the film"
15,"The following sentence wraps up the entire movie: There is a giant comet headed your way, when an automated alert suddenly appears, you continue to shop as if nothing is wrong, then when it is confirmed, you let your family waste hours packing clothes, lots of them, yet you forget to take anything that will help you survive a perpetual cold and dark world. Genius!!! Who writes this things?"
16,"Greenland is a raw, tension-filmes disaster film that showcases both the noble and dark sides of human nature, when everyone knows the end of the world is near.With spectacular visuals and an emotional narrative that is framed by the harrowing experiences of one family, this movie should definitely be enjoyed on the Big screen"
17,"Don't waste your time with this boring movie it is very very clich√©, and all the action scene can be seen in the trailer."
18,"Whenever I see a disaster movie, I want to know the science and the cause behind it and how the world will or will not change. What I don't want to see is a guy trying to save his wife and child for 2 hours, the egoistic pursuit of a microorganism (family) to save their own little asses, ignoring friends, other relatives, neighbors, other children, stepping on everyone and everything to get themselves saved. It irritates me endlessly whenever I see a movie, where the actor is repeatedly screaming ""MY WIFE AND KID, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE"" I don't want to see a disaster movie being romanticized, and idealized into the happily ever ending relationship between man and woman, and the idealized version of a sweet little happy family. Why does Hollywood need to center all their movies around these biases? This movie is way too cliched. Man and woman divorced, husband cheated, woman is angry, man is trying to do his best, has major regrets. A child being ill, needs constant medication. What exactly was this movie about? According to the short description: A family struggles for survival in the face of a cataclysmic natural disaster. No they are not struggling for survival, they are trying to get to a save place, and once they finally get there bumm, it's all over.Dear Hollywood,Why not write an original script for once without these clich√©s? Please Hollywood can you do that? Can you give as a real disaster movie?"
19,"SPOILERS........Compared to whoever wrote this nonsense I'm a towering genius.......They copy the Supermarket chemist scene directly from World War Z. Same reason for being there, kid needs medication. This film was so poor I couldn't quite believe it could ever get green lit. Totally unrealistic scenes. An apocalyptic scenario outside and yet they open a huge cargo plane ramp door to let one man off and it results in the whole plane being destroyed. Pathetic. Can't comment on it after an hour as I stopped watching. My brain hurt"
20,"Heres whst I found out by googling for two mins.. 9 mile wide (14km) is around the size that killed the dinosaurs possibly a bit larger, so that would mean massive tsunamis, extreme volcanic activity around the impact zone and accross the globe, the ozone layer would be destroyed, the sun would be completely blocked out, most of the earths crust would be damaged and thrown into the earths atmosphere which it would then rain down on the earth as fire for possibly decades, the earth would be like living in an oven, and almost everything on the planet would burn or die due to lack off food or the initial devestation. No way would you be able to go outside hours, days, weeks or even months after this happened and see the sun shining and a few birds flying around. I like disaster movies but come on, make some effort to research the effects of a giant 9 mile wide comet fragment colliding with earth not to mention the numerous other fragments."
21,"In the last few years Gerard Butler, sadly, has become a synonym for a movie flop. There has rarely been a movie in the last five years with Butler in it, that was not either bad or completely awful.
The last of which, to name few were, the last part of the Fallen Trilogy, ""Angel has Fallen"", the less than exciting WWII thriller ""Hunter Killer"" and one of the worst movies to be made in the last few years, ""Geostorm"".
Knowing all this I went into ""Greenland"" with a certain level of skepticism. Luckily, Butler seems to have gotten a lot smarter in his choices because ""Greenland"" is a quite entertaining motion picture.
While I am not a fan of disaster movies, mostly because they always follow the same boring concept namely, a family or gets separated for some stupid reason and tries to find each other again over the next two hours while their journey is complicated by various obstacles of human or nature kind.
""Greenland"" is no doubt a disaster movie but fortunately it is a little more exciting and creative than most of its kind over the last few years have been.
The movie begins with John Garrity (Butler) visiting his wife Allison (Morena Baccarin) and their son Nathan. John and Allison are separated but they seem to get along fine. Nathan is fascinated by the stars and the asteroid that is shooting towards earth. Soon the Garritys invite some friends over, when a presidential alert appears on their TV and phone telling them to pack some bags and drive to a close by airfield.
When they get there they are ushered in and just before they are about to board the plane the separation plot kicks in. Admittedly it's not as stupid as usual.
Now this might sound like your typical disaster movie but trust me it's not quite.
""Greenland"" is smart in how it handles it's characters and the plot is not always straight forward.
The movie tries less to create tension with the looming disaster but rather does so through the human element and the different characters the family members meet on their way.
We only get to experience what the family members do. There are no five or six main characters that each have their own agenda.
Even when they're separated, the Garritys stay the focus of the movie. They meet good and bad people along their journey and what I liked in particular was the honesty with which the director handles these characters. Many people are selfish and greedy and even in situations like this one, where working together is most important, people still only think of themselves.
The movie works also because Butler and Baccarin have a very good chemistry. They are the couple that has had hard times but still loves each other and would do anything to stay a family.
Butler is really good here. As good as he hasn't been in years. It's not a very difficult role or something that would be beyond his skillset but it is more serious and dramatic than his usual tough guy parts. Quite a few times I was happy to see that he can do more than growl and butcher an American accent. Granted, he still butchers it but at least his character is so charming and likable that we can overlook it.
The love and tenderness he shows in his face a few times is one I have never seen of him and, in a particularly important scene, we see the self loathing and disgust in his face.
I believe he always had it in him and I am glad he finally chose a movie that allowed him to bring out his full talent.
Baccarin is good too, especially on her own. She hasn't had too many major roles yet in movies but I hope she will soon. She really is a capable actress.
""Greenland"" is certainly worth watching and if you have the chance and the current situation allows it, go see it next month when it's released. It makes for a welcome change of pace."
22,"Generic 2020s Cinema from start to finish, 1 Hour 59m later. Title 'Greenland' was a one-word spoiler, symptomatic of this Big Hollywood's biggest failing - a patent lack of imagination. The flic was at least entertaining, released as it was to vie for top Christmas spot, but it was just too darned predictable. With these vast sums of money to waste to deliver sophistication, why on Earth couldn't some of those dollars've been used to find a Writer? The movie 2012 was a terrifying but original concept. But sorry, that one's been taken."
23,"A man is warned to seek shelter as a comet and it's smaller gravity-locked companions decide that planet earth would be a good way to break its fall. Gerard Butler is that man.Thus begin the trials of Gerard and his wife and son.
Not in attempting to stop the comet or to survive the impact or it's aftermath. Come on, that's been done. No, you are instead a witness to their attempts to find shelter, for 2 hours!Why Greenland?
Could it be because the largest impact crater was recently discovered there, under an icesheet. The biggie that is now believed to have triggered the last ice age? Nope. Something to do with the previous location of the magnetic North pole perhaps? Not even close although both would have been worthwhile.Greenland is the man's destination for safety when an extinction level event occurs. That's it.
If the safe haven was in Wisconsin or Jumanji, that's what the movie would have been titled.So what goes on for 2 hours?
World leaders uniting to save the species perhaps? Nyet! Missiles? Railguns? Armageddon-style suicide missions and secret projects for evacuation to Mars? NOPE!
How about the impact itself, do we get to see that? Sorry.
Well, everything except all the above.You get drama, with dad getting off the evacuation flight for his son's insulin that was left in the car. Who knew?
There's action, like rioting and looting.
It has traffic snarls as people try to drive somewhere, anywhere to presumably get off the film.And it has clich√©s, notably, one at the start that is destined to be the new must-have disaster movie clich√®. Being informed that you must evacuate immediately and to only bring your wife and diabetic son, while your phone is set on speaker at a neighbourhood get-together.
Talk about a new record for losing friends. Anyhow, new clich√® and you saw it first in Greenland!It goes downhill from there.
This disaster movie sets the bar so low that Deep Impact would be Oscar-winning material.
To be fair, Gerard is an actor in demand and he is prolific, so one can forgive him for this stinker.
He was due and I vote comet.Is it too early for Razzie nominations?
Skip that. Let's announce 2020's winner now, please?"
24,"I must admit that I was certainly expecting more from this 2020 disaster movie than what writer Chris Sparling and director Ric Roman Waugh actually managed to deliver with ""Greenland"".Well now, don't get me wrong, because I am not saying that this is a bad movie, nor am I saying it is a movie that isn't entertaining or enjoyable. It certainly was. However, the movie was just way too generic, mundane and predictable. And for a disaster movie, then I am afraid to say that the movie was frightfully devoid of massive scale destruction.Visually then ""Greenland"" was good, however, I was hoping to get to see a lot more destruction as the meteor and the fragments made contact with Earth. There were a few destruction scenes, and they most definitely were good to look at, no doubt about it. But for a disaster movie, then there just wasn't nowhere near enough of destruction and pure CGI mayhem throughout the course of this movie. It should be said, though, that the CGI and special effects that were in the movie definitely were convincing and looked very real and good on the screen. So thumbs up to the CGI and special effects crew.""Greenland"" felt more like a family drama laced with some end-of-the-world disaster theme. At no point throughout the course of the movie did I really feel like the world was about to end. Sure, it was mentioned in the movie and the premise was staged for it, but director Ric Roman Waugh just didn't come through. I have to admit that I didn't really sit down to watch ""Greenland"" because of the family drama going on between John Garrity (played by Gerard Butler) and Allison Garrity (played by Morena Baccarin) amidst an end-of-the-world scenario. No, I was here for the end of the world and the spectacular effects showcasing the destruction. But sadly, ""Greenland"" wasn't really all that great in terms of being a disaster movie.The movie does have a good ensemble of actors and actresses, and I will say that both Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin carried the movie quite well, and the child actor, Roger Dale Floyd, definitely also added something good with his performance. It was nice to see Scott Glenn in the movie, just a shame that he wasn't given more screen time.While ""Greenland"" is watchable and entertaining for what it turned out to be, I just felt cheated out of a grand disaster movie experience; one that I thought would have put the 2009 disaster movie ""2012"" to shame and knocked it off of its seat in the throne of disaster movies.My rating of ""Greenland"", once the ash has settled, stands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars. The movie was just way too generic and following a very strict run-of-the-mill-how-to-make-a-disaster-movie blueprint."
25,"The idea that the USA could build a enormous 'secret' bunker in a foreign country to save only Americans in the event of a global disaster is lip-bitingly difficult to get past. If you can though, enjoy the rest of this "" I love you Daddy, I love you Son"", comedy-drama, which beats Armageddon hands-down for tongue-in-cheek end of the world humanity scenarios."
26,"A decent end of the world movie that deals with what would happen on the ground.
Follows one family, and their interactions with other desperate people.
Reasonable acting, and nice special effects.Worth watching."
27,"Great effects and Tired story,
but don't like to be constantly bombarded (no pun intended) with Woke messages.
These scenarios of White bad non White good are just as dangerous as the other way round, just make it real and stop preaching please."
28,"This movie had everything to be good and how come it ended up this?
I just couldn't stop wining since after the first half hour of it because it was just terrible, almost painful to watch. I actually got headache watching it.
The story is not based on the disaster about to happen, is basically just drama, bad decisions and bad everything. I don't think I can write all bad about it otherwise I would write a testimony here.
How a mom let her soon be kidnapped like she did? She couldn't untie the boy from the sit belt, grabbed his hand and didn't let those people take him? And if he depends of insulin to live how come she don't have it on her personal purse, her jacket, pockets???
The whole drama started because of the God damn insulin!!!
Many scenes I felt like was a cheap copy of 2012 and the rest is all about drama not evolving the catastrophe about to happen, don't waste your time!
I gave it a 2 just because the history has potential to actually be something good, don't get it how it ended up being so bad."
29,"Wanted to like this.Found it impossible.It's a 'dumb' film. One of those films where the characters make dumb decisions at every turn. So dumb that as the film goes on, you hope something bad happens to them.These types of films are insulting to the mind.
It's not even in the mind-numbing-veg-out category. It's simply bad.Bad, bad, bad, bad.Acting is whatever, filming is whatever, storyline is bad.We should be able to sue film makers when things are this bad, for recompense for the time of our lives wasted watching it. In this case 2 hours.If you like dumb films, with dumb decisions then this is for you.Sure was not for me.1/10"
30,"I liked this movie. Yes like most disaster movies it has the standard recipe of a divorced/nearly divorced family, I still don't get why. The movie shows some special effects of impacts but this is no 2012, this movie is mostly about the breakdown of society when all of the sudden everyday people are confronted with despair. I find it amusing how some comments here are about characters in the movie are portrayed negative and selfish only caring about their own family. Newsflash for you ... that's what people tend to do in a situation of life and death. You ever look at reports in the news of people clawing each others eyes out at food distribution in war zones? They know very well more food is coming. Now imagine the whole world being faced with imminent death ... it will not be pretty. Frankly I would be like that group partying till the music stops.Spoilers:
Now as regarding the ending. They arrived at the base in Greenland with the diabetic kid. How did this kid survive 9 months when it was clear in the beginning they were avoiding people requiring longterm medicines? After all when they ran in the Cold War shelter it clearly looked unused since decades. Everyone only knew about the comet since a few days so it's not like they could prepare the place.Since when did places like New Delphi and Sao Paulo have nuclear blast grade old Cold War shelters?Also 9 months!?! I know they need some positive fluff at the end of American movies or they won't do well in the box office over there. But anyone paying attention in science class would remember that after the Yucatan impact it was suspected the skies did not properly clear for several years.So I am still giving it an 8 because the acting was good and so was the overall story. Science and disaster movies have never been the best of friends, it remains a fiction story after all."
31,"Its way too long with not much at all happening, its all drama no thriller. everyone is stupid and do only stupid shizz :) in real life they would be the first to die."
32,"This Movie is an absulute piece of trash i know usually disaster movies are not oscar winning but this one was really bad feels rushed same dumb trying to save my family plot like always, movies like this are always about family drama but i think The Day After Tomorrow,2012,Geostorm they were enjoyable and had much better disaster scenes"
33,"Too clich√©, nothing new. A one in a dozen movie. Nothing I will remember this movie for. Last 30 minutes were mediocre at best."
34,"I will suggest people to watch ""Deep Impact"" again instead of watching this total waste of time piece. No one wants to watch 3 people trying to survive running here and there.
This movie should be removed from Sci-fi category and put in family cliche drama. There are tons of better sci-fi movies. How can someone rewrite script on well known subject, as this useless garbage."
35,"Greenland (2020) feels as if the filmmakers wanted to make a profound social/political statement, but lacked the foggiest notion of what to say. Or perhaps they earnestly believed the incoherent babbling that comes across is somehow deeply profound.The earth is about to be struck by a comet which will trigger an extinction-level event, only this is no ordinary comet, but a Hollywood comet. It's existence comes as a complete surprise. NASA tracks the precise paths of 20,000 near-Earth asteroids, 500,000 pieces of space junk, and several thousand satellites, but somehow missed a humongous comet headed directly for us that could wipe out all life on the planet. This comet will wreak havoc and destruction over a course of several days, first with some chunks large enough to wipe out entire cities, then with a meteor shower of molten metal, and finally with a chunk the size of Manhattan, which will wipe out nearly all living creatures.The filmmakers don't explain how NASA could miss noticing so many objects hurtling toward the planet or how all these fragments manage to remain on the roughly the same trajectory and hit a moving target travelling at 107,000 km/hour or 2.5 million kilometers a day.Fortunately (for a lucky few), the president will implement Dr Strangelove's plan, except without the polygamy, and fly ""the chosen"" to Greenland to wait out the coming Ice Age in huge underground bunkers. Apparently Trump managed to buy the island in secret, as Denmark doesn't seem to need these bunkers for their own citizens. One wonders how such a plan would have evolved in real life. Trump would have insisted on a merit-based selection process, while Pelosi and Schumer would have withheld funding unless the chosen represent the ethnic and cultural diversity of the populace, with spots reserved for undocumented aliens and geriatric politicians. The filmmakers never try to explain how the chosen are chosen. The president is never seen, reduced to a disembodied robocall voice.Garrity (Gerard Butler) and his family must contend with the forces of nature, an uncaring bureaucracy, a society that has devolved into anarchy, various criminals, and existential dilemmas - the grist of several distinct (and not necessarily compatible) movie genres. The result is an incoherent pastiche of familiar tropes and scenes derived from other films."
36,"Total waste of time, clich√© after clich√© until you choke on them.........."
37,"This movie is lacking any kind of action. You would think that with this kind of budget and an amazing cast, something good and interesting would definitely have a lot of WOW moments, no such luck. It's just under 2 hours of extreme boredom. The plot falls flat, the editing is a joke and the characters have no depth to them at all. Do yourself a favor and just fast forward to the one scene worth watching...the end credits."
38,"If you introduce a child's ailment in the first act, it has to be used by the second act. The fingerprints of talentless executives is all over this. Someone said, ""the kid has to be sick so it can be a plot point later."" They also said ""the marriage is on the rocks only to be rejuvenated by the end."" Plus the classic ""The family has to be separated so they can impossibly find each other later."" And don't forget ""There's gotta be an old crank who refuses to leave his home, even though he's going to die.""Someday I'd like to see a disaster movie without all the tired cliches. The challenge is writing a story that doesn't have to rely on ""classic"" tropes."
39,"World is experiencing extinction event. A family have been chosen by a lottery to be amongst those to be saved. They are about to take off on a military plane (to be taken to a safe location). A disaster is about to strike soon...in a matter of forty something hours. Not leaving with the plane means almost certain death...Amidst all the chaos they realise that they have lost insulin for the kid....father runs to a soldier and asks ""When is the plane leaving? Do I have enough time to go and get it?"" (note that at the same time there are hundreds of people trying to aggressively break into the facility to get onto the plane with them).He does not ask: ""Do you have insulin or a medical care at the location where we are going?""It goes downhill from there. Turned it off about 15 minutes later."
40,"All the white people in this movie are portrayed as terrible people. It's mainly white people looting. And when an armed gang enters the sore being looted, yep all white bar one guy. It's a white couple who kidnap the main character's son, a couple of white guys who attack the main character in the back of truck and a white woman medical official who has no time for the main female character trying to find her son.In contrast, all the black people in the movie are saint-like. The one black guy with the gang of armed looters helps the main character get out of danger, the one black guy in the back of the truck befriends and then defends the main character from attack by the two white guys in the truck, a black female military officer breaks protocol to try and help the main female character and her son, and a black medical volunteer comes to the main female character's aid when brushed aside by the white volunteer.It's such a blatant white bad, black good attempt at virtue signalling that I thought I was watching a feature length Gillette advertisement. I found it hard to concentrate on the story of Butler and Baccarin's respective characters running around aimlessly, as every time they faced adversity, a dark knight would come along and save the moment.Utter pap!"
41,"I saw the trailer for this in the cinema, it looked liked the film that 2012 should have been but, no! it was worse. Why watch this when you can watch Independence Day?? A selection of characters I did not care about a draining and disappointing film that should be castaway to the dustbin of history."
42,"Boring and disappointed , not on the levrl we used to have from this actor. I dont recommend , waste of timr"
43,"This movie is a scam. This is like watching World War Z. Although it is not about zombies, it is almost an exact copy of the ""Z"" movie. It is easy to predict what is going to happen next. This movie is just waste of time. awful, awful and once again awful."
44,The name of the movie should have been Diabetic as the story was more about insulin than a comet.
45,I don't get the bad reviews its pretty good considering most 2020 movies sucked this one starts out kinda slow but 15 mins in it gets interesting and intense throughout I was on the edge until the end I thought Gerard and cast did exceptionally well
46,"Ahh Hollywood movies. There is something so nice, tender, and predictable about the sequence of events that unfolds.We start off with the typical protagonist introduction, a boss man doing construction things. But things really kick into high gear when we are introduced to Morena Baccarin running on a treadmill, because you know women - they get fat and they need to exercise like all the time. Then of course she opens her mouth and its the usual women stuff, so you can go get a snack and come back in 5 minutes. They'll include some kid scene that is annoying and cringe for everyone involved, but you are still in the kitchen getting a snack, so its tolerable.I'm only 10 minutes in but you can tell this movie will end the way it started - predictably, boring, probably large sound effects, a few million in pyrotechnics and more cringe worthy lines. Looking forward to it!Edit: Yep. It was boring AF."
47,"REVIEW - GREENLANDFirstly this is not like any of the other metior films you may have seen previously, why?Basically a previously unknown metior is heading towards earth, no one can be sure where it will strike and random people are chosen to go to shelters in Greenland, you follow the story of one such family trying to get to one of these shelters.Cone on! How stupid do you think we are? An unknown metior and not knowing where it will impact, with all of the resources at our disposal this is simply not true.In this film in some ways it is more realistic compared to other similar films where the metiors seen to aim themselves but in order ways it is actually very annoying.Annoying because 2 major parts of this film were included just to ramp up the suspence but for me both I felt.......Firstly if someone was chosen to go to a shelter you would think the government would know of a long term medical condition, secondly if a married couple wanted to steal the wrist bands why not simply steal them both and not do what they did with the son?Lazy writing once again!What promised to be an excellent film because of the above actually turned out to be quite a disappointment and honestly just skip the first 90 minutes of the film trying to build up the characters because you honesty don't care about them.Rating 5 out of 10"
48,"This is like people who can't cook and just keep adding salt to a dish thinking it will improve it, but replace salt with explosions.The grimmest dystopia I could ever imagine is a world where you can only watch movies with Gerard Butler. Yikes! I need a hug just thinking about that.Without even watching a single second of this movie, I can tell it won't be good because it's too long at 1h59m, a common sin of movie makers in the direct to TV era. We really don't need to see what a loving father he is. Let's just assume that bit and fast-forward to why we are watching this mess in the first place: a disaster.YOu hear about movies that are so bad that they are good, like campy or whatever. This isn't one of those movies. This is so bad that it's freaking horrible.The meteor hit Florida, America's toilet. Good riddance. Can it hit Ohio next? And then the rest of the hillbilly states? Sorry, too soon after the election?The government plan seems to be to save America's most annoying families."
49,"We are living in corona times and due to the environment around us this movie gets into your mind and makes you believe that the world is actually going to end.A superb movie with amazing storytelling and direction.
My favorite Gerard Butler is doing a top class acting. The leading lady also did amazing job.You can put this movie in the category of The Day After Tomorrow and 2012.Watch this movie because it's entertaining and so griping that you will forget the real world around you and start believing the movie.Watch it at night with lights off."
50,"There!
That's what the film is all about...
Greenland is dumb...there is no story. We only see people scared and lost and going this way and that way.
Of all all the end-of-world films I've seen, Greenland is one of the lamest.
There is nothing special about it, pretty vanilla..
Not even PC proselytism shows up in the film.
I recommend you watch the first ten minutes and the last 10 minutes, this way you do not have to waste two hours with it."
51,"I don t understand why some comments here refer to the repetitive standard disaster movie lay out. This is a movie about an impact from space, so of course the elements used are going to be similar then those in previous space rock movies.It s like making another Jaws movie and complaining about sharks being in it. This one was done however with few but very efficient and convincing effects. I seldomly consider a film good enough to merit a 10, but this one is outstanding. Two hours of solid entertainment done on the fraction of the budget of many other disaster movies. Absolutely brilliant."
52,"Also needed more shots of the big one hitting and soon after. Just a family running around trying to find each other with a few fireballs.
Considering these types of movie have been done before, you'd expect this one to be better.
Shame."
53,"I watched this Saturday after other new release, Airliner Sky Battle. My fiance and I laughed a lot at both movies. But this one was made with about 100x the money. Some scenes resembled God hurling hot rocks at a moving car. Surely meteor showers would land randomly across all of Earths surface? This movie was also far too violent, and not suitable for young viewers. Do they ever think of us?"
54,The best disaster film ever don't listen to do guys that said 6.5 cause it's a ten trust se this film
55,"Ok this released here in part of Europe last week, most of Europe by first week of August. This is clearly being done to avoid being slammed by US critics for the awful junk that it is.
Firstly the plot makes no sense at all from either a science perspective, a social perspective or a human interest perspective. OK so we all do all occasionally suspend our disbelief AND IQ for plenty of action films. But in those cases we do so for great action. This has no compelling action, in fact it is pitiful.
What is left is a turgid, endless stream of cliche: ""family drama.""Oh and Greenland might be a decent refuge in full on global warming. But massive asteroid strikes cause massive cooling similar to nuclear winter and you would want to be in the tropics."
56,Why would the kid not get out of the car? Makes no sense.
57,"After auch an event, ash inducing ice age would remain in the atmosphere for years but here they magically disappear after a little while. The silly consolatory ending destroys the little good that there was in the movie."
58,"Strongly emotions. lived every moment of the film. Yes, there are inconsistencies, but you forget about them if you put yourself in the place of the main character."
59,"Its 2012 al over, but worse. Unrealistic decisions
Stimulating people to believe in complot theories.
Total disappoint..."
60,"Solid film with some great suspense, acting and action sequences, but the plot is very similar to other disaster movies. So that felt a little clish√©. Still a very fun popcorn flick, would recommend for any disaster movie fan."
61,"I thought the script it's self was too plain, there was nothing at all intelligent in it. The acting was most just some pained looks of some peoples faces while running about without a clue what to do. I couldn't blame them for the decisions that they were making but it would have been nice to have seen them make one interesting choice.It fell well below expectation for me main due to the fact that even though I knew there probably wouldn't be much in the way of neat special fx, it was more that what fx there were were not that good. And the fact there wasn't enough dialog. If you are not going to have one you should at least have some of the other. Instead we spend too much time looking at people sitting in their car with the occasional jump out of the car, get into the car, jump out of the car, get into the car. And on the movie goes."
62,Enjoyable not overstated with distinctive charactersrecommend to see for sure. all fans of catastrophic movies will be not disappointment
63,"Nothing new.Well, actually there was something new and I didn't like it. It was the fact that the storyline was 99% traffic and chaos (+ a weird guy that wanted to kidnap a child for some reason I don't understand) and 1% action and destruction.Movie is called Greenland, but shows nothing of it besides some ashy wasteland and two birds flying. Yes, omg, we're so happy.I mean, of course you can't expect an excellent burger if you decide to eat at Mc Donald's, but this was not good. It was bad and not the guilty pleaure kind of bad.Ah well, imma watch Sharknado 4 now, see ya.."
64,"Well, I think so, and here i'll explain why his might be one of the best of it's kind, and then I'm talking about realistic catastrophe movie with good acting a.s.o.Greenland is not only a two hours thrill-ride, it's also an intelligent and quite realistic catastrophe movie. My thoughts went to The Towering Inferno (1974) and Norwegian The Wave (2015), and the very best The Impossible (2012). And I rule out the alien-kind like Indendence day, which isn't that good either.The film has great story up-building, and doesn't tell to much on why things are like they are, questions will still be answered later on. No over-explaining, but tension-up-building in a good way. the film also make us care about the main persons, and they sweat, scream, are breathing heavy after a run. All actors are ding a great job. The film is well acted, and full of great actors, even in the smaller roles.When you then also ads a plausible story and mostly very good CGI then there can't be much going wrong. (OK not all CGI is perfect, but its good, especially the fires and comet-fractions.)
But the film even takes time to ask very good questions - I won't reveal them here, but the film can actually both make a debate, as well as change how we will react to a comet hitting the earth.The film also is careful not stereotyping, it's very generous and all in all not only a good script, but als very well made.
Kudos to Ric Roman Waugh which really is a film maker to look out for. I love his Felon, Shot Caller and Snitch, which all were impressive. But this is in fact his most impressive so far! Go see it in theaters if you can.
This film deserves a large screen - and I'll go watch again tomorrow!"
65,Absolute garbage movie! Poorly executed and terrible acting.
66,"It's definitely far from the best movie made, but a good way to pass the time on a weekend night. At the end, I didn't feel as if it was a waste of my time..Pretty standard disaster movie plot: World ending, safe haven, family gets separated. I'd say give it a watch."
67,"There's nothing like timing a disaster film to coincide with a similar real-life event - minus the devastating consequences of course.Ric Roman Waugh's Greenland has been released just as the comet Neowise is coursing through our skies. The astronomical phenomena was at its brightest on 22 July, becoming as bright as the North Star and visible without visual aids, creating a stir around the world. The comet in Greenland however, had a very different idea.Dubbed 'Clark', the cosmic entity was announced to be a spectacular and harmless viewing event. Then it became that a rogue piece had entered the atmosphere, but would mostly burn itself out and land in the ocean. Everyone was thrilled, until the piece made landfall... in Central Florida.Greenland follows the Garrity family as they make their way to safety. Gerald Butler and Morena Baccarin are estranged couple John and Allison, who work together to bring their son Clayton (Scott Glenn) to their ordained government shelter.Replete with catastrophic events as the urgency builds up, the film's visuals are worth looking out for, both for its terrifying scale yet surreal beauty. It is one of the highlights, even as an extinction-level fragment is making its way within 48 hours of the first impact.Waugh's focus is on the family and their tribulations, so don't expect it to be all smooth sailing. But part of the film is also used to showcase a bitter side of humanity, as people disregard the greater good for the sake of self-preservation. Other than Neowise, the messaging also hits home with the pandemic, as the world struggles to cope with errant behaviour from the public. It's extremely disturbing in that expect.That said, the way it is executed comes across a little trite at times. From a scene of some strangers partying (the hedonists), to a couple that hijacks a situation (the false samaritan), writer Chris Sparling's vignettes are much too cliche for the seasoned audience. Waugh also directs these scenes with little depth, often over delivering on the messaging as characters stir up their motives. Trust me, it's very clear who's good or bad in this film.When the family gets separated, these episodes get even more pronounced. And worse still, the situations they run into veer dangerously into caricatures themselves. There's only that many stalled highways and hitchhikes you can take, and the way people drop in and out of the main thread discourages any emotional investment from the viewer.It's not that Waugh doesn't try, but the episodes are repetitive in formula and so after a while, you just know what to expect. And for a disaster movie, that's not very exciting.But while the side characters are bland, Greenland's biggest lack comes from its main cast - they're not very likeable at all.Throughout the film, the family ditches friends, emotionally-blackmails officers, and at parts even endangers everyone else for the sake of saving their family. While this ode to family loyalty is admirable to a point, the situations start to make the Garrity's seem entitled. And no one really wants to root for entitled folks.From non-stop badgering for information from officers trying to do their job, to allowing exceptional waivers for their case, they throw the greater good out into the wind without so much as a blink of an eye.Waugh tries to negate this with some scenes of the Garrity doing good to a random stranger, but they are so random that you'll be more puzzled than convinced that these are people you should be cheering on.So while Greenland still wins for its premise and effects (minus the incredibly flat orange color grading), the lack of endearment to the characters leaves the title without much impact."
68,"The same kind of story as any ""end of the world"" movie, but worse. Less action than in Armageddon, less performance than in Deep Impact. Even 2012 or The Day After Tomorrow were 10 times better. Gerard Butler didn't made me believe in his character one second, Morena Baccarin is just OK. And until 5 minutes before the end, you ask yourself why is this movie called Greenland ? There are maybe 15 seconds of what is supposed to be Greenland in this movie... Go watch something else, anything else actually."
69,Props to director of this movie. The panic and disasters felt very real. CGI wasn't good sometimes tbh.But overall I didn't expect this movie to be so good. It was really intense.
70,That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in 2020. Seriously! I think the movie should be 7.0 at least.
71,"Honestly I was shocked by the bad scenarios that were used in this movie, it's totally junk"
72,"Another crappy movie where millions of people die but, hey! The three unlikable main characters got saved, after sorting out stupid situation after stupid stuation and endangering everyone else with their selfish behaviour. And right, yeah, governments spend public money building bunkers in case they have to save engineers and their families in case of a meteorite strikes Earth, and also, good Samaritans carry people on their airplanes from Canada to Greenland just for free, and at first you can only get to the bunkers strictly if you are elected by said government, but then it doen¬¥t matter anymore and you just can knock on their doors and soldiers will send a truck to pick your sorry ass...and the list goes on and on..."
73,"Yes, you read the title right!If you expect to see impressive visual effects of comets raining down on the globe and destroying civilization as our hero runs for his life, then prepare for disappointment.The movie is basically a family drama with the disaster as a backdrop in a few very short sequences here and there, some of which are happening off screen.Nothing here that you have not seen done before and better by other movies of the genre... The 4 stars are for the cast's efforts and the rare disaster scenes."
74,Another doomsday movie predictible from the start.if it was that simple to get to the bunker and get in everyone should have been able to.its 2012 but meteors in place of earthquakes and volcanoes. hollywood should try and change things up
75,"Story-wise it was completely pointless movie. What was it even about?The whole time we mostly see faces of main characters, but it tells us nothing about them. We see humanity fail, but in the same time it's flaws are not fleshed out, nor even put in the focus. We see disaster on the background kinda just beign there and doing nothing...Honestly it could have beign a movie about a couple going on vacation and having some minor problems on the road."
76,"More holes than plot.
Gerard Butler.
End of the world.
Yada yada yada."
77,"This movie should not have been made, let alone watched. The actors lost any sort of credibility by starring in the 2 hour long lobotomy. Unmake this movie!"
78,What a shame that I have wasted my time with this movie.
79,All hype. Pathetic plot. Terrible movie. Waste of time.
80,"Cheap visual effects.
Very predictable storyline.
Very cheesy and shallow conversations.Don't waste your money on it in the movie theater. A good movie to watch if you're bored and don't know anything better to watch at home."
81,"Ignore all of the bad reviews on here and enjoy this film for what it is, a totally entertaining piece of cinema. I was on no the edge of my seat the whole way through. Exciting, moving and ultimately satisfying. Loved it."
82,"John Alan Garrity (Gerald Butler) gets a notice from Homeland Security to grab his wife (Morena Baccarin ) and child (Roger Dale Floyd) and go to Robbins Airforce Base for relocation. (Plot spoiler: Greenland) A comet is striking the Earth in pieces. Long story short they all get separated, come together, and have to hitchhike to Greenland. Atlanta burning again.I was just not convinced or thrilled by the Asylum type of plot. Better disaster films out there.Guide: No sex or nudity. Rated for brief strong language that I missed."
83,"I give this a minus 400 out of 10 it is like watching a slow moving train wreck, you watch just hoping it may improve but no it sinks to the next lower level and keeps going until rock bottom"
84,"Probably not the best film for those witnessing the US pandemic response. Selfish people grinding any organized plan to a halt. I found myself being very pro-comet.On the positive side, at least there WAS an organized plan in this alternate timeline."
85,"First I must agree with the other reviewers: Yes, this movie entertains for the 2 hours it runs with special effects and classic disaster movie clich√©s. But this should not be the only demand on a movie.
After thinking about it several times, I found the film more boring and almost a bit cheeky from second to second. It seemed to me as if the screenwriters had looked at the film '2012' and thought, ""Man, we could actually shoot it again - just a little bit different"".
*** SPOILERS OF THE MOVIE '2012' AND 'GREENLAND' ***
2012: A man (divorced) learns about the imminent end of the world. He wants to save his family. They just make it away from home. From there an odyssey begins. Through his job and the info of a guy he meets by chance, he learns that there is an ark in China. There he wants to go. Shortly before the end they manage to get in illegally. The ark on which he now lives is one of a few. The film ends with the dramatic opening of the gates of the ark and that they can finally look out into the world. The end.Greenland (aka. 2020): A man (separated from his wife) learns about the imminent end of the world. Of course he wants to save his family. They make it away from home. From there their odyssey begins. Because of his important job and information from a guy he meets by chance, he learns that there is a bunker. There he wants to go with his family. Shortly before the end they manage to get in illegally. The bunker he now lives in is one of a few. The film ends with the dramatic opening of the gates of the bunker and that they can look out into the world (which is still standing). The end.
I know that the disaster movie genre cannot be reinvented in its basic features, but I am surprised how little new a film can show.Positive aspects:
one of the more 'realistic' disaster moviesSpecial effects - ok.unfortunately I can't think of any moreTotal: 3/10 stars. If you just want to watch a movie that will take your mind off Covid-19 for 2 hours and spoil it a bit with action and special effects, this is the right place. For all others who want to see a really good movie that will surprise and amaze them - Nah... Maybe another time."
86,"It's the same old run of the mill apocalyptic event where the cast race against certain doom. It is reminiscent of 2012, San Andreas, and Left Behind."
87,"5 production companies it took tk make this. It's clear not one wanted to take the risk with it for the money they will loose on it.
They take bits from Armageddon, Deep Impact, 2012, World War Z, which are easily recognisable.
Plot holes. Poor character development. Incomplete exposition.
Overall disappointing, depresing and will not be a future classic or box office hit."
88,"This is not a masterpiece but if you want two hours of excitement this one does the trick. Plenty of illogical decisions and maybe someone get ticked off by how slow they move in a emergency, but hey, I was jumping up and down shouting ""MOVE IT!"" And that's the way I want it in a good ""end of times movie"". I actually wanted more and my wife who often fall asleep when we watch films was wide awake to the end."
89,"Being waiting for this movie since long bt only thing i got after watching was disappointment.... problem's with story line, concept is goooooood"
90,"I am amazed. Graphics is the best. All look real. Fire, death, blood, comet, asteroid, protests. No thing looks fake. Topic is best, especially because it is based on or similar to current event of covid19 pandemic and on something serious like extinction, judgment day, etc. Actors also looks confident, experienced, real, and immersed into events. Comparable to best pandemic and apocalyptic movies like Resident Evil, Flu (Gamgi), Terminator, etc. Good to watch and emotional and exciting."
91,"Another mediocre film that stands out as being quite good by virtue of being compared to the legions of awful films coming out of Hollywood.
But it is worthwhile for audiences to accept a loss in quality entertainment when otherwise gaining so much from diversity hiring practices and progressive ideology passed off as the new normal.
All villains in Greenland are of white and every black person is a competent and caring person, absolutely as it should be!
More this film continues to push for the end of whiteness by having almost all couples mixed couples (excluding dues of course, that would be antisemitic) with the noticeable exception being the villain couple who had to remain white. Well done Hollywood and of course China (who owns the production companies via tencent)!"
92,"The camera keeps shaking like hell. I watched for about 30mins and got a headache and feels dizzle. Then, I just can't watch anymore. For the rest of the movie, I was pretty much sitting in the cimena and browsing webpages. Don't know why can't they just hold the camera still.
+1 for the story
-10 for the shot"
93,"An Asteroid hitting our beloved Earth, humanity going to extinction, seems like I have seen something like it before. Went to the Cinema expecting the same story line, but boy oh boy, I was left gasping for air. Story line was well written, showing exactly how love for family can be unbroken at times and the extents parents can go in Order to protect their loved ones.
Gerard Butler never disappoints."
94,"I read the synopsis and was so excited.
I feel like I died a little inside watching this. I felt myself getting angry and frustrated at a lot of scenes in the film that were, how should I put it, just ""stupid"". If you've seen the film you'll hopefully understand what I mean.
A lot of scenes added clearly Just to pad the film out. If they were cut out the film altogether it wouldn't affect the story arc whatsoever.
I had zero sympathy for the wife or the kid by the end of the film. To be honest I didn't even care if the family all found eachother becasue they came across as completely selfish and egotistical.
Best acting came from the comet."
95,I would say they used a lot of similar story to 2012 except ALOT less disaster and ALOT more drama. The Acting was amazing! But the storyline Had parts that dragged on forever.If there wasn't an occasional loud noise from a disaster I would have fallen asleep in the empty theater.Worth a one time watch but not worth the movie ticket price.
96,"Well, the film is about being too stupid to live. The characters are acting in such a stupid way that it makes the whole movie annoying. Please, comet... just kill them all! Yes, the comet is the true heroe here."
97,"If you are looking for an action filled, dooms day movie, this is will disappoint you. The movie is more drama-driven. Characters making weird decisions, weak backstory as to what happens and weird side stories kind of blur the strength of the story line.It's a good watch though. Entertaining, but predictable."
98,"Good film, a few non-sensical actions by the characters... making yourself ask, why did he/she do that?"
99,"A well done thriller film going in a equal level of eagerness throughout the movie. After first 15 min, I adopted to the atmosphere of the movie and started travelling with the characters. Unexpected twists has been the main strength of the film. Overall a two hour of thriller rolling over in our mind."
100,"First, let me confess and get this out of the way, I do like Gerard Butler.
However, that is not why I think this movie is so good.
This was a very well done, action-packed, end of the world film.
Was this film totally perfect? No.
Were there any mistakes made in the film? There may have been, but you would have to look very hard to find them.
The production values were very high. The acting was very well done. Everything had an expensive, polished look to it.
The cinematography, acting, editing, sound and SFX were all up there.
The budget I believe, was $35 million; and every single penny of that is up on the screen for you to enjoy.
DO NOT allow the negative reviewers to scare you away from watching this film!
If you do, you will be robbed of experiencing a very good action movie.
It seems like some people watch a movie with the sole intention of trying to pick it apart!
Some people say that all of this is been done before. Well maybe in a way, it has.
Think about it. Just how many different ways can you make an end of the world film?
Look where we are. It's 2020. Do you know how many end of the world movies have been made?!
Hundreds, if not thousands! So to be honest, it's kind of hard to come up with an idea that is completely original. They say the devil is in the details. The truth of the matter is that in all of these end of the world movies that have been made so far, the differences between them is in the details!
For instance, we already know (from the trailers) that a planet killing comet is going to hit.
And yes, we know that there are going to be people panicking, and experiencing hardships, and all kinds of destruction, etc., etc., etc.
So when you consider all the movies that are made with that general plot outline, the only way they can vary from each other is in all of the many details.
For instance, take a movie script, copy it 100 times, and give a copy to 100 different directors and film crews. When everything is said and done, you will end up with 100 movies all about the same thing.
But all of these movies will be completely different from each other. They will have a different look, feel, atmosphere, technical expertise, flavor, etc.
And the reason that they are all completely different from each other, is because there are so many 1000s and 1000s of small details that make up a movie that cause these movies to be completely different from each other.
So like I said, the devil is in the details. And the details are what make a movie either good or bad.
All in all, I think that Greenland is a very well done movie.
So yes, when you sit down to watch the movie, you already know that supposedly, a comet is going to destroy the world. But you don't really know exactly how it's going to happen. And you don't know exactly all of the infinitely small details that join together and ultimately bring you to that event.
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
Is it the 'comet ends the world film' to end all, 'comet ends the world films'? Probably not.
But this film is definitely worth watching. You will be thoroughly entertained.
All of the main actors are people that you actually end up caring about.
Were some aspects of the movie glossed over at the expense of other parts? Perhaps.
So all in all, let me just say this:
This was a very well done, action-packed, end of the world film.
And I believe that you will really enjoy it!
Because ultimately, the goal of a film such as this, is to entertain you.
And Greenland really succeeds."
101,"What if you put together in a blender 2012, San Andr√©s, Armageddon, but without those protagonists? This movie.
A crazy disaster movie with touches of adventure.
Entertaining
Quality.
Generic.
It does not offer something that we have not seen before.
It is about a man who is called to take refuge with her family in an army bunker because a comet will fall to the ground destroying everything like dinosaurs.
A good and interesting argument that is put aside just to maintain the sequence of the plot.
As always shows the heroic character who has to save his family.
Most of the effects are well achieved only two or three moments are not.
With very few action sequences, most are more trying to develop the story and wanting to put tension on it.
Sunday to spend the afternoon."
102,"If you like Deep Impact, Amageddon,The day after tomorrow, Towering inferno of the Poseidon Adventure... do not hesitate and go watch this one! Don't expect complex storylines or character development. You love these kind of movies or you hate them.Grab some popcorn and a drink, sit back and enjoy."
103,"This was great fun to watch. And they made the whole meteor hits earth story very believable. So much so that I walked out of the cinema a little disturbed thinking what would I do if that were to happen in real, and could shake off the feeling for a few days.
There are some cliches in there, sure. But they don't ruin the experience. If you love destruction and end of the world type movies, definitely give this a go"
104,"Greenland is a well crafted film, made on, I imagine a modest budget.
A good job done by the whole crew.
Some people hated this film. They sound bitter and don't seem to understand how family life works.
Dad does have a, mahoosive car though.
There were some great little twists and turns in there.
Greenland captures the horrors and lows of humans, what they will do to survive and also the sacrifices, people will make for others. I see moments like this in my life, why not in a film?
The acting is good and the little boy did a fine job. He has done some of the best work in the whole picture, he really came across a scared witless!
I enjoyed the film.
See it for yourselves."
105,"In in very short words:
If you liked these kind of end of the world movies from the 90s, you gonna enjoy this one. The main cast is pretty good and even the smaller roles do a good job. The story is pretty intense and has some nice twists and surprises. Story is a bit predictable und unrealistic at times, but what do you expect? CGI effects range from okay to pretty bad at times, but it doesn't bother too much.Definitely worth a watch. 6.5 out of 10"
106,"Don't quite get the bad reviews, it's a really good movie all around, simplistic as it should be with great acting.Watch it!!!"
107,"I like this movie it's amazing , exciting story , as filmmaker I like the way the movie was shot , good color grading"
108,"It's easy to say this film is derivative (BTW, it's derivative, not cliche), but that's to be expected considering the topic.This film evokes sympathy though certain plot elements are unrealistic. Having said that, other plot elements are seemingly spot on. It's not a fruity apocalyptic film like '2012', or filled with exaggerated CGI like 'The Day After Tomorrow'. The limited special effects don't diminish from the action, and the film will have you on the edge of your seat."
109,"Gerald Butler has been a man that has been in a lot of really bad movies yet despite that I still watch his movies because of his great Scottish accent. Greenland is another disaster movie that stars Gerald Butler. The premise is that ""John Garrity (Gerald Butler), his estranged wife (Morena Baccarin) and their young son (Roger Dale Floyd) embark on a perilous journey to find sanctuary as a planet-killing comet hurtles toward Earth"". Since Gerald Butler movies are mostly a miss, I didn't go into this one with high expectations. Is Greenland terrible like his other disaster movie Geostorm or is this an actual good one?Firstly, I appreciate that this movie takes a serious and more grounded tone and does it well. A fair amount of disaster movies feel really over the top or a bit too cartooney and slapstick like ""2012"". The characters all act like humans and all the interactions feel human which is a breath of fresh air in these type of movies. Another element of this movie that is quite distinct is the heart and kindness within the movie. Apocalyptic movies or TV shows tend to focus on the worst of people but Greenland focuses on the opposite. Albeit there are scenes with the worst of people for sure. A recurring theme in the movie is the act of kindness and while watching this movie in a pandemic (Coronavirus), it's easy to appreciate the good deeds that are shown in the movie. The director (Ric Roman Waugh) and writer (Chris Sparling) show the different ways that people handle this cataclysm including individuals who would just party, riot or remain kind that feels believable. The action scenes with the Earth's destruction do occur in the movie but the human drama is the main focus.Speaking of the action scenes, while rare, are visually spectacular and lead to some stunning and tense moments. For the most part, the CGI is pretty good but it does get really bad and jarring in the third act. Likewise, the cast does a pretty good job. Morena Baccarin gives a good performance as a fiercely loving mother that is desperate to protect her son. Gerald Butler is a lot better in this movie than a lot of his previous movies even though he is still mostly just the gruff-looking dad. Roger Dale Floyd who is the child actor is not unbearable like a fair amount of child actors. All three of them are mostly giving okay performances but every one of them has one moment where their performance shines.When it comes to flaws it is mostly concerning the way the story is progressing. For the movie to last 2 hours, there are a lot of moments where our main characters tend to make jarring decisions. Most of this is concerning the wife who I just feel makes a lot of dumb decisions in this movie. You do have to kind of shut your brain to watch this movie or else you will constantly go question a lot of things. The movie also has some pacing issues in my opinion as at some points it feels like it dragging a bit and slowing the movie. The movie does start to feel a bit long and could have cut 10-15 minutes off the total run time.On that point of characters, they are quite bland. The movie never really delves into the characters that much and instead are more focusing on their situation. This can work such as in ""Dunkirk (2017)"" but for this movie, I feel they should have explored a bit more about our characters. Apart from the dad John who is a structural engineer, I don't know much about the wife Allison and I don't know much about the kid apart from he is diabetic which is the main thing that keeps this movie going for 2 hours. It's slightly difficult to be fully invested in caring about the characters. We also get a revelation near the beginning of the third act that feels irrelevant and if anything makes it more difficult for me to care about the characters.Overall, this is a surprisingly all-right movie from Gerald Butler. It's not the garbage that was Geostorm which is great. With all the gloom that is happening in the real world, this movie provides some mild entertainment with a hopeful message that is maybe something we kind of need at this time. You definitely won't feel like it was the worst 2 hours you spent after watching this movie."
110,"One type of audience that should stay away from this movie, those who feel their intelligence insulted when facing a bombardment of contrivances. Nor is this a movie that will satisfy those who are looking for the standard disaster blockbuster type of entertainment. This one is small-budget stuff, compared with any recent flick in that genre. But, if you lock away your brain in a safety deposit box before you walk into the theatre, there is a chance that you may actually enjoy it, to a degree. I did. In my own case, maybe it was because there are three actors in the cast that I particularly enjoyed watching.I'm sure you can easily mention a few meteor-catastrophe movies. ""Greenland"" is another one. In anticipation of such ""extinction event"" level of crisis, the government has set up in Greenland an underground shelter for selected individuals and their immediate family members to ride this out. The criteria for selection is obvious: people that have skill sets to contribute to the rebuilding of the world. John (Gerard Butler) a construction engineer, is a natural choice, together with wife Allison (Morena Baccarin) and son Nathan (Roger Dale Floyd). The trajectory is their journey to Greenland, with a whole slew of incredulous twist and turns, including the three of them get separated and back together again in Allison's father Dale's (Scott Glenn) house.I am not going to spend any time on the plotline. All the ingredients you see here you would have seen in other movies, and likely better handled there. I enjoyed this movie, as mentioned before, because of three actors (that does not include Butler, sorry).Morena Baccarin is not a household name but would be favy familiar to the very successful TV series ""Homeland"" which completed its 8th season earlier this year. Scott Glenn is one of my favourite evergreen veterans, with 98 acting credits to-date. The third one, which I haven't mentioned yet, is Hope Davis, with 57 acting credits to-date and best remembered, for me, in the TV recent series ""For the people"" which unfortunately has been cancelled after two season. In ""Greenland"" she has only a small part."
111,"Giving this a bad review is just nonsense, the only ones that would do that would be some ""single, party person"" expecting action and terminators.This is a movie about responsibility and the unbelivable and terryfing struggle to fight for your family. Thats it... I was stressed the entire movie, wanted it to end so I could run to my kids and just hold them.This is a really good movie, it is hard to watch because its emotional. Give it a go, it is a good movie and it will leave you with a nasty aftertaste of fear... I need to learn astronomy just to be able to look to the skies and get some knowledge myself."
112,"I came in expecting 2012 levels of schlock, but somehow, someway, 2012 is closer to Melancholia than this thing. I wanted an eye-rollingly test-filled Gerard Butler-dragged flick where comets rain screams and explosions down upon humanity, not an endurance test of how long I can persist watching unlikable characters for the sake of the requisite shots of charred and battered national monuments.If you're going to do a cardboard family plot, disaster filmmakers, please at least make them likable. I'd like to be actively rooting for the characters to survive, not indifferent."
113,"Unfortunately it was only the first act that was worth watching. It seems like they put all of their budget on the first act. Then to the second act with the budget gone and also the script and the tension. The Love drama was cliche and was bad written in to this kind of movie.There were also allt of moments in the second act when in ond Minute they Say ""we need to hurry"" then a minute later they talk about past misstakes to eachother.
No no no
The first act was actually really good but the second act was awful actually."
114,"Wow what a ride, 2 hours of pure intense entertainment, really good movie, it shows both the good and the bad of humanity in times of chaos.
I recommend this movie , must watch for sure."
115,"This was a really great movie! I honestly don't understand why it was rated so low because I thoroughly enjoyed it. Great story line, great acting, action all the way and quite a few times my heart sat in my throat."
116,"The theme & vibe this movie has is just abnormal, i enjoyed it so much i can't recommend it more.. it's so intense and surreal and just realistic at the same time, only con is just a slight meh CGI in a couple of scene's but that's the only thing i can say, i wish it was longer!"
117,"I'm a sucker for a disaster movie so was intrigued to see this movie, its got a more serious/realistic tone to it and reminds me of deep impact with the fight to get away from the incoming disaster. Its better then Butlers Geostorm and I think it is directed well by Ric Roman Waugh. Its on VOD next month and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to sit back relax and watch a decent movie over the holidays."
118,This an intense movie...it's basically deep impact for this age minus the space element. I really liked it though! Don't listen to the negative reviews..watch it for yourself
119,"Avoided all the other genre movie by changing astronomical mesurements for its plot and its believable.
good thrill. it works.
watch it."
120,"I was expecting low budget low quality especially from a Gerald butler movie. Man I was surprised! No cheese over the top Hollywood b.s but a real life reaction to end of world scenario. At times it felt Arthouse with the emotion and camera angles giving the cgi story a backseat. This is how Armageddon and deep impact should have been written.
Weldone to the director!"
121,"I would go as far as saying it is one of the best disaster movies I've seen in years, possibly the last decade. The story is not unique and the plottwists aren't that shocking, but the visuals are great, strong cast with good characters and, last but not least, it's an intense rollercoaster ride from start to finish."
122,"What a waste of time. This movie did start off well, I liked the suspense. But it wore thin when the thriller aspects came only from characters making dumb choices. And no it's not because a comet is coming for earth. All of the panic scenes came backed with really loud music, wow it was annoying."
123,"You can play the classic disaster movie bingo on this movie. You can check every box. Driving in to a traffic jam, getting separated, finding each other, old veteran, being a hero, Americans looting and killing each other, loosing your car, finding abandoned home with running water and a car with keys in the kitchen. Leaving a note to return the car. Finding the last plane etc etc. Only mayor cities seem to survive.What would come next would make a better movie. How to restart civilization after such a disaster."
124,"I like the actors, the story and how it goes. some places could have been better but overall very nice. my only true sadness is not being able to see it in cinema 3d :("
125,"This movie made me cry like no other disaster movie did. It's more of a drama about a family in the midst of chaos trying to find each other than disaster movie.
I enjoyed it. Morena Baccarin is great! And so is Gerard Butler."
126,"From the begging the movie attracting you, good scenario nice role playing.... sometimes during the film you think that is happening in reality, the comet is here.... but... come on Comet Klark? I was hoping for better effects during catastrophe and a better ending more different than other catastrophic action movies!"
127,"I should note that this film focuses more on the good and bad of human nature rather than the ""disaster"" itself. The story is well-written, I get a more realistic feel compared to other disaster movies. Greenland is more than just destruction and chaos happening, it's drama-filled and should I dare say kind of scary. If you're looking for a fun, exciting disaster movie like 2012, then go watch 2012."
128,"This movie effortlessly bridges human emotions, interactions good and bad with science fiction disaster genre. Amazing acting by Gerard like always. I would say that this is one of the best and realitic end of the world movies ever. Definitely a must watch."
129,"An awesome Blockbuster movie. If you haven't seen it yet , I highly recommend that you do."
130,It had the expected story line of a end of the world movie but it's more realistic and I found it to have more suspense. Acting was perfect. CGI not so good.
131,It's a reasonable premise however it fits so many tropes that it becomes tedious. Move on.
132,Great film great story great acting end of the world its how it would be with heart top movie.
133,"Like always with movies about an apocalyptic future you will have positive and negative reviews. The negative reviews from people that are going to cry about the inaccurate things in the plot and positive reviews from people that enjoy this genre without being too picky. Count me in the people that like that kind of stuff. I thought they showed perfectly in what humans would be capable of in case of a cataclysmic natural disaster, but then again there were also things that were unlikely to happen in case of that scenario. It doesn't really matter to me, I just want to be entertained and that's exactly what I got. Non-stop entertainment with good actors and decent CGI's (maybe not perfect but good enough to me). If you like this genre of movies Greenland is certainly worth watching. There are a lot of bad movies in this genre but this one is not one of them."
134,"Love disaster movies and after 2012, The day after tomorrow and more this one is interesting. A couple of different paths for this movie and I loved it from start to the end. Thanks!"
135,"Thank god I didn't get influenced by the low rate . If you like the end of the world kind of movies, you will love this one with some great action, special effects and acting, from start to finish."
136,"I could not help thinking when I saw this movie, that perhaps something similar would happen to earth in the future. Perhaps not exactly like shown in the movie, but something similar. It is not impossible. Who knows what stuff we have in space that will one day hit Earth.
They made this movie in a very realistic way and it felt scary seeing this movie.
Remember the movie ''Contagion'' from 2011. Well fast forward to 2020, something similar happened to earth/us.
It is a scary thought.
Anyhow this movie was great. I enjoyed the story and you never get a boring scene. Gerard Butler Played his role perfectly.
100% you should see this movie!!"
137,"Yanks descend to their roots of babarity, dog eat dog etc. Moral of the story?
Your Life Flashes Before Your Eyes however Banal, BEfore You Die."
138,"Greenland is brutal in the depiction of how humans react in a situation like this. I was really hoping we would not have to endure even more political correctness, as is forced upon us in movie after movie, but sadly there was an abundance here as well: During the familys travel towards salvation they encounter a lot of people: And of course the bad guys are always white men, while the good guys are women and/or non-white. Without this politically correct preaching this movie would have gotten a higher grade."
139,"Those who gave this movie low rating I believe they are Trumps voters, because they have no brain at all!"
140,"This is the 2012 movie done right. We went with quite low expectations, but as there is nothing else left to watch in cinemas, we decided to give it a try. And we actually liked it!It starts with all typical cliches of this genre: family issues, ill kid, forgotten medical kit and etc. But the way it executed, is very subtle with many emotional moments. The ploy actually makes sense, people don't behave stupid, kid is not annoying and there is no over the top CGI with constant last second rescue with zero scratch and no feeling of a real danger. The catastrophe feels real, people feel real and it actually always interesting to follow. The kid did a great performance. The only wish, that the movie would have ended 5 minutes earlier, without the cheesy Hollywood feel good finale, but oh well, this is Hollywood, so it is expected.So in general I would recommend seeing it in cinema."
141,"This is a solid disaster movie that never bores the audience with unexpected twists like whom the government choses, who is allowed on to the rescue planes and a cynical kidnapping. We were looking for an action movie and got it, no doubt!
Why we won't rate this movie top score is because of the unlikely and romantic ending with birds in the sky, the undoubtedly survival of the human race and never ending resources of insulin. Morena Baccarins surreal lip job is also an annoying factor, though she is a good actress it is hard to focus on her acting when the lower part of her face sometimes looks completely anemic."
142,"As a fan of Gerard's movies I was little disappointed as all I saw were cliche scenes. I expected most events of the movie. Also, the story was not very well written. His father in law part was also weak (I didn't like his acting also). I think the acting of the kid and Gerard were good, but the actress was bad. Given that Butler has long history with making fantastic movies, I expected more quality stuff from him."
143,"Clich√©, yes. anything new, no. but u are taking on a ride to experience all the realistic scenarios of what people will do when they are desperate to stay alive."
144,"Well, I am not frequently giving high scores, you can check by clicking my user name, confirming this is a real review as well. The movie is definitely underrated (barely above 6 at the time of this review on November the 15th). I am giving a 10 for several reasons. Most of all, as I said, it is underrated and I hope to raise the final score a bit. This movie is not perfect, but it is very good. It is a disaster movie but it is not a mere copy of existing ones, it has its own flavor. I found that certain periods, although not all of them, are very detailed and highly realistic, especially when it comes to military management. Social psychology has an important place in the movie, not only intra family relations, but general human interactions when confronted to threats to life. Butler has a more developed role than usual, less muscular, more next door guy and this is better. Maybe he can become a more subtle actor ans gain bigger roles √† la Bruce Willis, yet I find it hard to relate to, and he is barely likable, same goes for the rest of the cadt actually. I found the kid annoying, to be honest, way too fragile and whiny even for his age. I suppose this is plausible if he was overprotected, etc. Even though I did not bond with the characters, it was worth following them, quite a thrill. There are spectacular pictures that do not always entail explosions and destructions. I will not spoil, and I will simply say that it builds a frightening atmosphere. Situations can be disturbing to very young viewers. In conclusion, this is a hollywood grade movie, and its two hours are never boring. Try it and make your own opinion. I think the movie deserves at least 7 or even 8."
145,"Best movie this year because there aren't many movies this year but this one was engaging, exciting, enthralling throughout. A very realistic pre apocalyptic movie that wasn't cheesy or over the top.I think it's a movie the whole family will enjoy."
146,Wasn't my choice to watch this as it's not normally my cup of tea however Greenland surprised me in a very good way.Made me sad but grateful for my family and dogs as it made me want to go visit my grandad & if I was in this situation I'd probs just get pissed and cuddle my beagles.Less cliche than these films normally are. More emotional. Great action scenes with the comets and debris.Overall this film exceeded expectations
147,Didn't expect this good acting in a disaster movie. Very important and noticable is the choice of the director to bring up the best in people when the end is near. Certainly different from any disaster movie out there. Both main characters are performing at their best.
148,"Great,Great,Great !!! A VERY good movie....I think Gerard Butler is a Very Fine Actor, especially in this Movie....I loved every minute,Music,CGI,Actors,Plot...Get it,Watch it !!!!!"
149,I honestly enjoyed myself here. It's a typical action movie. Keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole movie.
150,"Come on guys, why so bad ratings?? It is seriously watchable. OK THE MISSING FAMILY PART IS CLICHE but the rest it pretty good."
151,"This was a great movie, well done and not too over the top. Has a good story line and is more realistic compared to some disaster movies.
Acting was good and Gerard Butler was on point, yet again.
Wanna take your mind off Covid-19, give this a shot."
152,"Take a rehash of Deep Impact, but with half its budget and you get a movie that makes you feel cheated if you saw in in theatres. This is disaster pr0n without the disaster.3/4 of the movie is just like watching The Walking Dead. That bad, boring episodes. Then when it comes to the actual disaster..................nothing. I'm serious, it's worse than the first of the new Godzilla movies where the scene would cut away just as the monsters would start fighting.Waste of time, go see Armageddon again."
153,"Wow what a surprise. I had read a few reviews and went into the movie with an open mind. Not your typical disaster movie more true to American style than anything else. But great to see the disaster from a family rather than government plotted storyline.
Great roles played by all The main characters with less stereotypes and more genuine roles as well. Definite movie to add to my library when it comes out on Blueray"
154,"At first I did not relish the idea of watching this film today. Recent attempts at End-of-the-world disaster flicks have been glib and largely big-budget predictable typical Hollywood ventures that fell flat. This is more down to earth (pardon the pun) and personal. As a result it is more gripping. Despite the nods to other films to get it on track and in other parts, it starts with an everyday but relatable tension and maintains it throughout. Continually filled with ""now what?"" moments that feel very real. Very well told and directed, the production was mercifully minimal when necessary but highly effective when it was really needed."
155,"Well booked greet acting, A typical movie presents the meaning of survive"
156,"I will keep this short, the movie is refreshing and exciting, it keeps you on the edge of the seat for 2 hours, characters are intersting and the acting is beautiful, it felt like the 2012 of 2020! I highly recommend.
Where it fell short for me is the stupid decisions characters took around midway, which are necessary to keep the movie going but still noticeable, and of course the annoying, less than average child who is causing way more cliche drama but in general these were really minuscule compared to how good the movie in general was."
157,There is no Leslie Nielsen character in this movie. This is a very human and realistic look at how people would react to the ultimate disaster. Thought provoking! Science fiction is supposed to make you think and feel. This movie succeeds on many levels.
158,"Very entertaining!!! Must watch movie if you like ""The Day After Tomorrow"" type movies. Great acting by everyone."
159,"Amazing absolutely amazing, in the pantheon of great gerrard butler performances, this ranks VERY HIGHLY"
160,"This movie was more emotional than I expected. It's not so much about sci-fi as I thought it would be. It's a good movie about what people are willing to do for the safety of the ones they love.
I was actually surprised on the positive side.
I loved Morena Baccarin's performance, I could feel her characters desperation.
They could actually make a post apocalyptic sequel."
161,"An absolute stunner of an end of days movie. Cinematography, acting, CGI, story, everything was practically perfect.I have not seen a movie that has kept me engaged in every moment, in a long time. Morena Baccarin brought her A game. I felt every pain she felt, and that's what you want in a character, and in a film.Sure there are a couple dips, a few tiny plot issues and maybe a couple lines of dialogue you may not love - but Greenland is one hell of a ride."
162,Good 2020 movie!! Gerard butler is a great actor. The movie was good to watch!!
163,"Went in not expecting anything really but it was a fun movie. Not over the top, CGI used moderately and when needed, not boring and overly pathetic. No American heroes saving the planet yet again, just focusing on a human aspect of the catastrophy."
164,"To make it short. If you just want to relax and get entertained then give it a shot, totally worth it. If you want something serious then go for something else.
Movie isn't as bad as the reviews are."
165,"Whilst the trailer suggests Greenland could be just another big, stupid Hollywood disaster flick, it's not. It's a very finely balanced mix of popcorn, family drama (with some genuinely emotional scenes) and enough explosions and apocalyptic sequences to keep fans of 2012 and Armageddon happy. The trailer is also misleading - in a good way - regarding the story structure, which pans out in an unexpected but logical direction and is well paced throughout.
Good performances, good production, good everything. This is the best film Gerard Butler has done in a while."
166,"There a lot of movies dealing with the world (possibly) coming to an end. Most of this movies focus on the type of destructions, or on heroes, who do the impossible and save humanity from whatever is coming. Of course all of them will have some kind of human interaction included in their storyline. Love is a key aspect to an ordinary screenplay. So what is then so special about this movie?It is an emotional rollercoaster drive. It digs deep into human nature. Not only scratches it on the surface of what human beings could be capable of, when the world would face such an disaster, but it drills inside, you can actually feel it. You can actually understand, what such a scenario would really mean. It was the first time I was watching an world-ending scenario movie, where I actually believed everything I was given on screen. For me that is absolutely unique, and as I learned from TENET's reviews on this and other platforms; you cannot rely on the publics opinion, when it comes to your own taste.Whrever you live, if theatres are open, do yourself a favor and go watch this incredible piece in a cinema. Far away from distractions, that video on demand comes along with. Never forget: When you subcoinsciously know, you can pause a movie, you won't get sucked into the plot as you would be, when you're in a theatre.Have fun."
167,"This movie is absolutely great! Wow!
I think it gives a good insight in how people will react in a crisis.
And I am a fan of well made disaster movies :) This goes in my book as one of the greatest disaster movies.
Of course there is a happy ending, but I can live with that."
168,Always love a good disaster movie with gerlad butler but this is quite different to the usual over the top disaster films it hits a very realistic take on what an natural disaster could look like with emotional scenes throughout really worth a watch
169,"This movie was great. Good acting and a cool story. I hate most movies, but would recommend this."
170,A easy film with a predetermined course. Had a good time spending a few hours in cinema. Don't expect a good movie.
171,"If you enjoy disaster movies that focus more on the plausible, then this is a movie for you. It's not exactly a ""good movie"" but sometimes you just want to see a movie like this. It has a pretty interesting plot, but the movie feels very long. The acting is pretty good, many aspects seem believable and realistic while other smaller parts are nonsensical just done just for the sake of extending the movie or adding an action to the scene. This movie has so many weird twists and turns but it's alright. I can understand why some people might not enjoy it so much since it is a drama, a lot of talking and slow scenes and predictable plot but some people enjoy that. So I think the rating it has by the time of this review 6,5 is pretty accurate. It is a solid 6,5 or 7 out of 10 movie for most people."
172,"I love it! It was emotional roller coaster. The acting was great,the effects were awesome, it was pretty realistic and made me cry a few times! Bravo!"
173,"The characters act like real people, there is consistency of plot, it's not overly improbable. All very strange things to say about a disaster film!"
174,"Don't mind the bad reviews/low ratings,it's up there with the best end of the world movies I've seen."
175,Great story and great tutorial for authorities to prepare for such a disaster and how to use technology to contact people.
176,Its VERY good!My only problem with The movie is The bad CGI.
177,Seriously? Is this the kind of movie Hollywood is producing right now? Man..I got to tell you Hollywood is really in need of creative scriptwriters now. All there right now are just pretenders.
178,"Too bad most of the movie was shot with a handheld camera, the picture bounces around making it nauseating to watch, such a waste."
179,"The idea is good but the followthrough is awful.I really like this kind of movies but I think there's some bad writing and especially bad directing of actors, making this not a complete flop but just fall short from ok.bad CGI at some points (like the fire in his arm in that scene), the rhythm is strange and for people who are very short on time it looks like they're not in such a hurry as they definitely should be, and one bad decision after another just makes it bad to swallow and keeps you on the edge saying ""no man, don't do that... hurry up, god damn it!!"""
180,"Well done in terms of intensity, atmosphere and setup. Great acting, effects and story telling. I liked it.And to be honest I kinda wanted to be a sad ending but, it all goes well at the end, like most of them :)Good watch. I recommend it."
181,"The movie was belivable and i like it but it could have a better ending, it was too predictble!!!!!"
182,"Director/production - 6;
Story - 5;
Cinematography - 7;
Acting - 5;
Makeup/FX - 7;
Sound - 8;
Music - 6;
Personal motivation - 6;
My average - 6,25After Armageddon and Deep Impact a same story from the point of view of a family. Story wise there some flaws and some scenes not really believable and others somewhat more. FX are ok, but no big of the screen eye candy, what you suspect in this genre."
183,I think the alot of effort was put in and some great actors really did the job. could have liked to see more dissaster after the so called planet killer hit the earth ..but overall i genuinely think hard work was put in from the camera guys to the director kudos i just cant belieave there is someone who just rated this movie 1 .its just not acceptable .i mean you can dislike the movie but a rating of 1 for real . thats why am gonna give it a 9
184,"Do not watch when you are easily irritated by stupid decisions (""I left his medicine in the car"" ""mam, you can not get on that plane"" etc. etc.) and stubborn characters that do not react to warnings when they should.
Or accents that come and go.
Or characters that show & tell strangers their special ""chosen to escape"" bracelets and not expect your kid to be kidnapped, or some Nazis to act out.
It is one clich√© after another.
Yet nice when you have nothing else to watch, with a Coke and a bag of nacho's."
185,"This movie had an overrated trailer (Which convinced fans that it was going to be awesome) but luckily I did not see the trailer and enjoyed the movie as heck! Some people may tell you that they were on the edge of their seat, some would tell you that they completely forgot about the COVID-19 virus for 2 hours and you know what I say? I say that all of this is true.When I watched this movie I was at the edge of the seat and hen the movie ended I actually started thinking of my future. I completely forgot that we had a virus spreading around the world and actually started thinking if this would happen to me. This movie completely changed my mindset for some time and I recommend that you watch it because if you are a human with emotions you will get some kind of a feeling but why am I telling you? You can find out yourself."
186,"If you liked 2012, you'll... maybe like this. More character depth, better acting (if that's what you're after). Less about the actual apocalypse and what's going on from an overall perspective.Pace is slower than 2012, sometimes drags especially when it comes to our boy Gerard B. Interesting character arcs however needs more... 2012 (if that makes sense)."
187,"This isn't a bad movie for a pandemics and depression time. Just look and think that everything could be even worse. But I have one question, why Greenland and not Alaska?"
188,It seems that every US marriage in Hollywood that is at the edge of collapse needs to be saved by apocalypse.
189,"Is this movie about the asteroid or drama???? Can someone tell me? Well if you search something like roland emmerich 2012 movie, do not watch this.. Nothing interesting here."
190,"Unfortunately, I read some of the reviews before I watched the movie. For all you naysayers that want blood, guts, gore & action, this is not that type of movie. This is a movie that shows the different human emotions and responses to a extinction level event. Yes, there are other movies that are similar, but this was a well scripted movie with believable events from humans ranging from selfishness & murder to absolute care, understanding, and generosity.
Not all movies have to be bang bang shoot them up. Overall this is a very good movie that's enjoyable and each person will take something different out of this movie about how humans react when A cataclysmic event happens. I
Enjoyed the movie, I hope you do too."
191,"Loved it! Thrill, joy, tears, excitment, you name it, all of the emotions packed in one single movie! This is exactly how a movie should be filmed, with action and excitement in every scene. Another thing that I loved was how unpredictable it is, when for other disaster movies you already know the ""usual storyline"" before watching it while here there was something unexpected in each scene. Would love to see more of G. Butler in disaster and action movies!"
192,"Waste of time, silly decision making, implausible ending and he shouldn't have killed 2 people."
193,"This is a B-rate apocalypse movie. It can't come even close to standing side-by-side with a movie like 'The day after Tomorrow' or 'Deep Impact' or 'Twister' due to the incredibly low budget.... the problem is: When you're trying to make an apocalypse movie, you HAVE to have a big budget in order for it to be believable. Other movies like Comedy films or Romantic films don't need a big budget and they can still be excellent, but if you skimp on the budget with an apocalypse movie, then you're 100% of the time gonna end up with a B-rate or C-rate movie... it's just a fact.So... is this movie better (or even close) to 'The day after Tomorrow'? HELL NO! And apart from the fact that the movie has very poor CGI, the movie also suffers from being overly dramatic ie. they wasted over 10minutes of the movie on the 'where's my medicine' scene, and it resulted in 10 straight minutes of me rolling my eyes because I knew exactly what was going to happen next. There's 2 other scenes in the movie like this where they just waste screen-time in an effort to stretch the budget and fill up the movie so that it can reach that golden 90minute mark.I'm afraid that this movie is just too hamstrung by the budget... there's nothing really wrong with the actors, but the budget just destroys any change that this movie had of being good. 5/10 for trying to built false suspense too many times and for having a shoestring budget with bad CGI."
194,"The last movie I watched that made me feel this ill was Cloverfield. Greenland has a lot of hand held camera footage, but it's combined with a lot of action/movement on the screen. I walked out of the movie at the end feeling like I needed to vomit.Worst part: the hand held camera was so unnecessary. Maybe now and then, but not the amount they had.Regardless, the movie was ok. Not in the realm of Deep Impact, Armageddon or even 2012, but it was alright. Probably a 6-star movie without the camera issues."
195,"Im so sad Gerard Bugler is forced to do this kinda movies. I dont know does he struggle with money or gambling but this kinda movie i hope he never do again. Bad mediocre acting followed by unfinished story line with many flows from start to finish. 2012 movie for this is like a Bible. I'm was so pissed walking from cinema giving this movie a hope. Maybe its good for friday family fime but do not , i say again do not go and pay to see this. Im not a hater, as a mather of fact i love this kinda movies. Sadly thats how it is. Sry for english."
196,Some decent actors here but this movie is just crap. The writers just threw a bunch of dumb scenarios together. How do these garbage movies get financed?
197,"Terrible terrible movie. As soon as we know the kid is a diabetic, It was clear to me what the movie is about and how it would revolve and unfold.. It is so full of clich√©s, terrible acting and surprisingly dumb events in time and story, it's even insulting to people who simply want to be entertained by watching a disaster movie on Saturday night. Simply disastrous."
198,"Very poor script, very poor acting...one hilarious and non-logical decision after another, the characters are constantly behaving like low-IQ idiots, and especially the wife and the Carl Sagan-like-child are painful to watch"
199,Mediocre at best....the plot has holes like a swiss cheese....incredibly boring and im speechless .... deep impact was better.
200,"Probably the worst movie of the decade, horrible plot - just copied from anything that had the same theme before, be it movie, cartoon or comics - not 1 original moment in the whole ""film""! horrible acting, so horrible that you want to throw up so many times during this garbage, awful music, cheap production, probably the only expense was the ""actors"" wages... this movie is what we will have to get used to if covid 19 stays with us, cheaply produced garbage with worthless actors. Omg, this is not the world we want."
201,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)This type of movie is always rather divisive between critics and audiences simply due to its nature. Story-wise, it's never groundbreaking or innovative in any shape or form. These apocalyptic films always follow a formulaic screenplay, packed with logical inconsistencies, but also with tons of thrilling action. Visuals vary in quality depending on the studio, as well as sound design and other technical aspects. I always try my best to accept *everything* these movies throw irrationally at the viewer. I prepare myself to be as open-minded as I can, and usually, I have no issues with that (actually, I find the ""that's not how science works"" argument a bit nitpicky in this subgenre).However, Greenland fails to deliver the only thing I did expect from it: a planet-killer comet of pure popcorn entertainment. The only positive aspects are the cast and two/three sequences genuinely exciting. Gerard Butler is already used to this sort of film (Has Fallen series, Geostorm), so he has no problems in portraying another thin character with no real motivations or depth. Same goes for Morena Baccarin, who simply plays the wife of Butler. Both deliver good performances, enough to keep me engaged until the end of the flick.The few good sequences are really good. Little scraps of the giant comet hit Earth before the extinction-level event, and these look great. Nevertheless, just this for a 119-minute runtime is far from being satisfying. As expected, Chris Sparling's screenplay is as generic as it could be, just like Ric Roman Waugh's direction, which doesn't really offer anything remotely new. Some narrative decisions (not related to science or technology because these I just accepted as part of the usual illogical stuff) are definitely to pass the time since they have no consequences whatsoever. Greenland is precisely like dozens of other movies in the subgenre, but without the technical aspects that end up elevating the overall picture.The VFX look dated in some sequences, almost like they didn't have enough time (or money) to finish them. I mean, a static image of a meteorite shower as the sky? Really? Sadly, this comes across as amateur and lazy. The absence of a powerful score (David Buckley) makes the action scenes feel ""empty"", like something is missing. A few fighting moments are pretty much impossible to see clearly due to the overly dark environment and choppy editing (Gabriel Fleming). Overall, the action walks the line between decent and terrible.However, the most significant ""slap in the face"" is the planet-killer comet that everyone is going to look forward to as soon as they enter the theater. There's no way of working around this: if an entire film builds up a third act's massive comet of the side of Europe, it must show it hit the ground in all of its splendor. The gigantic explosion of ridiculous proportions, the endless smoke that fills up the whole atmosphere, the distinctive sound of the impact... This is the moment that can make or break any apocalyptic movie. Unfortunately, and I'm only going to write this, it broke.In the end, Greenland is predictably underwhelming, packing only a couple of genuinely exciting sequences, and a decent cast. Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin try, but they're not enough to compensate for everything else. As expected, Chris Sparling's formulaic screenplay doesn't add a unique storyline or innovative aspect to the genre, as well as Ric Roman Waugh's basic direction. This would all be fine if the action delivered what most people want to see, but sadly, this component is also quite a letdown. Despite a few occasional, riveting scenes, the entertainment levels are pretty low due to the unimpressive visual effects, lack of a powerful score, and poor editing, culminating in a ""viewing-killer"" disappointment. If you absolutely love apocalyptic films, maybe you'll find something enjoyable about it that I didn't. However, if this type of movie doesn't suit your preferences, then this one surely isn't going to convert you.Rating: D+"
202,"If it is not Guy Ritchie who directs Butler, then it's not worth mentioning G Butler at all -- unless one focuses on the potential that movie could have had"
203,"Basic premise failure: if you can't predict where the pieces of the comet are going to impact with any accuracy, then it makes the most sense to stay put rather than bug out. The stupidity of the premise is outdone by the stupidity of the main characters and the cliches layered on top of cliches. I"
204,"Emmerich has run out of ideas and we're left with a much worse copy of his 10 yrs old ""2012"" cgi is of course better but- this truly sucks."
205,"I took the Missy with me knowing that it would be the last day that this new release would be on the biggest screen in the cinema. I kept telling her that she was gonna love this movie. I was so embarrassed after the movie.There's hardly any CGI, which I was hoping for except for 1 scene where there's debri of a meteor falling onto cars. I could count on my 1 hand the amount of special effects there were. I was so disappointed with this movie I just had to warn my fellow movie goers. Rather watch this less than mediocre movie at home, don't waste your time and money going to the cinema's.Mother loses husband, then decides, hey let's trek across the country to my dad, knowing he has the insulin for her son who's with her. Knowing that there's a huge chance that he'll come back to the car looking for them, and leaves a small note by the car which anyone could've just taken. There's a long night scene of shaky camera, where I struggled to actually see what the hell was happening, hoping that it could be daylight again. I just wanted this movie to end to put me out of my misery."
206,"Do not expect the usual disaster movie full of explosions and VFX. It focuses more on the Garrity family, and their quest to reach the safety in the government bunker, before the world ends. The family during their survival journey will encounter many difficulties. Greenland tries to be a different movie on the genre, and I appreciate when a director take a different approach, considering also that most of these apocalypse movie are very similar.Characters are very flat, there is no development. The wife, Allison is really annoying and I think that she cries 80% of the time, Gerard Butler tried to do his best, but unfortunately he could not deliver a convincing performance. Maybe the most convincing actor was Roger Dave Floyd playing the kid. There are a lot of boring and uninspired dialogues, that serves to increase the runtime. If they wanted to do a really different thing, they should have focus more on the human side of the family, showing more complex emotions, adding maybe a few tension moments here and there. The problem with Greenland is that it wants to take a different approach from the rest of these disaster movies, but at the same time wants to be one of those Hollywood blockbuster, so at the end I did not really understand the who this movie was made for. For sure not for people that loves apocalypse movies, there is not enough action, but is not either for people that would like to watch something deeper, because there isn't one single interesting dialogue or character.I personally don't recommend this movie, it seems that screenwriters and the director did not even try to do a good product."
207,"I love this kind of movies: extinction, alien invasion and all sorts of end of the world-heroic saviors-human action and drama movies. This movie is just ok, it doesn't reach the level of the 90's and early 2020's films. Armageddon, Deep Impact, Independence Day. It seems they don't make them like that anymore. Say all you want about American action heroes and their topics, those movies were something special and memorable. Greenland is a very forgettable story that could have been waaaaay better."
208,It was interesting the whole time i never got bored while watching it
209,"Corny acting. Corny plot. I can't believe that I watched this crock.
Gerard must be hard up to put his name to this.
Amateurish plot and poorly executed."
210,"Total time waste. 1. Its like an emotional roller coaster. Everyone is either getting seperated or some other silly tragedies. 2. Wherever the main characters go, something drops close to them. They are cursed man!"
211,"This movie should've had a warning label, for viewers five years and under."
212,"I've seen more action in a daytime Lifetime movie. And why would it be a good idea to combine marital problems with the end of the world? If the world is ending tomorrow, i'm pretty sure that relationship issues would be one of the last things on peoples minds, yet they made it into a prominent part of this movie. So silly."
213,In one word boring in two words childishly boring. Content is lacking with usual story line. Going from one situation to the next in a really unrealistic way. If you are a teenager maybe you will enjoy this movie.
214,This movie is predictable n unbelievable in so many ways. It should be a comedy. Actually no it'd still stink!!
215,"The enjoyment of this flick would depend totally upon a) one's IQ or b) disposition (that's less permanent, ha ha). If you prefer (or in the mood to) watch a work of art that tells a story of a comet about to hit the Earth, see Melancholia. Should you just want to kill a couple of precious hours of your life, opt for Greenland. Sometimes it's OK to watch something unpretentious and lowbrow, just don't make it a habit."
216,"I was really quite looking forward to seeing this, as it was supposed to be thrilling.....After 40 minutes in, I turned it off, its all very predictable, from the sick kid leaving his meds in the car, to them getting separated, to the fuel spill, sorry but its just predictably the same as most other disaster films."
217,"Things I've learned from this movie are;
Abandoning your parents is OK.Having a decent education and job saves your life.You deserve to die if you are poor and uneducated.Your family is the most important. Families of other people are worthless."
218,"Usual story revolving around a small family. Not much visual effects. I was expecting some visuals like movie 2012. 3 stars just for acting and lesson they are trying to give, moreover some useful instruction incase of any disaster."
219,"Better than I expected, not just a loud blockbuster movie."
220,"Okay this is a great example of the type of movie that doesn't have to be ""good"" for me to enjoy it. i like disaster action movies, but this one is very different from the ones i've seen. it comes from space!! very cool, very anxiety-inducing, and just generally a good time.but that is all. and it's all cliche."
221,"I've seen this so many times over the years - white American saves family from certain death and save the world.When the Hero has to rush back to get the son's life saving drugs from the car, which they gave to the son to look after and of course he dropped as he was petrified, through crowds of screaming people trying to save themselves, that was it for me.If they want a script that isn't 100 years old, let me know."
222,Another manufactured emotional rollercoaster. Everything goes wrong and everyone makes every possible dumb decision to heighten the artificial conflict.
223,"The comet stuff, the way the world reacts and the special effects are great. I was really on the edge of my seat because it was really believable, all of it. I love disaster movies like Deep Impact and Armageddon but this is the first one that was realistic, in my opinion.That said, you get people who just make one bad decision after another. It's like the zombie movies where people do this. You're screaming at the screen ""why? why?"" It's super annoying. And the maudlin ""I love you son"" every time they're in the same scene, also annoying.I'd love to see a movie like this, that is well done, with people making the decisions that you and I would make in this situation, then create conflict from that. Not from stupid people making stupid decisions.The comet stuff was really great and realistic, I recommend for that alone."
224,"I set my expectations low and still this movie disappointed me. Dumb decision after dumb decision. And also extremely biased casting on the ""good guys and the bad guys"". Subliminal wokeness. Lets make sure every person of this race is a helping hand hero good guy, and for the select evil characters we must make sure they are that race. NO exceptions on this part except for the main hero who's solely cast to lure a big audience to this disaster of a disastermovie"
225,"Wanted to see this as it sounded really good, but its so disappointing. One poor choice after another, clich√©, and slow. Terrible actually"
226,"One stupid moment after another. Watchable, but if the choice is this or another movie. Go with the other."
227,"It starts so good! And then it devolves into a broken marriage reconnecting.Oh and the dinosaur killer asteroid that caused an ice age - thousands of years! Blacked out the sun! Bigger one hit, atmosphere cleared up in NINE MONTHS. Are you kidding?Also they went into the cave with maybe a month of insulin. 9 months later. Kids still good."
228,"I had the total lack of pleasure of watching this last night at a neighbours ... Its like a woman's hour made for tv disaster movie ... Its mostly cars and motorways and roadblocks ... I think literally all the effects shots are in the trailer ... And they are all just copies of stuff from 2012 ... A film without the best reputation itself, but I think its a great entertaining over the top comedy ... This thing is more like drowning is syrup ... Hideously shmaltzy manipulative storytelling ... A family drama in a crisis ... And it fails terribly ...I couldn't wait for it to end ... Gerard Butler is a limited actor and this highlites all his limitations ... Its basically everything that's wrong with Hollywood today ... Why redo things that have been done so much better before ... There is absolutely no reason for this thing to resist ... It doesn't have one new idea or shot that can justify its existence ... And some it is just cringeworthy ... Do yourself a favour and do something else with your 2 hours cos this is painful outmoded trash"
229,"Something just like 2012
visual effects are OK.
I like the doomsday, but not like this."
230,"There's too many things that just defy basic social interaction amongst people to go into here: 1 of 10Some special effects really cool, most are not: 4 of 10Kid was rightfully rejected, not for being a diabetic, but because of his total lack of critical thinking skills, and as well you can put his parents in there. Government in charge of saving the world realism: 2 of 10Clarke was seen to be closer than the moon, given scale to airplanes flying in foreground, and they are just alerting people of impact and you've been selected, surprise! Well just some thumbnail math for it to be moving at extinction speed would say they had about 2 hours TKTAG. Realistic physics: 1 of 10.News media broadcasting their doom and all communications for TV are still up and running, they even announce on radio you have seconds to seek shelter from molten meteor showering down, again that slow-as-molasses comet, gave only seconds warning notice, and the dutiful media there to help out instead of getting their families and themselves to shelter. Just idiotic: 1 of 10In general, if you need something to hurl sarcasm at the screen with friends then this is it: 10 of 10."
231,"Sad to say, this brought nothing new to the table. Actually I felt like it brought less than a few other movies in the same category. It's the same ingredients as all the other disaster movies. It's too simple and annoying all the time. I didn't have a lot of fun watching it. Me and my friends watching it, felt the same. BIG letdown.I love Gerard Butler, I see all his movie. And I will continue too. But this delivered too little of what was promised. But, you might like it. Give it a go.5/10"
232,"It wasnt bad but needed more disaster parts, here it was more drama with dis. bits. the moment they said kid is diabetic i knew there will be some subplot problem with it (cliche f boring). so 9 months and its over, sun is back etc? pretty sure u wont be able to see even a glimpse of sun for few years. and since they didnt take ill ppl, where they find insuline 4 kid 4 9 months?
anyway decent warch especially with Morena..."
233,"End of the world movies. We went to the cinema expecting bad and we got worse. As a person who always wants to see the next EOTW movie, I have seen all of the cliches and this one had them all. Let¬¥s start with the yet again white, rich family (all though the woman is Brazilian) with the broken marriage and a kid with an illness, diabetes (it¬¥s always diabetes). The diabetes fact is given to us straight away, so we both knew immediately what was going to happen with that, and it did. The kid is also smart and well behaved, which is nice but getting kinda boring. Why can¬¥t they represent the morons? The whole cast is tall and skinny, so how about a 150 cm (4""9) person for a change?
The guy is obviously an accidental hero throughout the movie while the woman hangs around with the child and can¬¥t seem to do anything on her own. She will also ask the man idiotic questions to which she should know the answer to, since she¬¥s in the situations herself.
The main character guy (Butler) does stupid heroic acts multiple times during the movie, no doubt playing out the macho man fantasy of the director or screenwriter.
This is a good piece for when you want to waste a couple hours or when you need a movie for a drinking game. Either way wouldn¬¥t pay to see it, but the damage is already done. I will give credit for the fact that the kid was a great actor and for once the world included other continents too. They even mention countries that I guess many Americans don¬¥t have any idea about. All in all made me laugh and cringe, so an evening well spent? See at own risk."
234,Out of 17.6 million for production of movie I think 17million was given to butler.. not worth a watch.
235,"This family should not be cellect from goverment , done too many stupid thing. Grand father bad (very) acting . So borning movie ."
236,"It's a realistic recreation of possible events when a comet hits the Earth. Human relations and human behavior in extreme situations are observed and these are important part of this movie. So, this not just non-stop CGI action what you probably think if you see the movie trailer.
Shame to admit name Morena Baccarin didn't say much to me before, I checked, and she has strong sci-fi background already."
237,"I must say this movie was way better than what I expected. I am afraid it won't succeed as much due to COVID.
But on the other hand it is kind of a good timing. The everyone-for-himself attitude depicted in Greenland is very much what we have seen so far in this crisis.
For a Misanthrop like me a perfect movie."
238,"I liked the movie and I liked the plot, I think the actors did a good job in the movie.
There's two things that bothered me, first of all was the bag and the blanket... they suddenly reappeared, after mother and son reunited... what happened?? Those things were supposed to be in the crazy couples car, where the son was kidnapped.
Second, the characters arrived to Greenland... or was it Greenland? It would be so nice, for once, to show the real landscape of Greenland... even more if the movie is going be called Greenland.."
239,"Watched it tonight, felt like stopping it hald way through. What a stupid movie! So an asteroid is hitting the Earth, if thats not plot enough for you to write a 2h movie on, go back to writting school. They threw in all kinds of stupid ideas for no reason what so ever. People are raiding a pharmacy... okay... but then a bunch of goons start shooting up the place just because... WTF?! A guy gives the wife and the kid a ride north, ends up kidnapping the kid?! How ridiculous is this?! ohhh yeahhh and the kid was diabetic!!!R U Serious?! Its like they had a writers meeting where every idea on how to make it worse made it to the movie!! Ridiculous."
240,"I thought this might me a reasonable movie to watch but was disappointed with it.The story is predictable and just not very interesting at all. The story could have been told in half the time, and many of the events were just so far fetched as to be stupid. More like a low level B movie.One to miss."
241,This is a family drama with a little bit of action thrown in to disguise it as a disaster movie. It's about 45 minutes too long and the story is quite boring considering the subject matter.
242,"A total disappointment . That's the least to say in a supposed better , Gerard Butler movie . I feel i was maximum cheated in names once again , and felt bored to death watching a family loosing first their son , then the husband looses the wife and all three end up searching for each other , in a very fractured plot and incomprehensible way , then when my ordeal ended (not theirs), let's search for a lost father !..Frankly , I started betting with family that they'll be lost again , but yes , i was joking .
Finally , when the four meet , kaboom , and I was happy , lol ..
2012 , Armageddon , I was seriously underestimating you , the cliches and the whole things .
I won't talk about the one hundred mess and unsustainable fractures in Greenland cause frankly it ain't worth it . A wasted time .I rated it 4/10 ."
243,"I dont often go to cinemas, but do enjoy big action disaster
movies on the big screen , unfortunately this was not it!!"
244,"Amazing film, liked it a lot. I was wondered when discovered, that budget of this film is so low (if we are talking about disaster films which are full of effects), because it doesn't look like cheap film at all. Liked almost everything and definitely will watch once again in the nearest future. Highly recommend this film to everyone :)"
245,First time taking the time to write a review... absolutely completely disappointed. ü§ôüèºüôÑ
246,"The film suprised me positively. There are old cliches, but it really is a disaster movie. What were you expecting?The characters are not superhuman, they fumble in fights and are afraid. They also make poor choices. The story is not overexplained.There is no presidents speech (truly rare in disaster movies). They way that society breaks down is totally believable.Ballance between action and story building is good. If they would have left the final ending out I would have given 9/10 stars.Go see this, its a fun ride."

248,"Bad acting and very predictable plot.
Worth the time if you're in a desperado mode.
3.5/10"
249,"I don't expect much about this movie, but I thank God I was able to watch thoroughly. This is one of the best acting performance of Gerard Butler I've ever seen on his films.The storylines was perfect to entertain audiences who are fan on world destruction flicks. The thrill and suspense caught the wildest of my imagination.I don't understand why people thumbs down this movie. It's pretty decent, in fact this is the best movie I've seen in 2020 so far!"
250,"Whole movie revolves around a family that I really couldn't care less about. The start of the movie was promising, but after that it was just cliches and face-palm worthy moments. I ended up skipping through the last half of the movie, and am glad I did.
Nothing interesting or fresh. Waste of good actors."
251,Never seen G. Butler be so indecisive. Very frustrating movie even the wife was yelling at the sceen.
252,"What an awful movie, thanks to the dad a plane full of people die, the son when he was in the truck he could have get off but he did nothing and the mom could tell the truth and they wouldn't have kidnapped her son, thanks to that family a lot a lot of people die and they didn't care, just stupid"
253,"This film is scene for scene world war z minus the zombies. Still a good watch but, mmm."
254,This movie had decent acting. What I fail to understand is why was it important for the father to not give up his band. I mean they were refused in already so what was the issue to just give the people.
255,"I'm always looking for movies that hit you the right way. Growing up, I feel privileged having watched film change from everything being about the actors and superb dialogue (60s movie and before).
...all of this before the amazing special effects that we have today. I enjoyed this movie on many levels. You can care about the characters and can put yourselves in their shoes to emphasize with their pain and stress of each situation they encounter. Yea, could the decisions have been better? Maybe, but can you really tell yourself that you would do ALL the right things. HmmmmThe ""magic"" of Hollywood is also in true fashion with superb effects and sound. This is what I call great entertainment. If you are not able watch this film and ask yourself, 'what would you do' every step of the way, then you just didn't let it grab ahold of you. Go see it again!"
256,"Can be series, can't be movie tgis story.. 4 for Morena normaly 1"
257,"Its not movie about catastrophe , its movie about social behavior. 99% of the movie is focucing on wthat we already know - that peple will always act like morons, idiots and aggresive hordes of sheeps when comes to survival.. 1% of the movie are meteoric scenes and destruction.
So the movie show nothing new in terms of human kind behavior . everything bad about humanity is in this movie.. One hour, thirty you see separated family finding the way back to be together..
So boring , so predictable and so out of the line.."
258,"Just giving it 10/10 cause why the hell not ?
It have good script, proper storyline, best acting performances from great cast, great action stuff, just like when I'm watching all those action films back in the day.. (p/s I'm a teenagers, not that old)
Gerald Butler always giving his best, he's one of my favorite actor.
Overall worth a watch. People who gives bad rating maybe expect an Oscar worthy thing, but this is just a film which you sit back and enjoy.."
259,"I don't understand some of the reviews, I watched this tonight and both me and my partner thought it was brilliant. Very well acted, believable characters and good plot. It had great special effects and well thought out writing. We were on the edge of our seat throughout most of the film. I can't really fault it in any way - even when I try to nit pick. We've all watched a good few of the apocalypse type films by now but I don't think there has been any of this type so it was something different. Would recommend to friends and family. Well worth a watch."
260,"They could have done more with him, he's an charismatic actor, he could have saved this flop. The messages this movie tries to send are wrong and insults one's intelligence. Gerard was tired, his lines were the same, some old over used quotes, made this movie lose credibility, some romance misplaced, some funny memories utterly out of place. Portraying some dysfunctional family that comes together in difficult times, didn't sell it. But they made it, while the normal families didn't. Rebecca is still gorgeous but not enough to save this flop. At some point I wished that they all failed, but even that expectation wasn't matched."
261,I just watched a 2-hour film about crying...sprinkled with a few scenes about asteroids! #SoMuchCrying
262,"One good thing is where was that first target choice;) and realistic general public panic with a lot of shooting at each other. otherwise one brain cell generic script and 2d characters. CGI and art work also poor for 2020.
PS if you wonder in case of deadly comet, there will be no selection of program. big shelters that can support large population at least 2 years just don't exist. the small ones that do will house only military personal. PPS plains will not fly with skys filled with ash. and earthquakes can destroy even bunkers"
263,"It was really hard to watch, half the time I was fast forwarding, the beginning was promising but.. not even a good story there, just endless car rides and long goodbyes and that's about it.
Find some better use for 2 hrs!"
264,"Good start and then it got mediocre very fast and to the end. Also their are a lot of just stupid over emotional Karen moments that make you cringe, while the world is going to hell and everyone is in distress one woman thinks that her needs are the most important issues for all involved and see get's somehow always her way. That's just annoying and stupid. Also it is catering the classical cliches of womn. Very disappointing. Also, I would rather face such a crisis in a more orderly country (like Japan) than the US with all that chaos and immediate collapse of sociaty, order and moral at the get go depicted in every movie of this type."
265,If it wasn't for the terrible script writing! Was looking forward to this but found it really boring and korny.
266,"For nearly a decade, Gerard Butler has been involved in many underwhelming actioners. Now, I wouldn't put Greenland in the league of a Geostorm or a London Has Fallen. Because it's definitely not THAT bad. It features a neat performance from the oh-so-lovely Morena Baccarin and some level of suspense in its mid portions. The plot is once again about a family trying to beat the apocalyptic odds (this time due to a large comet named Clarke: what the hell, NASA!) and get to a ""safe place"". The characterization is quite generic; there's nothing that makes John Garrity (Butler) a memorable person other than the fact that he's a structural engineer (and so, the world needs him post-apocalypse).The bigger question in a film like Greenland should be how well the action and the disintegration of the Earth are crafted. Well, the CGI ranges from crappy to decent - Greenland's relatively low budget (for a disaster film) becomes evident at times. The better portions are when the family gets separated and as viewers, we start pondering over the probabilities of their eventual reunion. Ric Roman Waugh's filmography is mixed: a watchable actioner like Snitch, a couple of gems in Felon and Shotcaller, and a half-arsed Angel Has Fallen. What becomes obvious here is that the storytelling in his films is (a lot) better when he writes his own scripts.Chris Sparling's screenplay loses all of its suspense in the third and final act and ends up telling a story that we've heard a zillion times before. If you've got 2 hours to kill, Greenland could work but keep that bar of expectations pretty low."
267,Of course it has all the typical tropes of a world ending movie. The most annoying thing however is butlers change of accents lol
268,"If you're looking for a tense, edge of your seat film... This ticks the boxes üëçüèª"
269,"...a disaster!I was a teen at the height of the disaster movie trend. ""The Towering Inferno"", ""Poseidon Adventure, all the ""Airport"" films, etc. While each had its human drama they also had plenty of disaster! Even moving a few decades up with ""Deep Impact"" and ""Armageddon"" we got a pay off of great special effects, cities being destroyed, etc.This film gave us none of that but the human drama on steroids. Sure some explosions, but they were quick, on TV, or less than spectacular.The very end was absurd. High School students know that after such a cataclysmic event the earth would take hundreds of years for earth to recover. Be it a comet, asteroid, or our own nuclear stupidity, the atmosphere for ages afterward would be poison, the sun blocked out, and well... just a whole lot of dead stuff. Showing the people in the shelter emerging to sunshine and clean air NINE MONTHS after impact was just plain old movie stupidity.When the shelter doors opened, if they still functioned, only the descendants of the people saved would emerge.About the shelter... pretty much it is known that new better designed and better equipped shelters exist these days. Some I have read about are like mini-cities! They have recycle water\air\waste facilities, botanic gardens to grow food, etc. They are designed to outlast the effects of nuclear or celestial disaster after effects. An old cold war bunker in Greenland would not be.On the plus side the actors were all good in their roles."
270,"This movie is an example of no frills storytelling, there are no super space ships ( Deep Impact/Armageddon) or magic Earth subway trains (The Core) to save the day, this is a story of how humans confront catastrophic natural disasters in their own individual ways, and the continuing theme is to never give up. As I read some of the negative reviews proclaiming Greenland unbelievable, when I saw the movie ""Contagion"" I saw many reviews saying that was unbelievable as well, yet when the Covid 19 pandemic happened , suddenly people changed their minds because they saw it with their own eyes. Greenland is successful storytelling of the strength of will."
271,"""Greenland"" is a soft disaster film, the characters are unrealistic, the cinematography is conventional, the special effects are fine, the script could be better. Not a masterpiece, just a watchable flick similar to ""2012"" (2009). There is a lot of better disaster films!"
272,"I for one appreciate this take on a disaster film, focusing on a family and their quite reasonable struggles to stay alive. It's down to earth and enjoyable. At times, at least.Some cast members are quite awful though, including two thirds of the main cast. Only Butler pull through - although, to be fair, it's not his best effort either.Sadly, part of the writing is pretty lackluster too. Hints are much to obvious and characters make stupid choices for no other reason than to set up supposedly tense scenes.Still, worth a watch if found in the three for ten department."
273,"Got to admit, I was expecting it to be a disaster, but this was a lot better than some annihilation movies. The acting was okay, the script, fairly predictable, the effects weren't that bad. This movie is not nearly as good as 'Deep Impact', but was a good way to spend 2 hours."
274,"Engrossing and nail-bitting; ""Greenland"" is surprisingly entertaining and makes a huge impact (pun intended).In this disaster film, a family fights for survival as a planet-killing comet races to Earth.If you think this is just another disaster flick, think again. ""Greenland"" keeps the tension rising scene after scene and features a really good performance from Gerard Butler. Some of the scenes even feel like you're watching a zombie film and makes you want to yell at your screen. Of course the film has some blockbuster clich√©s but all around it's a great time and I promise you won't be disappointed.Follow @snobmedia for more reviews!"
275,"Check it out, it's suspenseful & holds one's attention throughout."
276,"John Garrity (Gerard Butler) is a structural engineer in Atlanta, Georgia. His marriage with Allison (Morena Baccarin) is troubled and their son Nathan is diabetic. A comet is coming. John gets a Presidential evacuation order as a part of a select group.There is a section in the middle where the movie finds its mojo and becomes quite compelling. The problem lies in the beginning and in the last section. In the beginning, the people are too sanguine about the comet. Even with the smallest of chances, the news would play up the doomsday scenario. Apparently, there is a government secret program if not a worldwide conspiracy to keep the impending devastation a secret. There is no way that such a big danger be kept secret for long. John could have told his friends to do certain things. I would have told them to gather all the food and essentials, then find the closest deep mine or cave system. It's not all bad but there are problems with the calibrations. These people are doing too many dumb stuff. The middle is the best when the family gets separate. I think they stumbled onto a compelling theme of the story. When things start going badly, they get more worried about being separated. That's the emotional heart which leads me to conclude that the climax should be them reuniting. The problem isn't the end of the world. The problem is losing each other. So the whole last section becomes anti-climatic despite having some pretty good thrilling meteor shower action. It's not like it makes any sense anyways. The last section is a lot of non-sense."
277,"In my opinion..There weren't a lot of action scenes. But every scene gives chills and curiosity to watch. Especially like the scenes at that airport.,,,,,,,,,,,,,Few felt the feeling of 2012 or world war z type of survival vibes, that Suddenly a disaster is going to happen in this world. That panic..preparation moments. Even tho It's not even 50% it come close with those movies tht i mentioned. but similarity of somewhere. And showing the love and importance of the family in between. Definitely worth watch! :) as most of them said.. one of good film in 2020. btw Sry for ma bad eng :("
278,"""Greenland"" is based on a disaster cliche so old its offspring put it in a retirement home.So what's on offer? Formulaic working Joe who's doing better than average Joe's has a nice formulaic wife and family. Of course he loves them so much he has a Hallmark style photo is on his phone. He lives a formulaic life in the burbs but has had a few predictable personal problems with his better half. That's all disrupted by a nasty, inconvenient, formulaic extinction level disaster event.Yet, in spite of the fact he's presented as a working stiff, he and his family are ""special"". Their special bacon is, in fact, so postcard perfect, its to be plucked from the terrified ""expendable"" mob, that is humanity. If only they can get their entitled selves to Greenland.Thus starts a well choreographed, competently directed, special effects laden disaster romp that looks like every other disaster romp we have seen. It might not be boring if you are new to disaster flicks. If however, you have been around a few decades, its tired fare, that offers nothing terribly new or fresh. It also pushes the notion that we are all equal, whilst showing, quite clearly, we are not.5/10 from me."
279,"Chronicles of the problems people get into just for can't help talking so much,"
280,"The acting was good, too good at some points. Some minor plots were predictable but done well and realistic.
It's a bit frustrating watching one man bully so much to survive though. It's no wonder the US is where they are in this current time of covid.
The visuals are stunning! If you have a lazy afternoon to watch an end of the world movie with little commitment, it's ok."
281,This movie was extremely entertaining with good acting.I saw Let Him Go yesterday and it has a 7.1 on IMDB! This movie blows that Let Him Go out of the water. There is no comparison.
282,"I didn't think women in Scotland wore kilts - that it was only a male outfit. Oh, well, perhaps it's a non-consequential goof.All the jerky camera movement gets annoying after a while."
283,15 hours for the end of the world and people still working on the roads.... wondering if they are getting paid double for that....So many bad decisions everything that just do not make sense. I am giving a 7 because I love the genre and if you can look past the incoherence you can still enjoy it
284,"Movie at start feel intense. You can feel something is coming. It was so intense. Soon, this movie will turn into family struggle to stay together, to stay alive. You will see some beautiful landscapes those will make you feel how beautiful our planet is and now its on verge of destruction. Ending scene is not so satisfying if you take realty in account but its also not like big disappointment. Overall this movie is something you shouldn't miss."
285,"""Greenland"" surprised me positively.
The story and events unfolding isn't surprising though, fairly clich√©.
However, I feel the acting and dialogue is overall good from all involved, Gerard and Morena both decent and not any stubborn, hysterical kids as is otherwise the norm.Isn't as ridiculous as the 2009 movie ""2012"" where whole continental plates flip upside down. ""Greenland"" is much more believeable and all in all, seemed alot more realistic and plausible.There are a few points during the movie that scientifically don't seem right, and a big part is the ending, which doesn't really hold up to science either. However still quite nice. Not so much focus on CGI effects, more on the people and that worked well.
As mentioned the story is a bit of the same with all these disaster-type movies. The main cast constantly runs into obstacles along the way, and some would be expected and also a few times they make poor dicisions, but not nearly as many of one could have feared.Despite the very ending, that I considered the lowpoint of the movie, I will still give it a 7."
286,"Even the world in disaster this movie very good in showing humanity is still exist among us even we have different races,colour or language.. its balance some people turn good into bad.. we have some strict soldier,nice soldier .."
287,"Greenland has just hit cinemas here with everyman action hero Gerard Butler leading the charge.I went into this thinking here we go again, Gerard Butler saves the world, or the President, or the G7. But this is in fact light-years away from being a Greenland Has Fallen, and we're all the better for it.Sure, Greenland is a disaster movie - there's a planet-killing comet called Clark barrelling towards Earth - but this is a much smaller story of Butler's character John, who must do everything he can to try and save his estranged wife and son.The story explores the notion of the human survival instinct more than the end of the world as we know it and it makes for very immersive and often stressful viewing.Deadpool's Morena Baccarin is Hope, and as a woman and mother pushed to the very brink as they face the worst of human nature, she's very compelling. Opposite Butler, they make for an authentically troubled couple who will do anything they need to save their son and themselves.I'm not gonna lie, when I saw the trailer for Greenland I was certain I was in for a pretty much done-by-numbers disaster movie and was so very pleasantly surprised with what I got instead, with a narrative which unfolded in a plausible, convincing way augmented by a kinetic and concise delivery.We are not talking awards-worthy or life-changing, but Greenland really is a great big screen COVID distraction and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
288,"Greenland makes us feel like it is 1998 all over again, when the twin asteroid flicks Armageddon and Deep Impact ruled the box office and crash-landed into pop culture consciousness.But in these unnerving and uncertain times, suddenly the end of the world does not seem so far-fetched after all.After 2017's Geostorm, Gerard Butler takes on yet another global catastrophe alongside his Angel Has Fallen director Ric Roman Waugh in back-to-back projects.But this time, he is a regular guy rather than a superhuman Secret Service agent, and more preoccupied with saving his family than the US president.Greenland opens with an estranged couple, John and Allison Garrity (Butler and Morena Baccarin), whose marriage has imploded and are struggling to co-parent their young son (Roger Dale Floyd).But standard news reports of an impending comet passing Earth quickly escalate into an extinction-level event when the fragments start laying waste to continents and society falls apart.This is one of those conventional race-against-the-clock thrillers jam-packed with classic genre tropes and cliches.Our protagonists embark on perilous and increasingly desperate attempts to seek sanctuary in rumoured bunkers located in Greenland.The Garritys are soon split up amid the pandemonium and run into seemingly impossible hurdles.Those who want to get their money's worth in spectacle should be appeased by the terrifying destruction of a cargo plane transporting select groups of VIPs to safety when the premises are overrun by the have-nots in true zombie fashion.The callous kidnapping of the Garritys' child, separating him from his mother, is also a different kind of nightmare.After two hours, you do end up caring about the characters, even as Greenland showcases the best and worst in humanity and hurtles inevitably towards a predictable conclusion.Its message rings even louder during the Covid-19 crisis, reflecting on who we are as a people and how we can survive a common international threat together.So if you are looking for a sliver of hope - and mass entertainment - amid the gloom, Greenland makes enough of an impact."
289,Lots of movies that dipicts the end of the world have the same storyline. Was this meant to happen in reality. Prepare yourself folks something huge is about to happen soon. This isn't just a movie but an indirect warning.
290,"The movie is so real that I lived it while watching! People's behavior during a cataclysm is presented realistically and decisions made were truly... 85% of the movie you'll watch with your eyes wide open if you truly understand how it is being in state of emergency, knowing that you can't avoid the inevitable. I like how the movie isn't about hero saving the world and it's not filled with boring everyday cliches that you see in every other movie. This is something different that we all needed and I absolutely recommend watching it!"
291,"This film start with a man ""John"" asking by his worker to go home, and John back to his house talking to his wife ""Allison"" scene! As turnout, this film is about John, Allison and their son ""Nathan"" need to escape to a bunker at Greenland to save themselves from the strike of the comet! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the news broadcasting scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the shouting name scene, overuse of the arguing scene, and overuse of the flashbacks scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the action scene also not intense, messy and shaky! Barely intense scene is, myriad of debris from the comet strike at a bunch of people's car on the road! At the end, John, Allison, and Nathan come out from the bunker, after the comet disaster over! That's it! wasting time to watch!"
292,"""Greenland"" actually shows the bigger reality of our existence on this planet, and does it in a realistic way. Without a moment of boredom, and without any notable thing to complain about.
For that alone it deserves the highest mark."
293,"This film feels like it was written by a Millennial only capable of creating characters driven by their own self-absorbed needs, as on countless occasions our protagonists are given the opportunity to help others and yet they do not. Which doesn't exactly make you want to see them survive. In fact, at several points in the film I wished, I prayed even, that a large chunk of comet debris would fall on their heads. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Unfortunately, it didn't. Rather anyone who seemed to show these losers even a ounce of kindness wound up dead."
294,The subject was good but the movie is quite boring... Very predictable and unnecessarily lengthy scenes. Didn't enjoy it much at all.
295,"I gave it a 5 due to the drama bits being soooo long and drawn out. The special effects we're well done but the directing is just a bit lacking, imo. It kept feeling like it wanted to move on but kept getting stuck."
296,The story does not link together. The movie has some seance that are to bloody. and they were not important. I don't know why they had to put some much vaillant!
297,Nothing unique about this film but I like sci fi and I like Gerard Butler so I watched this. I heard an interview with a scientist that I guess consulted on this movie. It's 2020 so anything can happen right ? Lol. A comet is heading toward Earth threatening to destroy all humanity.Dialogue nothing impressive especially the scene between John and his father in law when he is confronted about the marriage and cheating. Thought it was a made for TV movie there for a minute.Morena Bacarrin Gabe a good emotional performance as Johns wife. Trying desperately to protect their diabetic son in the ensuing chaosWorth a watch but I would spend more than 6 or $7 to see it.
298,"I watched it with my kids. My expectations were very low, it pleasantly surprised me. Don't get me wrong, the script is pretty linear, however it plays well on the emotional side."
299,It is hard to find a good catastrophe movie theese days. It was cool to see things normal people would experience in these kind of situations. Little details on the despair of others really made me like this movie. Of course some high-class cinema guru's will crush this movie but it is a damn fine movie for me(a normal person :D).
300,"Gerard Butler was awesome as Leonidas in 300, definitely his best role. Since then he's mainly done disaster style popcorn which are enjoyable if not substantial.This is similar and better than average . Well paced with a believable existential threat.Negs are the unnecessary back story melodrama and the covert woke culture but that is standard across the board for many years.
That the rioting and looting in real present day America is worse than the end of the world America looting in Greenland says some a lot about how crappy a year 2020 has been.Overall well produced and well acted by all if predictable. I got to see it in Asia on the big screen which is the best way to enjoy the sfx . Thumbs up."
301,"Which script was probably written by 12 year olds or imbecils, at least it made me feel like an imbecil."
302,"Finally this actress and in a movie about the end of Earth againüòÅüëå‚úåIt's a good one, really liked it!"
303,I hate everything about these people who think this life is given them! I do not want them to think these people are idiots and are what they saw was
304,Good movie people need two just enjoy a good movie with out being so critical
305,This movie makes you feel so stress. The mother was kind of stupid with her decisions. But dont expect an action movie this was intense and realistic.
306,"For the genre I can not find any flaws, very realistic and great acting."
307,"Yes. The start was decent but... once the idiot kid dropped the meds,
the rest of the ""story"" became painfully clear.
The rest of the movie was ""drama"" pried by the writers with a BIG crowbar. And pliers. And a bulldozer.
I kept watching for Morena Baccarin which is a peach, as usual.Oh, i almost forgot to mention that this movie promotes the NWO propaganda: ""Kids are a burden. Do NOT make them, or, in case of disaster, DISCARD them ASAP, or they'll get you killed.""
My 2 cents."
308,"Solid 7/10 for me. Good special effects, people making crazy decisions which I think you would given the circumstances. Definitely the best film Butler has done in a while. Enjoyable watch"
309,"Greenland is a spectacular doomsday movie, with first class acting (Morena Baccarin was also in Better Call Saul, she's amazing).I really liked this movie because it's not just another catastrophe popcorn drama, the movie doesn't abuse CGI and actually focus on a family that breaks apart because of the chaos caused by the meteors. It's intimate and psychological, much more than you would expect from this movie genre.The separation of the characters create different points of view that come together to tell the story and this structure is well thought.I really felt connected to the characters and the whole thing felt truly intense.
Even if you're not a fan of doomsday movies, you should like this one."
310,"This film deserved a much better reception and a full cinema release. A more human and character focused story than either Armageddon or Deep Impact. Perhaps less visually spectacular, but also more realistic and gritty then any other meteor disaster movie.It's a shame that the creators didn't put a bit more budget and time into the final impact scenes, that could've pushed this film up to a 9 or 10 for me. It was somewhat anti climatic, after such a well written build up, you couldn't help but want more scenes to hammer home the effect of this miles wide monster impacting the world. A few tidal wave scenes and a city being destroyed would've put the icing on this tasty cake of a movie."
311,"As the world is experiencing some apocalyptic events, this movie doesn't bring joy to the viewers.Unnecessary intentional tensions in the story seem to be for heavy dramatic effects which is not necessary and not pleasant to watch.The movie should have just focused on the main plot."
312,"Its a factory of this type of content these days, thin plot is filled with screaming, ""where's my family"", and vague disaster scenario barely fleshed out. So you watch a guy go from place to place as if you should care, a barren framework for some superficial scenes of societal breakdown and disaster fx. Its been done better before, and the nth time you've been on this ride, it just becomes transparently boring, forced attempts at emotion and tension with screaming and loud music, no real exploration of deeper themes, just a spectacle of boring."
313,"Well... it wasn't good movie after all... you know some movie is not good enough well is full woth unecessary dramatic scenes and situations, dull decisions made by characters, dull suspense and a lot of cliche moves... even the cgi wasn't good... they focus on the more ""realistic"" situations in cases like these then fill the movie with a lot of cgi... the acting was ok i think... after all this is one of the Gerard Butler's (who has a lot of entertaining and quality movies) weakest movies...
5/10"
314,"Even though I am not a massive fan of disaster movies, I quite enjoyed this one. I know, I know, we've all seen asteroids / comets about to destroy the world and you have 24/36/48 hours to find shelter / save you family.Its a bit far fetched, its a bit cliched but sometimes that's all you need, its well shot, well acted and I was actually rooting for the family and cared about the characters. Decent effects and well paced, good effort - probably a 7.5 but I will give it the benefit of the doubt."
315,I like the movie very much. 2 hours is just the right during time for this kind of movie. The little boy acting very good. I recommend everyone this movie to watch.
316,"Not your normal "" one man saved the world "" type film but actually quite a well thought out movie and story and, dare I say it, could be believable. Great effects and not too corny. A good, if not very good, disaster film. Well done."
317,"The moment I saw Gerald I knew I wanted this one... Great start, although a long period of the film appeared to be a man struggling to find his family.The plot used in separating John from his family was quite lame I most say, it wasn't natural and didn't make sense...
I love movie where the action is more concentrated at the start, middle and end but in this movie, they saved the best part for the end only.It's deeply a disaster movie though just a man and his family issues caught up in a comet attack....If I had seen more magnificent CGI effects with the characters struggling to break free from the aggressive comet then I would be satisfied. I wanted to see earthquakes, tsunamis and land slides...
But all the same it's a great film to watch"
318,"I enjoyed this film, I thought the acting was good, much better than many half naked disaster movies out there. I really felt some of the emotions of anger & loss, it was very immersive and the 2 hours flew past.The ending was good as well hooray! It could of been amazing, but at least the makers half committed to the original premise of the film and ended it in appropriate satisfactory fashion. A little more thought and they could of really cemented a solid movie, but like I said it was good and that will do.Give it a shot."
319,"A film about an extinction level asteroid event which lead the protagonists and the rest of the humans to search for shelter and the chaos that comes with it.
Film is running with a good pace overall and will keep you on edge. But the script is average, the chaos created is something that you have seen in so many similar movies and the idea is far from novel. Also some of the scenes in there just dot make sense or they feel a bit stupid. Luckily most of the acting is ok, the score and the visuals are ok so it constitutes an ok movie to watch-but don't expect to be blown away with this film. 6/10"
320,"Last of Us music in the background, gives an extra emotional touch, overall end of the world vibes is something that makes this movie special, a must watch on the side."
321,"Just a rehash of all the other comet movies to come out of Hollywood ,except that in this movie I wanted the main actors to die ,,the script made me cringe ,,the acting made me laugh ,another movie like this and Butler will loose his status as an A list star"
322,"I learned two things from this movie of what goes on during an apocalyptic event... ok I lie, I've always known this but this movie makes it abundantly clear:1: If you have a wife, you have a good chance of not making it and dying.
2: If you have a child, you are 100% going to die. The kids in these kind of movies always have some sort of illness too that make them an enormous liability. In that case, just stay home and save other people the trouble of navigating you and accept your fate that you are 100% going to die.Pro tip: If you have 15 hours until the E.L.E. hits but the safe bunker is 14 hours and 45 min drive, it is ok to not drive like a grandma with coke bottles for glasses.Oh yeah, and don't make the 163946582946 stupid decisions the characters make in this movie.Other than that, it was alright"
323,"Gerrard Butler is usually pretty good value. You know what you're getting and this certainly started like any other Butler film. Like able characters (if a bit paper thin) and interesting dynamics and settings.The plot (spoiler free) is about a giant asteroid (and little ones) which are about to hit the world. One of which is a Planet killer. Luckily for Butler his family has been selected to be rescued and taken to a secure location. Of course things go tits up.The film started well. The effects were great and everything was going well. There were some good scenes (showing how nasty humans can be in times of peril) and, again, I was excited for it but...About midway in they seemed to lose interest / money / patience.The plot got stupid. Phones are down until one very lucky first try call to a character... The effects (airplane is all I need to say) are atrocious, even the ""set"" after the effects take place. It's clearly a studio with a lot of scenery painting going on. Frankly, for 2020, it is embarrassing. It's like the effects aren't finished. By now everything has gone off the rails and I actually found myself bored rigid and glad for the ending.A shame because it started so well."
324,I frankly don't know how i should rate this movie. Yes it's an intense doomsday flick but seriously they should have called it iceland. For what it worths once those good people reached greenland it was just shot in Iceland. That won't improve american people sense of geography. Greenland is in no way related to iceland in any form or shape. The last 10 minutes turned out like Emily in paris : you are ignorant public so we will serve you crap. Swallow it and be happy.
325,"Maybe it's just me, but i really think the movie should have been ended when the impact occurred and we saw the flashbacks (it would've been at least a 7.5 stars movie)."
326,"This film really feels like someone accidentally signed off to give one of those mid 2000 asylum/syfy films a larger budget. Unfortunately this budget did nothing to improve the writing or direction.If you have seen a few of those syfy films then you've seen everything that happens here. The cgi is better and the cinematography is fine. Meanwhile Gerard Butlers accent travels around the world and you are left wondering how he got to be in A-list films.It was nice to see Scott Glen in a film as I haven't seen him on screen in about ten years but like everyone else in the film hes given little to do. It also feels padded, like when a film is trying to make the 90 minute mark, only this one is two hours long. The scene where we see someone go from tent to tent to tent to tent to tent to find someone is supposed to be tense but it just becomes laughable.I like a good(or bad) disaster movie but the characters, writing and direction of this are just so plodding and unoriginal that it all feels pointless."
327,"It was an ok movie, but some things didn't make sense. The scientist or NASA or whoever would of known of the comet and real problem and not just alert people right before it hit. They alert the family on the tv, where anyone can see it? The government don't know the kid has diabetes and only turn them away at the last moment? And the should of ended the movie with the flashback and black screen. But they show them opening the door which was stupid because they didn't know what the outside was like. It still could of been no air, on fire and so on. And they had radio communications? Everything on earth was destroyed but radios still work?"
328,Taking into account the level of the movies lately this is close to a masterpiece. Really entertaining and believable. This reallly is scary. Very well done.
329,This movie was disappointing and seemed to have an agenda where black guys are good and white guys evil.
330,"Disaster film. The highly-anticipated movie of the year and one of the best disaster movies! It is strongly influenced by 2012 (2009), but also slightly inspired by Armageddon in terms of source of physical threat. Gerald Butler, after Geostorm, returns in an even better disaster movie. Experienced actor, excellent as always, like his co-stars. Suspense and interest prevail from the beginning of the movie! A long way to survival. Where movie 2012 suffered, Greenland thrives, in convincing interpretations, plot, emotion and suspense, and although it is inferior in effects and scenography compared to 2012, I consider it superior as a film as a whole, without the extreme exaggerations of 2012. The best movie of the year, highly recommended to all fans of the genre!"
331,"If i had to describe movie in one sentence that would be it - spanish - indian soap opera. Only thing missing was freeze shots of one person face then another, than back to first one, then another....From one drama scene to another non stop, till the end, and most importantly highly unrealistic situations even in case of world ends. its like drama scene just for sake of it. its not apocalyptic movie, youll see maybe one or two few seconds scene about meteors, and thats about it. Oh yes, and at the end of the movie, they showing apocalypse and after world, once meteors hit the earth for like another 10 seconds. Cheap soap opera drama that follow family going from one scene to another, kid getting stolen from mum, losing hes insulin medicine, leaving airplane just before take off, phone not working, couple losing each other in crowd, etc, you get idea. Its one big happy ending at the end when they magically meets somehow, and survive. I gave it 4 stars cause of nice shooting, its obvious they put some money into this so not everything is terrible. Acting is just ok, not more not less. I have no idea whats the fuzz about this movie. Just read some news portals instead, play game or do whatever if you wanna kill 2 hours, you wont miss anything here trust me."
332,"Kudos to the FX and CGI people, and for that matter everyone behind the scenes who made the stunning visuals possible. Hard to say how many of those congested highways scenes were real, but if Amazon was involved maybe the producers simply rented miles of freeway and stocked it with hundreds of extras and vehicles.Nevertheless, the story itself is a letdown. Too much heartwarming dialogue, zipping around plot holes the size of impact craters, and Garrity doing heroic stuff that makes little sense given the circumstances.But even extinction-level events have their upsides. I'll keep the above criticisms in mind when I write a screenplay for a possible scenario in 2029 featuring Apophis and the Yarkovsky effect and Tom Cruise."
333,"I love disaster movies!..but Rick Roman must revise himself and his team along with production of course!... what is this?!!!... we are in 2020 and moviemakers are becoming so challenged to make fun movies that can easily be rated a 7?!...the execution is below average... acting is average at best with the exclusion of Morena and Roger Dale... the story is cliche, ok sometimes that happens but then there has to be some astonishing sequenses and FX fo compensate, right?!... but in Greenland there is none!!... i am so frustrated at the downward spiral movie makers are on... much like James Mcteigue, Rick Roman seems to be going down from making fun and very good movies to average and below average ones."
334,"Greenland manages to deliver a very credible portrayal of human nature in the face of danger. It is a raw, tension-filled disaster film that showcases both the good and dark sides of human nature, when everyone knows the end of the world is near.
In the movie when scientists discover that a giant comet is hurtling towards Earth, and that our planet will be destroyed in just 48 hours and Butler is an average man who does everything in his power to get his wife and son to the safety of an emergency shelter in Greenland."
335,"Awesome awesome movie to watch. A family racing against time to get to safety. Gerard Butler doesn't disappoint as usual. Great acting from the cast. A very entertaining movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next.
I love the whole Noah's ark twist to it."
336,"Very well done. Spectacular acting. How beautiful is Morena? Good Lord, comets hit me now! Really loved this movie, yes it does have that cheap Scyfy feel, but its so well done you forget about it. Cried several times, and I rarely do that, but this movie is so family oriented it makes me miss that about movies. I miss realism and love. Fighting for family. God help our country, because it seems a comet invasion is the least of our worries these days if we can't get it together...."
337,Most clich√© film I've ever watched. It's so painful. Please do not waste your time!
338,"One of the most annoying movies ever. Could be great but father, mother and son of the family are making disicions nobody makes in that sitiation. To stupid."
339,Very impressive! This is not just an action film. There are a lot of emotions in this film. A real rarity in this genre. It takes you away. The actors give the whole film the icing on the cake.
340,"Greenland is a pretty entertaining disaster flick. The film is more dramatic than I expected. The characters were well written for the most part, and I liked the family dynamic. The film also tries to go for more of an emotional hook, and surprisingly does it well. Some of the film is dumb if you think about it too much. Also there's one or two plot points that just feel forced to create drama and tension. Overall, I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. The first half is stronger than the second half, but as a whole I liked this well enough."
341,This is a drama about the relationship of loving people in the midst of an apocalypse that will make you cry. Highly recommend!
342,"1. Film was more about ridiculous situations the protagonists got themselves into, so they could be re-united, than an actual disaster movie, so don't watch this expecting Dante's Peak or something similar. Maybe I just came to this movie wanting a bit more 'disaster'.
2. Every time GB broke into a run, I got tired for him
3. I got to the very end and still didn't know what I had watched
4. How could GB move in and out of the safe area at will, when others struggled to get in?
5. The backstory could have just as easily been a zombie apocalypse.
6. If you want a road trip story about a family who just can't seem to help getting split up on their way to an objective, then you'll be ok with this."
343,"Forget the gaping plot holes and silliness we all have been way too much stressed out and serious this whole year might as well just see a fun movie. 2 hours just flew past and i loved every minute of Gerrad Butler cheating death.üòÖ
Don't go in expecting something brainy and you will be entertained"
344,"Nothing to praise about script of acting, just an ordinary disaster movie, not too much beain in it. stil, some messages are held underneath the cliche surface: butler watching tv suddenly turn it off only to see his reflection into black screen which is unbearable because he just kill someone. last image before the tv was off it was an electrical pole which burned the image of a cross. after this he us compulsivly washing his hand to escape from guilt. also radio as some point is saying about third horne from revelation as well butler is passing by a baptist church. even these are not anymore religious marks, but religious cliches, who wants can see in them warnings. one such a warning to remember revelation is welcomed compated with last 99 procents owned by stupid messages of how much people desire to be superhumans and how evil can be good."
345,"Same boring American family apocalypse recycled all over again with zero reference to science and logic... Not even close to sci-fi, just family drama with something random in a background."
346,"But they just had to go for a hollywood ending. They just couldn't let it be. No, sir."
347,It lacks special effects that make your average disaster movie watchable. So what you are left with is a movie with a bad script and lots of characters doing stuff that noone in their right set of mind would do.
348,"Everyone of us enjoys an end of the world thriller just from the genre of the film and specially if it includes a cast like this then it can really turn into something of a legend or keep you at the edge of your seats. Well, Alas, none of these things will happen in this movie. Such a potential cast you are expecting an amazing don't know what will happen next thriller moments but alas your expectations are all run down like a road kill. When writing this story I don't really know what was going through the writers mind but he literally missed on a great opportunity here. This movie should have been made on a real life situation basis how a normal person would react and specially if you are an engineer you would be more proactive in decision making but that's not that the case with this. You are about to board a last flight to be able to get the hell out of the destruction zone and then you see that the medication of your child is gone, never ever trust your kids with these kind of things in the first place keep it with you all essential and vital things and documents because you are the adult here not your kid.The rest I would say it's just a one time movie but really a disappointment specially if you are expecting something like Olympus has Fallen then don't expect anything like that in this one."
349,Good idea. Bad implementation. Terrible terrible terrible script. Mediocre acting. Cheap CGI. I am sending my thoughts and prayers to Mr Butler and the crew.
350,"Expected much more.But it is an ok film:acting is fine,cinematography too,just a bit too much family drama for me...Decent one time watch."
351,"Just a movie with a real hero. A stupid, ignorant and egocentric family, get a call from the government, they are chosen to survive doomsday. Already after 15 minutes they show their ignorance and about 300 people are getting killed at the airport because mommy and daddy did not check their sons medics, but who cares.
The movie is slow and dull, nothing new just the same old sentimental meh."
352,"It's good for what it is. Everything's solid: good acting and composition, the special effects look realistic, it's all good. Very little I could complain about. Normally, I'd give 7 stars, because it's still just a formulaic disaster movie, but these scores are relative, and, right now, there isn't anything better out.So it deserves 8 stars, given the circumstances: if you're looking for a new movie to entertain yourself with for 100 or so minutes, this is about as good as you can hope for."
353,"Thought it was brilliant,2020 but on human emotions and sacrifice"
354,"Gerard Butler is getting the apocalypse as part of his brand. He did the ... Has Fallen series, he played in Geostorm and will play in Afterburn, one could argue that Tale of the Mummy and Reign of Fire were apocalyptic movies as well. And so is Greenland. And it is filled with some of the clichees one would expect from a disaster movie: the average Joe and his family, the dissolution of society, the special effects. Yet this is one of the better ones, as it is well done and has some moments of real tension that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat.Let me list the good things. The acting is good, even the child is not bad. The cause of the disaster is very plausible, if not the exact details of it. The threats are quite real and terrifying. Morena Baccarin is in this. And most of all, this film would have worked just as well without the special effects. It was a good story with well crafted moments. Quite unexpected for a movie in this genre.Bottom line: certainly worth a watch, especially if you watched all those other disaster movies which sucked en gros. This one is good."
355,"Well if a person with diabetes has a very high glucose level you do not give that person food before the insulin starts working to get the glucose level down.
This movie also has a very shaky camera guy with parkinsons. the drama scenes are way too dramatic. Morena Baccarin saves the movie though with her beauty. she is a delight"
356,"One of the best disaster movies of the decade!... if I could cut off the last 2 minutes!It show the true, raw, both good and bad side of humanity.The family get to the bunkers and just as they run in the big one hits. Now I majored in astronomy... this one was definitely gonna end everything! When I saw it on the screen I was like.. ""ok... they are gonna die, bunker or not""... but that wasn't the point. They did everything to be together and give their son a chance! They choose to try because that's what parents do! Absolutely anything! when they were in the bunker and the clock was counting down they held eachother and had all the flashback of all their happy memories together!
I thought that was a good ending personally. Very touching and moving and also cause they made a pretty big point on the size of the comet being bigger than the one that killed the Dinos.
Then it went black... sad but touching! The movie showed everything. The ones who stayed behind and were prepared to die where they wanted to. The ones who tried and tried and even if it was no use they could know they gave their son a chance!Then they started showing cities in ruins... now if my teacher taught me right, that comet they showed up with all amazing effects, would have flattened the bloody place. And 9 months for dust to settle? It took years for the one that killed the Dinos like come on... I know it's a movie but sometimes just keep the facts like you made a point saying it was bigger than the Dino one.... sometimes stick with the first ending... I know we wanna have a hopefully ending sometimes but sometimes I think a different ending just fits a bit better."
357,"I have to agree with some of the lower score reviews that there is nothing new here, every Hollywood disaster movie clich√© is dragged out and there really aren't any surprises. The acting isn't all that great, there are scenes that had me rolling my eyes with the obviousness of it all and some that made me cringe. Yet for all it's faults , this is very well done and most of all exciting. If, like me, you like your disaster films with plenty of disastrous situations, people panicking , running and screaming, then you will enjoy this. It's almost like a great roller coaster ride, you know what's coming since you've been on this ride before, but it doesn't make it any less thrilling. They didn't reinvent the disaster film but this is one of the better ones."
358,"It does it job. Typical end of the world movie. No slow moments. Decent acting. Plot weak at times, but still entertaining if you don't go to watch it with very high expectations."
359,"Pros:
1Explosion looks like real
2 beutuful story
Cons:
1 they talk too much
2 less explosions"
360,"The series of disaster movies we've had over the years are a confusing lot to rate for me. On the one hand, they are remarkably consistent. They are almost never terrible and are always pretty entertaining for the most part. But on the other hand, they all feel very similar and very safe. They follow a template, a template that happens to work, but also a template that has very little risk about it. You know what you're going to get out of these films, that's for sure.'Greenland' proved to be no exception to that rule. I felt like I knew exactly how it was going to end from the moment it began. There are obviously some twists and character turns along the way, but even those never really take you that much off guard.And yet I couldn't hate this movie. In fact I even gave it a slightly above average rating. The movie looks so great and is so well put together that I'm basically happy to have nothing unexpected happen, and just accept it for what it is. Will I be in the theatre when the next one of these movies comes out? Let's be honest - probably."
361,"It was a intense family love saga.
Almost all ""action"" was in the emotional rolercoaster ride the family goes through, and the disaster itself came at a very distant second.
Some cool special effects but like other said here, all the action are in the trailers.
The rest is ""high pulse"" familydrama."
362,We just watched the film and I was really impressed with it. It was much more relatable and realistic than most films in this genre that I have seen. I could really imagine this could happen. It was thrilling to the end and I enjoyed the acting. definitely worth the watch!
363,"Boring, predictable and a carbon copy of the ""2012"" fiasco. Family on the run from global catastrophy barely escaping death and flying away to a safe place from where a chosen few will continue the human race while billions are dead. A happy ending. We are being conditioned to accept their Great Reset thing that to me sounds just like those cheap movie plots with a lot of pathetic hope (and only a few survivors). Just a kind a movie we needed in 2020."
364,"An absolute stunner of an end of days movie. Cinematography, acting, CGI, story, everything was practically perfect.I have not seen a movie that has kept me engaged in every moment, in a long time. Morena Baccarin brought her A game. I felt every pain she felt, and that's what you want in a character, and in a film.Sure there are a couple dips, a few tiny plot issues and maybe a couple lines of dialogue you may not love - but Greenland is one hell of a ride."
365,That's all I can say.. It's a well made movie. Worth a watch!
366,Wow what a bad movie every minute make me angry I'm not recommending this movie and how this movie get 6.4 points?!!!
367,"Gerard Butler was good in the saving the 'President film'. I have also enjoyed his performances in a number of other films. Alas, in this film I did not enjoy his performance or anyone else's. The story is, I would have thought to most reasonable people, preposterous. All goes not too bad until stupid child loses his insulin. Then it goes dramatically downhill form there. Another load of crap written by people who appear to be on a different planet to most of us.A 'B-"" movie at the very best."
368,I like world ending type movies but this one is on another level.The whole time was intense. I was waiting what is going to happen almost through the whole movie. THe story is kinda cliche but it's worth not.
369,"If you're looking for a drama with a sprinkle of natural disaster this is your flick... if you're looking for an action natural disaster flick with science and facts this is definitely not your flick. Too much unnecessary drama, with very little drama about the actual natural disaster which is much more severe! smh"
370,"I am survival movies fan, and really this one is one of the best i watch. I enjoyed it so much watching this with my family. ‚ù§"
371,"This is a tense, sometimes emotional so-called disaster movie.One of the better ones since the last couple of years.Acting is fine, action and drama combined also very good.All leads do a great job and it was cool to see Scott Glenn again.Liked it a lot, try and see it when you're either a fan of Gerard Butler, or a fan of disaster movies with a nice story, emotional as well as exciting."
372,"A decent film, it does not, like so many woke films lately do, try to lecture us and moralise, it's just a decent adventure type film, the only complaint is they shot some of it in the dark, which makes it very hard to tell what is going on, but a lot of films are doing this now and it is annoying."
373,"Basically, this is an updated version of ""When World's Collide"" except with more cars. No, really."
374,Personally i love end of days movies and this is right up there with the best. great acting and a great storyline. if you like that style then you would love this
375,"The chaos scenes are top notched, well directed with all the people running around looked pretty real. The only thing I can't stand is the accent of Gerard Butler. Guy's getting pretty old and fat with wrinkles all over his face. Good acting, but his accent really sucks and out of place in this typical self-important Trumpland, no wonder those rednecks in the truck would ask where he was really from. Morena Baccarin still looks pretty good, her acting is also quite good. Hope Davis just played a minor role in this movie.This movie also showed a lot of ugliness of the American citizens, self-centered, almost everybody is a opportunist. When disaster strikes, they're just like animals. They'd use every opportunity to loot, rob, kill. The only thing that I didn't quite get is the guy who kidnapped a diabetic kid, he simply grabbed the kid from his mother, beat her, kicked her out of the car and drove away. That's not just cruel but also very stupid. A couple had difficult to have children would rather kidnap a diabetic kid? How this stupid guy got insulin during that chaotic time?I didn't finish this movie, but the husband/father and the wife/mother could miraculously find their kidnapped son later, that might can only happen in a Hollywood movie but never in a real world. Again, it's Gerard Butler's accent forced me to stop watching in the middle. Sorry, just couldn't stand it."
376,"Well, this movie essentially does what it says on the packaging. It's a disaster movie.The good points are that the acting was quite believable, effects weren't overdone & the movie did build up tension very well at times.The bad points. Theres a whole storyline about the main characters troubled marriage and the man having an affair (so cliche) which adds nothing to the overall story, nor progresses the narrative & serves only as a redemption arc for the main hero. Ditto for a scene where our hero pulls a person from a burning vehicle while fire rains from the sky and sustains a nasty burn. Then we just.... don't see... the rescued person again. WHAT. WAS. THE. POINT? Again, just comes across as as a redemption act for our adulterous hero and adds nothing.Some of the choices the wider characters make seem unrealistic to me (I couldn't imagine people volunteering to mann army checkpoints while admitting that they are away from their families and humanity will be wiped out in 3 days. I'm not military so maybe I dont know what I'm talking about, but I'd imagine even the most dedicated of soldiers would want to be with their family at this time)Many of the elements of this film ie: extinction level event comet, underground shelters, mention of huge tsunamis (we dont actually see these materialize in the film) harks back to earlier disaster film deep impact, except they did it much better & with far more originalityOverall the film was mildly entertaining & worth a watch if you like the disaster genre - but save yourself some money & wait for the home release."
377,"Gerard Butler, let's admit, is an actor everybody who everyone seems to take frivolously because he has never made anything iconic post-300. I admittedly walked into Greenland expecting it will be like Geostorm again, which was a sci-fi film with a great concept but was ultimately forgettable.I snickered at the fact that how Greenland, the country your geography teacher says looks mistakenly larger on a flat world map than in actuality, has become a safe haven for the apocalypse. I can't help but wonder if Gerard Butler fought all his way to Greenland to find out the shelter have limited space and is left outside to burn due to disproportioned cartography.Well, I stand corrected. I was pleasantly surprised by Greenland. Director Ric Roman Waugh and writer Chris Sparling understand the spectacle of the disaster itself isn't nearly as terrifying as the ugly awful things people would do to each other to survive knowing the world will end. Amidst the impending disaster, the film presents the fabric of society tearing apart and humans turning on each other. As for those Roland Emmerich style panoramic disaster shots, Greenland saves them sparingly for the opportune moments.Another aspect in which Greenland differs from the disaster film conventions is that Gerard Butler's character is not trying to save the world. That is out of his depth. He's just trying to save his family. The story stays with the family and everything else that's happening in the world is delivered sparsely through media outlets.What results is a tense gripping thriller that plays towards one's basic survival instincts that forces the audience to wonder what they would do in these given scenarios. What would you do if you get separated from your family? Could you refuse someone who you knew you couldn't help?Greenland's attempt to break its genre wheel with a character-centric approach reminded me of J.A. Bayona's The Impossible, a disaster film that shares that approach, but with arthouse sensibility. With one foot grounded in the commercial blockbuster sensibility, Greenland doesn't quite land as emotionally impactful as The Impossible, but it is solid experience nonetheless.This is Gerard Butler's best film in a long time and it's unfortunate that it's being released at a time where people can't see it in the cinemas. Most people will catch it on VOD later. If it's safe for you to see Greenland in theaters, I recommend it as a solid matinee."
378,"It is a moving story (it can move you to the edge of your seat). It's uplifting (the main characters major fight is to get high in the air). It's a hot movie (so everyone wants to go to where it's cooler). It has nude stuff (so the best and worst of human nature are exposed). It addresses some of our toughest challenges (traffic jams and no wifi). It's a boost of energy (fireballs everywhere). C'mon, just enjoy the ride!"
379,"I kind of like how it starts out, lots of action and a quick pace. Then in the middle of the movie it kind of slows down and goes into emotional overkill. Then it just gets really bad really quick. I know it sounds funny that a crazy fictional movie becomes unbelievable but it kind of does, it just does not make any sense. And why on earth is this movie called Greenland when Greenland comes no where near it. The Greenland scenes are shot in Iceland and the landscapes in iceland look nothing like the icesheet of Greenland. In the end it felt like a disaster movie turned comedy in the end."
380,"I missed some High ranking military men and a president panicking as they discovered the truth.
And most of all, i missed impacts, distruction and mayhem, especially from the Big one.
There was to few angels. The plot is to Big to only revolve around Gerard Butler and his family, Trying to reach safetyi expected Way more comet action, and just more from this movie in general"
381,"Cliche's everywhere and awful CGI for an modern movie, I was quite emotional troughout the film and the ending had a nice touch to it, if you like disaster movies, its worth a watch, juist dont expect anything special or fancy."
382,This movie needs more rating just for the fact that it is released in 2020 while almost everying is postponed. Loved the movie every bit of it.
383,"Me & my fiancee like this movie & she a dosen't like this kind of movies.
We both like Gerald Butler in the Olympus has fallen franchise & and this movie is worth watching."
384,Really makes you think about life and what you would do if this was to happen gives all kind of emotions off about the world definitely worth a watch i shed a fair few tears watching this
385,"The story line is very good and the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. I basically hate all new releases but I will tell you this: The director did a fantastic job, the ligting, effects, sound etc. all perfect. And the acting is by far some of the best acting I have seen in years. The leading lady was absolutely fantastic and 100% believable and the leading man was also absolutely fantastic.While the movie was above average. The people who made the move and the actors were just simply phenominal. Congratulation to whoever made this flick - great work.PS: Hey Hollywood, learn a lesson from this. You DON'T need to shove teen lesbianism, non-stop sex scenes and 10,000 uses of profanity to make a great film. This film had NONE OF THAT AND STILL KICKED YOUR HOLLYWOOD ASS!"
386,Best film I have ever seen i hope you see this move
387,"It's the worst movie I have seen in 2020, and it's not a movie, it's a running inspiration music video..."
388,"Before WuFlu this movie would have been a 5/10 easily, but since people are just happy with anything that even slightly resembles a movie with a budget, this gets propped up a couple points. It's slow, terribly boring, and there's no payoff. The sad thing is, is that there really isn't much better out there right now, so you're probably going to watch it, and rationalize to yourself that it's better than it really is."
389,"I NOT HERE TO JUDGE BUT THIS MOVIE IS BRILLIANT
THIS MOVIE IS A ROLLER COASTER RIDE FOR THOSE WHO LOVES NERVE
WRECKING SCENES OF DESTRUTION BY NATURE
THIS MOVIE ALSO TELL US SOONER OR LATER THIS CAN BE OUR REALITY !!!
BELIEVE IN HUMANITY IS FORM OF RELIGION JUST LIKE THAT YOU BELIVE IN GOD"
390,It kept me entertained. Some scenes had me at the edge of my seat. A struggle of a family trying against all odds to find safety. The cgi wasn't all bad and the acting was pretty good. A movie showing the best of us and the worst of us and how we behave when the earth as we know it is coming to an end.
391,Actors play - magnificent. Otherwise anti scientific. Plot is basic and without any original ideas. Good for one time watch but nothing more. You will forget it in a few days
392,"Man erwartet heutzutage bei Katastrophenfilmen immer nur coole Bilder und viel Action. Dieser Film ist anders, er taucht sehr tief in die Pers√∂nlichkeiten ein und h√§lt die Kamera mehr auf dem Menschen statt der Katastrophe. Er ist verdammt gut gemacht und ich war echt beeindruckt nach dem Kino, sehr empfehlenswert."
393,"Greenland is another disaster film staring Gerard Butler who after Geostorm showed that he can be watchable in this kind of films.And here he was that,very likeable guy to who we can relate to and root foe him and his family during entire runtime.Rest of cast was also good,Morena Baccharin was also very good and she was even perhaps the best part of a entire film.When we talk about story and quality of movie ,it isnt nothing great or fresh,we saw a films like this one a million of times and i was bored during some scenes cause i already seen them in a different films of same genre ,Greenland is a watchable film if you dont have nothing better to do,but dont expect something great"
394,"Seems that US filmmakers don't know anything about diabetes. Low sugar and using insuline, will kill the human. So there should not be such advices in movies. Unfortunately this is in every movie, where they talk about diabetes, I've seen."
395,Seems realistic to me how a global disaster will unfold . Great acting from familiar faces.
396,"Thought I be bored no guns
But wow grt movie nearly 2hrs drama action etc. And gut wrenching at times"
397,I haven't watched it yet But I am 100% sure that it's Gonna Suck as It has Gerard Butler in it .. May watch to torture myself
398,"Good entertainment, although I'm not sure how realistic it is and found that frustrating at times. Felt that Gerard and Morena are an odd pairing for a married couple, at first I wondered if it was his daughter. The might of the US military is exaggerated, including the dedication of all the military who remained working despite imminent death. Lastly how did their son survive 9 months in a bunker with a months worth of insulin. Despite the lack of realism, it was really entertaining and worth a watch."
399,"Good movie to watch , better then other end of the world movies"
