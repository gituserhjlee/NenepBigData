0,"Is it the most well written, eloquent, well acted series ever? No. Is it a light watch that is easy to check in and out of with fantastic colours and set design/ costumes? Yes. I enjoyed this in a time where I don't want to be reminded of the Covid Global Crisis, politics, the crap weather and other depressing things going on across the globe.The characters are quite fun. The storyline is easy to navigate. The set and colours are beautiful. A lot of criticism around the wardrobe on Vogue Instagram but I thought they were fun and pretty.It's mindless and distracting from reality. Perfect. What more could one want from a series right now?"
1,"This was advertised as Sex and the City (in Paris), but it is nothing of the sort. Lily Collins is a great actor, but her character is basic white girl caricature. Everyone is a caricature. French people are mean and smoke too much. You will just meet your new best friend on a park bench. Every man is hot and going to hit on you. The show was so cringy I couldn't believe what I was watching. It felt like a CW show with a larger budget, then I found out the show was originally set to premiere on MTV. With the toned down language and idealized view of the world, this show is probably great for tween girls who want to put themselves in Emily shoes. This is no Sex and the City."
2,Do Americans realise how they come across when they produce patronising twaddle such as this? Shallow and awful.
3,"Critizing French people for giving 'male gaze' in the ads, while laughing at the age of Brigitte;Every French man thinks about going to the bed with you since you're pretty?Every girl that comes to Paris SHOULD go have sex randomly if they spend time in this most romantic place in the world?French people are conservative, ignorant, insulting foreigners in the face;Finding a Korean actress that does not speak mandarin to perform a Chinese, with bunch of ""american chinese girls"" as her besties;Emily has not made any improvement in her French, nor in her dressing style, from episode 1 till the end. This sucks.I'm not French, but that's definitely not the Paris that I'm living in."
4,"Emily is a late 20/early 30s marketing exec in Chicago. She gets a promotion to Paris for a year, the series is about her adapting to live in Paris.The show seems to rely heavily on clichés and the fetishisation of Paris. Emily demonstrates a level of self consciousness of herself as an American; unsophisticated, uncultured in comparison to her European counterparts. She wants to get that ""je me sais quoi"" from Paris. Edith Wharton would be proud of the use of the America/Europe comparisons in this series.In contrast, all Parisians are depicted as clichés (dare I say offensive ones at that). The older women are relaxed about affairs, impeccably styled and chain smokers. The love interest for Emily is a cultured foodie who could model as a side gig if he really wanted. Her company's client sends her lingerie ""for herself"", so sophisticated is he, that sending creepy gifts is a form of heightened sensuality and sophistication.The tv show borrows tropes from iconic work that have come before it, presenting Audrey Hepburn-esque Lily Collins as the one to deliver many of them. The Miranda priestly style boss in the form of Sophia, the OTT haute couture fashion in a hark back to SATC... etc etc.I wanted to be able to enjoy the show for the escapism that it is, but i feel this show would've benefited from being slightly more grounded, slightly more realistic. The show on surface level seems to pay homage to the city of Paris; indeed many of the characters reference to how wonderful the city is. Emily's large social media following are falling in love with Paris in the way she is supposed to be - yet all we see is a saccharine, sugar coated version. The pastel tints, macaroons and Chanel.Paris is also the city where one of the most significant cultural revolutions in the world took place; the architecture is stunning: it is home to vibrant communities and an artistic history. It isn't just about eating pastries with a Chanel bag.My final gripe is how a 30 year old is able to afford all the high end fashion that Emily has. She works in marketing, not in fashion. Yet she is wearing runway Chanel.This show panders to a fantasy, not steeped in any real appreciation for the city it claims it loves, which is a shame, as the storyline is pretty compelling and the shots of the city are stunning."
5,"The series was promising with great actors and a nice theme.
Unfortunately, the writers clearly never lived in Paris. It's a chain of clichés and stereotypes, each more exaggerated than the next, that makes the series completely absurd and difficult to watch.
So sorry to disappoint but:
lot of Parisians don't smoke ;they don't arrive at 11 am in the office and they actually work during the day ;all men aren't unfaithful ;all Parisians aren't mean.The least we can say is that nuance and subtlety are not present in this series."
6,"I'm French and yes there is lot of clichés in the show, it may be a bit annoying when this is overplayed but to be fair, even if in numbers the cliché are mostly on French, the authors do not avoid to put some on Americans too (shouting instead of talking, not able to dress up without a lack of taste, etc.). Moreover what I found interesting in this show (and apparently my fellow country mans didn't noticed it) is the fact that when there is a cultural difference to settle, this is not a "" Merica is always right so think as we do"". Both are giving their point of view and explain it.Overall, the show is quite nice even if lot of things are not credible, and I would put a 8 stars if clichés were a bit more nuanced (ex: yes we know that there is less working hours/per week than in US but come on, nobody starts a 10:30 AM and take a 2h lunch break at restaurant every day).To conclude, this is not the tv show of the year, but still nice to watch. If you're not French, keep in mind that this is not a true reflection of France, if you say ""bonjour"" we're not that rude ;), and if your French, chill-out a bit, i know we are a proud of being French and very chauvinist but come on, what is showed is somewhat halfway true and keep in mind that authors try to do it in both ways with superficiality on US social media etc..."
7,"Yet another American in Paris who doesn't speak the language and has no intention of bothering to learn it, as if French is merely a few vulgar noises she can spit out while talking a bit louder in English so everyone will understand.Another story about how simply watching TV and movies, and never wandering one step from the script of current popular culture will assure success. She's good at social media? Ugh. Just what the world needs: more brain-dead creeps staring at their phones 24/7. ""I read that book at university...well, part of it,"" she says with no shame to one of her French suitors. She says this in almost the same breath as she admits to having a master's degree in communication. I guess reading wasn't part of her curriculum. Stupid wins!Yet another Hollywood production about how sexy and glamorous it is to be in marketing. Isn't that just selling crap? Hollywood only has two jobs for slobs who don't actually work in the movies: lawyers and marketing people. As if you can't have a life worth living if you aren't famous and not in one of these two careers. Oh, and of course you have to be rich. Even the nanny in this series is a filthy rich girl slumming in Paris. Being middle class is so icky, and forget about being poor. Sickening class warfare is being waged and most people don't even get it.This is probably perfect for Generation Like, or Generation Selfie, or whatever they call themselves. How about Generation Whatever? It claims to be about Paris, but it seems more like a theme park variation of the City of Light, or that place on the Las Vegas strip. Why try to construct real Parisian characters when there are so many stereotypes lying around to recycle, yet again? Did they pay someone to write this mess or did they steal if off the laptop of an unpaid intern they sent out for coffee?"
8,"Emily à Paris, c'est de la merde. This series is full of cringy worn-out stereotypes about the French people and France. If you've never lived in Paris, never visited Paris and never immersed yourself in Parisian culture, you would believe this drivel. It's simply more yelping by an American that Americans are ""exceptional"" and the French are ""lazy, bad and smoke too much"". *YAWN*. And Emily in Paris is a millennial and Gen-Z knock-off of Sex and the City/a fish out of water story, with a demon for a boss. But with all of that said, I have no idea why anyone thinks this is some tour de force series that we've never seen before (The Devil Wears Prada was the best of the best of this genre).Emily in Paris is excruciatingly boring with an extremely weak storyline, and plot holes big enough to fly a 747 through. Darren Starr wrote Sex and the City and he's trying to catch magic in a bottle again, but this ain't it. Emily in Paris is dated ( I hear the 90s calling), stale and Lily Collins is not funny when she should be, and she's not a good enough actress to be convincingly dramatic in other instances. In one scene where she was yelling at her boyfriend, simply sounded shrewish and looked painfully cartoonish. Then in another scene, she acted as if she discovered croissants, and then eating one was some magical experience ( we know in real life young women like her who are influencers and obsessed with posting to Instagram, would take one bite, then exercise for 3 hours because of it). That was worth 100's of eyerolls.As for the other cast members, they're just sleepwalking through their dialogue and scenes. The looks on their faces says it all....they know deep down that this is a disaster dressed up in expensive designer clothes, but it's a paycheck. And speaking of the clothes, I love Patricia Field, she's a costuming genius, but so far from the episodes I've watched, there's nothing mouth-watering in Emily in Paris. I saw a couple pieces I liked, but nothing that I would search high and low trying to find.And much like Sex and the City being set in a major metropolitan city like New York without there even being a Black, Latino or Asian person in sight, Emily in Paris has a similar diversity problem. One Black guy working at the company with Emily, and an Asian woman as her embarrassingly stereotypical wild-child new friend, in a cosmopolitan city like Paris, does not diversity make. I've lived in both cities and you see people of color from all over the globe....everyday. This is 2020 and that's utterly ridiculous to not even see people of color on the streets. I've seen enough of Emily in Paris, and there's no need to go any further with this dull vanilla nothingness of a series."
9,"Terrible acting and writing. It is like pulling teeth watching this. Tired, predictable and obnoxious"
10,"So many clichés it's a little annoying. No all French people don't smoke, we are not all rude, cheating on our spouse, etc..
I have a hard time connecting to the main character. She arrives in Paris with arrogance and naivete, not even bothering to learn the basic French or cultural norms. She's always dressed so weird and act so entitled and know it all. As someone who lived for 6 years in Paris, I can tell you the show paints a very inaccurate image of the life there."
11,"I'm only five minutes into the second episode, but I paused the first episode three times to do far more interesting things around the house. I feel like I'm watching a juvenile version of Carrie Bradshaw's trip to Paris. Lily Collins in zany, Carrie-like costumes feels forced, along with all of the gratuitous shots of Lily's outfits that are clearly product placement. Emily does not feel like a three dimensional character to me. It feels like she's a character type and Lily Collins is far too talented to make me believe it's her acting and not the writers or the director. I was really looking forward to this show because I love SATC and Lily, but this show feels like it was made for pre-teens."
12,"I am a born and raised Parisian, so I expected to watch another bad show/film about Paris. There are still many clichés about the French and Paris, but there are also a lot about the Americans and the USA. The French are mean and rude for the Americans because the French are in my opinion less hypocritical ;) and the Americans are ""ringards"" because you cannot compete with the French sense of class. In the end, it is more a reality than a cliché. Emily made on each outfit at least one fashion mistake!!! But that is how it is supposed to be!Everyone did a great job on the show. It is really rare to watch an American show with so many details about the French culture (or about another that is not American). I even started to think it was French with some American actors.I did not want to give 10 stars because sometimes the characters spoke in English to another although they were both French. For example Antoine and Gabriel spoke in English although Emily was not around. It is a typically mistake on American shows and I think they tried avoiding it but not enough ;)I binged the show in one day, so I would definitely recommend Emily in Paris!"
13,"A bit of a mixed review for this show:
(+) It is light hearted, to be watched for some fun, to pass some time, whenever you don't want to watch anything serious. It only shows the center of Paris (therefore beautiful touristic parts) and the rich life. The main character is pretty, wears colourful clothes.
(-) It is full of stereotypes on France and French people. It would be fine if it were only the light hearted ones (food and cigarettes) but it goes beyond that. It shows that showers often don't work in France because of old buildings ? Not the case, our water system is great. Men often pee in the streets in front of everyone ? No. The main character wants to bring American marketing ideas, and complains that a lady is shown walking naked (from the back only) for a perfume ad, saying it's sexist and that women should be fully clothed, that America wouldn't accept this ad due to a naked woman. She finds it inappropriate and not in the actual feminist context. Does she even know feminism these days has become accepting a woman's body and what she choses to wear or not to wear? Also, isn't America the one country that oversexualises women? Has she even seen American singers, how inappropriate they are in their clips ? Their oversexualisation is way beyond a perfume ad where a woman is simply seen naked from the back."
14,"As an expat who has lived in Paris for several years, the show was painful to watch. Really 10 minutes of serious, unbiased google search would have made this pile of garbage something worth watching.HARD PASS!"
15,Main character is just annoying and for anyone outside of America this is just stupid. How on Earth is someone supposed to like and relate with ignorant social media expert that has a personality of a cartoon character.
16,"An ignorant American visits the rudest city in the world. If you enjoy cringey tv, this might be for you. I can't figure out if they're intentionally making her incredibly ignorant and annoying, or if they just think it's normal to visit a city and disrespect it by not educating yourself and acting humbly. Either way, it's not enjoyable to watch. I like Lily, and I love Paris so I'm hoping this gets better. I'm just not sure I'll be able to make it through."
17,"What an abomination. This is a representation of the state of our civilisation and what a failure it is. How did we get here to a point where on a major Netflix show that so many people in the world watch, this is the quality of writing? If anyone has ever aspired to be a writer of any kind of fiction, this show is an example of how not to write.I don't know if it is the writer's IQ that is so low or they are catering to a low IQ target audience but this is a plastic story with shoehorned themes where the viewer is hit on the head with the point.Not only the dumb representation of French culture, but also the moral high ground from which it spews pseudo-feminist crap, induces cringe. A straw man representation of France is attacked by present day American left wing ideals which are completely devoid of logic. The typical American narcissistic sentiment of considering their present understanding of morality as a worldwide absolute for everyone to follow is present here in the form of a tv series and it induces cringe.Even if we ignore the misrepresentation of France and the crap flinging, it is really the quality of writing used to convey the point that is the biggest failure. I cannot imagine being the writer of this show and having a self conscience.Beautiful visuals though."
18,"I am only into Episode 2 and thought I could at least give this a better review than I am about to but...... it is so bad, makes the French look so dumb. Emily is not even American, she's a English actress trying to use an American accent. I have been to Paris and France a few times and I could not speak a word of French but soon picked some up. The French were never as rude as they are in this. Reading about this show I thought there was going to be more delicious food but so far I have only seen a butter roll.
The characters are so dull and boring, the camera darts across the French landscape so fast it is hard to see what is what
Shame on you Darren Starr for created this total waste, after some of the great shows you have created. Emily walks around in clothes that seem totally Nerang for the season as it appears other people are wrapped up warmer.
How someone cannot not find their way up stairs to their apartment so many times is totally ridiculous. What a total waste of money Netflix making this."
19,"This is just so dreadful in so many ways it's embarrassing. The acting is one dimensional and boring, the outfits are ridiculous and completely unrealistic. You cannot emphasize with Emily as she is so obnoxious, ignorant, narcissistic and stupid that she demonstrates everything that is wrong in the world. The dialogue is stilted and the sets are like something out of Mary Poppins, they are so contrived. Most disturbing is how it inflicts a deeply flawed, American view of the world that centers their values as the one truth. Yuk, yuk, yuk."
20,"Most obnoxious lead character ever, even though I can see the series tries sooo hard to make us like her. Why would anyone sympathize with her is beyond my comprehension.
Example (no spoilers) she is some sort of social media expert (eyeroll) BUT she posts some random young children (cca 7 and 5 y o) publicly on her Instagram profile. She literally posted some CHILDRENS photo online, on her Instagram, public. No, she did not ask the parents, she doesn't even know the parents, she just happened to meet their nanny whilst taking a photo and posting it online.I am so not watching this series, also don't know whats the hype about, also who doesn't know Europe has different electric sockets, are you that oblivious and not interested in country you come to live in? Shame on you, cuz thats just arogant and rude!Never have I ever seen an episode (definitely won't watch more than one) that I hated this much.
Abismal.And no, I'm not French."
21,"Lily Collins lights up the screen.Set in wonderful Paris this show has a marvellous vibe.It is not Game of Thrones but it is fun,and boy do we need some fun."
22,I love this show. It has a great cast and an amazing storyline. The show's fashion's just incredible. The city's filmed a lot and it certainly does make you wanna go to Paris immediately. I don't care how truthful the show is cause it's like a good rom-com that shouldn't end at all. This is a show that puts a smile on your face!
23,"Please make some effort when you write a serie. One person, one adjective... You can predict to many things...And please, it's just a massive amount of cliché about France, it's like to create a series with 5 obeses conspirators and say ""look it's America ! """
24,"A few episodes in and loving this show. I'm originally from France and while many aspects are cliche for comedic effect, a lot of it is actually accurate. Some really clever observations of the French culture. Plus beautiful shots of Paris, and Lily Collins who's stunning. Entertaining, relaxing, and quite informative."
25,"Emily is the shallow but cheerful product of the ""social media culture"" (even if using ""social media"" and ""culture"" in the same sentence is a contradiction in terms).It is difficult to buy her as a marketing executive, but bubbly Emily is shipped to work in Paris to teach those arrogant frogs how to use the new media for the promotion of their luxury products. Unfortunately, Emily speaks no French and the Parisian staff is disdainful and uncooperative.Targeted to American teenagers who never travelled abroad, the series shows an unreal image of Paris, the postcard perfection that exists only in the US collective imagination.The sun is always shining and nowhere to be seen are the hordes of sloppy tourists and locals, infesting the centre of town. All the French characters eat croissants, smoke constantly, are thin and stylish and obviously arrogant and rude.Emily finds them sexist because they use a naked model to advertise a perfume. She is a supporter of #metoo (could it be otherwise?) but she goes to work showing her midriff and wearing micro minis, not exactly appropriate office wear. I know it's all product placement and all her outfits are sponsored, but still...She is supposed to market the agency's luxury goods, but she just markets incessantly her ""perfect"" Parisian life. Not to mention that she manages to make female friends just by walking around and they all look like her: sexually provocative and wearing tight-fitting, product-placed outfits. Did I forget to mention that all men hit on Emily?Finally, having visited Paris many times and speaking both French and English I find some of the dialogues extremely tiring, especially when Emily uses the only two French words widely known by Americans ""Bonjour"" and ""Merci"".PS I am not surprised that Sylvie (the older French female) doesn't like Emily: her frothy, perky attitude would drive me crazy, too."
26,Cliche after cliche. Why do Americans have this absurd idea of Paris and French people? Is this how you think French people live? Really? Netflix and America please stop making stupid series and movies about Paris.
27,"I love Collins' previous works . but this is show is unbearable . boring and not funny at all . i've seen 3 episodes and i'm done . she has to stick to romance because Comedy isn't for her . Such a waste of talent and money .
AND one more thing .Please Hollywood keep ideologies to yourselves . Do Europeans really need your perspective on things ??? give me a break .
3 stars only for good cinematography and Lilly for lightening the screen ."
28,"I couldn't pass chapter 2. It's so narrow minded as If the only point of view that matters is the one from US and as If all the other cultures should learn something from them. The gi is there to save the company from ignorance... This also reflects in the stereotype they portrait of french people. I was always treated with more respect and kindness
in Paris then in the US.
Shame on you, United States..."
29,"Who do we blame for this? It's bad, bad, and bad. Stereotypical tripe... why is this main character/American so egocentric? If she's a social media expert, why does she take the worst photos? Who still does the duck-face and thinks it looks good? Lily is terrible as Emily, she is definitely an Audrey Hepburn rip-off... I wish I could find since redeeming qualities about the show but there isn't any... well, I take it back, the cinematography is great. It's a cringe-fest."
30,"I couldn't stand to watch the first episode till the end because of the TERRIBLE acting of main character!
She is so plastic, the only emotion you see is stupid wide smile. I hate watching it, don't you?
It could be something but they really ruined it with this actress.
How could anyone stand her ????"
31,It seems lighthearted but I could not get over the annoying american. I think she gets better but I didn't like the main character. She made me want to cringe at her narcissistic arrogance. I am sure she learns a lesson in paris but I will never know
32,"It's so bad I have to create an account to write a review for it. I myself lived in Paris for a year, and only the mean Parisian part is right, the rest is ridiculous. The plot and stereotypes of Paris can't be more cliché than this show, so outdated and tacky that I cringed when I watched. The fashion sense of Emily is disastrous, no one wears like that in Paris, even foreigners! Once you wear the barets hat, you are not really ""living"" in Paris... let's talk about the acting, the French actors are all fine, but it's the first time I realized that Lily Colins is actually a bad actor! Did Emily learn anything from living in Paris for that one year? From what I see, none."
33,"I only stuck through the show for the Parisian references as I am an ex pat living in Paris. Other than that it is shallow, very cliché and very much a elongated rip-off of The Devil Wears Prada."
34,Watched it in a day. Loved it even though it was predictable but almost every romcom type show is. Thought all the actors did a great job and the social media spin made a nice change.
35,"This show had potenial, but the stereotypes are just bad, the whole series is just bashing french people. Like Europe is on a different planet than America. In the first episode they even bash Germany, what's wrong with you, if you use stereotypes at least make it funny. The show is cringe and bad and i m not even from France.."
36,It could have been a good show... But apparently writers are just people who never lived in France at all... Full of clichés! Stupid !
37,"Very very shallow. Not funny and just very bad work working with entire story development. If you like little bit of art in the shows or something which doesn't make you feel totally dumb, just save yourself time and don't watch this. Looks popular and super soap opera type of the show. Not mentioning the usage of the phones and social media looks so bad..."
38,"It is unbearably see-through how Lily is trying to be a ditsy copy of Audrey Hepburn and riding on their similarity in looks in the caracterization of Emily but the performance is quite sad to watch. I also see too much influence of Ally McBeal, Gossip Girl, Ugly Betty and Devil Wears Prada but the execution of it for some reason ends up feeling just. so. empty. The 'vibe' of the show is waaay too forced with a god awful and stereotypical representation of the French through the eyes of a privliged white girl, quote 'I didnt get on a plane until I was 12', who on Earth scripted this ?? xD As if it's so relatable. And please, leave a crease in the outfit or a piece of actors hair to fly out a little for god's sake, they all look like dolls. I believe viewers would prefer a piece of reality in this predictable fairytale. I'd say more but it's really not worth more typing, just watch Sex Education or Derry Girls on Netflix instead, they're way more colorful, exciting and edgier than this ringarde."
39,"I love SATC and Younger so I was so excited for this. I wonder if Darren Starr got into a fight with Netflix or something because this show is lacking in so many aspects but had so much potential!! Sadly, it turned like a bad romantic comedy from the 90's: the characters have no depth or development, they are ridiculous characterizations, there are no other than white thin straight privileged people (ok, one black guy and one asian friend) the storyline is boring and predictable and dialogs are ridiculous.
Every episode has the same formula:
Emily eats a pain au chocolat/croissant in a Parisian café.
Emily posts a photo of Paris on her IG account.
Emily goes to the office and everyone around her is lazy and mean.
A french women tells Emily she doesn't eat, she smokes a cigarette.
There is a ""marketing problem"", everyone's ideas are bad.
Emily comes up with a ""fantastic"" idea that goes viral and saves the day (also, is this show sponsored by Instagram?).
Emily's boss is jealous.
Emily meets a guy, guy falls for her because she is so beautiful.
Emily meets with a friend after work.
Emily ends up flirting with the chef at the restaurant around the corner before going home.3 stars, for the amazing shots of Paris and because I think this show's target are girls from 12 to 16 y/o.
Also, why is the main character such a prude??"
40,"What an infantile hassle this series. stigmatizing, boring and above all not funny"
41,"I don't understand why is this show attracting so much hate. Sure, the show is making jokes about French and American stereotypes, and nothing is real - all French in the show speak amazing English with very little French accent. And the job is too easy, and the lead actress seems to be too lucky, and so on.But come on, it's not a thriller or a documentary. It's a different genre and within this genre you don't have to show reality as close as possible.Occasionally there were some jokes that made me lough and the image in general is pretty good with some nice Paris views. It's very light, there is no aggression or violence or hate or negativity of any kind in this TV show which is a plus as wellI think it's an okay mainstream TV show"
42,Very predictable and the main character is superficial and a very bad friend! Only good to see as company while doing something else...
43,"We don't smoke inside, nor do ""la bise"" to strangers in a professional setting. Our men certainly don't hit on you, except if they're riff-raff, but we use dating apps and sut up, like everyone else. Also, French men don't particularly like older women, the president has been criticised ever since he ran for presidency because of his wife. People are divided on the subject, and so on.
So yeah it's not conveying the cliché of the cat old guy with a béret on the head, a baguette under the arm, and saucisson in the hand, but it's still conveying a false image of the French."
44,"First off...how dare anyone compare this to Sex in the City. Which was well acted, written and actually funny!!This is absolute pretentious cliched drivel!! Suitable for:-
#selfieobsessed #selfabsorbed #generationZ #sillyteenagers #stereotypesI will usually give a show a chance and watch at least the first two episodes.
However, I'm 21.23 in and its time to hit the back button"
45,"This show is potato chips. Tastes ok, no substance or nutritional value. I call these shows my hair drying shows. Not good enough to watch with my husband or really pay attention. I watch while I dry my hair or put on makeup. I think the main character is very pretty and I enjoy her outfits. And of course everyone she meets is hyper attractive and equally groomed. So watch for some eye candy and silly scenarios. It definitely takes you into a different (not super believable) realm where you can just keep popping those potato chips and relax."
46,"Sorry, but if you genuinely enjoy this, you're basic.I understand the need for escapism in a year like 2020 but there's no excuse for poor writing and bad acting just for the sake of escapism. One can ""escape"" in much better writ, lighthearted series like Mrs Maisel or Schitt's Creek.This is a bad 2000's romcom. All the cultural and personal dramas are cliché and badly executed. Her romantic encounters all come across as artificial and forced. No chemistry.It's what 18 year olds probably thought Paris was before the internet. And it's not even ironic to justify this tacky series. The only thing I respect is how Patricia Field made her look so matchy marcha to combine with her American tackiness and lack of understand of the culture. I'm sure she purposefully made matched Chanel outfits look like Forever 21 to underline the characters lack of self-awareness and delusion.In the end, if you're a fan of Sex and the City, like me, this won't suffice. Not by a mile."
47,"First i will say to all the french people, sorry for the american view of the french people.. I know it is not true... so with that in mind i can say that i loved it for what it is ,fiction about an am.girl in Paris who falls in love with the city AND the people there, about trying to fit in in a new society and evolving as a person. it´s funny and romantic . Just up my alley, i recommend it for all the S.A.T.C and Younger fans.. Enjoy!!!
PS. By the way we europeans think you americans are a little wierd too ;) ;)"
48,"Ugh so hard to watch without cringing. Is that the intention? If so, they nailed it."
49,"Lily Collins is small and looks younger than her thirty years. She plays the title role of Emily, a marketing executive, who we first meet working at a firm in Chicago. The company has acquired a Paris subsidiary and Emily's boss is about to move there when she discovers she's pregnant. Emily has to take on the role at the last minute, and with practically no French.The premise is good and the way French is introduced works nicely, but the execution overall is let down by fairly weak characterisation, especially for the supporting cast in Paris.Sylvie, played by Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, who's billed at number two for the series, is a particular issue. She's the manager at the Paris agency, resentful of Emily's presence and everything she represents especially about the importance of social media. Sylvie has parallels to Meryl Streep's role in The Devil Wears Prada. But Streep's character fizzed with a mixture of bullying, brittle malevolence and disguised vulnerabilities. She owned the screen and commanded your attention. Sylvie, by comparison, just seems shallow, rude and annoying. Perversely, her English, after first episode, seems too good for someone who sits firmly on the Parisian side of the culture clash that is often a central theme of the show.The Paris nanny, Mindy, ostensibly Chinese but actually, again, a little too American is also rather shallow, while the chef, Gabriel - a major love interest for Emily - is more convincing.The work of the Paris agency is often important to the plot, but the team of beautiful people just seem to flit from one superficial PR event to to the next via influencers, followers, promotions and social media campaigns often consisting of a single slogan - all of this honoured with the rather lofty title marketing. Maybe this is fairly realistic, but Lily's constantly changing stream of designer outfits - perhaps a little product placement - seems unreal and distracting.Paris itself is loved, but the citizens get a pretty rough ride - lazy, rude, promiscuous, sexist, and constantly smoking indoors even though this is now illegal. At times they're even singled out from other French people who are seen more sympathetically. I couldn't say how much this is stereotype and how much reality, but it's as unremittingly negative as Emily is unremittingly upbeat.This is no Sex in the City yet, but overall the series is watchable and undemanding. If you're short on time you might check just episodes 1 and 8 (which is set outside Paris). I think these two would stand alone. The last episode is also satisfactory and the story might bear a second series, especially if there are a couple of changes. 6.5/10."
50,Everything with Lily Collins in it is undoubtedly the best. I loved the comic timing in this show and especially the fast pased storyline! Cinematography is unique too!! Overall Emily in Paris is a super nice way to start a weekend!!
51,"Ok. I'm 52. What do I care? So let's see now... reading other reviews... cliché, weak characters, bad acting... blah blah blah. It's like drinking wine. You like, it's a good wine, you don't like? Don't drink it. Get over it. Lily in Paris is fun. Lily is cute. It's a bit of escapism. Paris looks great. It's silly and funny. If it's not for you, fine. Go watch highbrow. But don't comment how shallow this is. Is meant to be. Go away now and don't come back."
52,"I'm still surprised how American people see Paris. It hasn't changed for decades! Paris is again presented as a cliché where our heroine can sway around the city dressed like nobody does in reality. And everybody seems to be fine with it. Which they are not. Parisians are judgmental and sometimes condescending (I used to be like this).This series is full of the same cliches that have been used time and time again in romantic comedies : the unfaithfulness of the French, their love for food etc. Being an (ex) Parisian myself i would have expected something a bit more real, at least in terms of her experience. Yes, they mention Parisians (not all French) are mean and come to work much later than Good Americans who are still represented as ""know it all"" and want to teach the poor Europeans how it's done... so nothing new under the sun here...
I've watched 2 episodes and I'm already bored..."
53,"I appreciate that it is meant to be light-hearted, but the ridiculous ease with which Emily achieves everything from gaining social media followers, to meeting other beautiful, English-speaking people on benches, to coming up with ground-breaking marketing ideas, is insulting to even the most vacuous viewer.Combine this with awful clichés and stereotypes; one-dimensional characters and the plot depth of a car park puddle, and it is so poor, that it doesn't even work as hangover distraction.Avoid."
54,"I've enjoyed watching it.
You don't need to expect much. Its an easy&funny one to watch."
55,"Boring, full of cliche, not very smart main character. It's all i can say about Emily in Paris."
56,"Embarrassing to watch. The storyline seems as though it was written by a 14 year old blogger. Main character's acting isn't enough. The mean boss character is pathetic. The only two decent actors are Gabriel and Camille.
One does not simply post three photos on instagram and become an icon. It doesn't work that way. Just goes to say that whoever wrote this doesn't know much about marketing.
This show feels like taking a garbage bag to the most beautiful place in the world and spending millions on shooting it. Stinks."
57,This show is a lot of fun. i wasn't expecting it to be some groundbreaking piece of drama portraying the real Paris nor do i think that's what it's going for. the cliches and the over-the-top plots are done for comedic effect. it knows exactly what its doing and the audience it's catering to. the episode where emily is in Champagne was especially hilarious. i for one enjoyed it for what it is - a fun and frivolous romp that takes my mind off covid and 2020 for a bit.
58,"So it's 2am and I desperately need to get to bed. Nevertheless I'm compelled to write this review. (Which I rarely do.)As a single, straight, white male (born in the States, of French heritage and speaks the language) I probably wouldn't be considered the target audience for this show. However I found Emily in Paris to be absolutely charming.
The actors are endearing. The storyline refreshingly simple. And the location? It's Paris!
Ignore the ""movie-critic-wannabees"" who think they understand the cultural differences between France and America. They can't see the ""forest for the trees"".
The show is meant to be a light-hearted romp through one of the most romantic cities in the world. Viewed through the eyes of a young woman who's learning to navigate career, romance, and the highs and lows that each bring.Cliches? Does everything have to be new and original? I'm perfectly ok with cliches if they're done well.I think we can all use a little joy and romance during these times (hell, all the time!)
So if you want to take a trip but don't want to deal with travel at this time. Sit back, relax with a bowl of popcorn and join Emily in Paris!"
59,"That difficult moment when you agree with every comment and want to give 3/10 and 8/10 in the same time. Isn't it almost new ""Friends"" of 2020?"
60,"As a person who has lived in France for few yearsI can say that I felt offended by the oblivious this show is to the actual culture, problems, people in France. At first I though ""oh ok it's going to present some cliches as a comedy type-thing"" but when EVERYTHING is a cliche is pretty understandable that is not for laughing intentions but more because of the absolute lack of knowledge of anything from the writer.First: all people are super into speaking English with the protagonist... when majority of French WON'T and why would they? I mean is their country this person is coming to live there and doesn't even bother to learn any French? Also as a foreign language teacher I can tell you that in 3 months of living in a language context with some effort you can speak... but that is what infuriated me the most... she doesn't even try!Second: the fashion and meal habits of this girl are totally unbelievable nobody dresses like that and eats everything outside... She doesn't even know how to cook an omelette? REALLY? And also what kind of French cook does an omelette for breakfast? WtF?Thirdly: All men want to sleep with her...I mean why? I get it she is pretty... and? Another stupid tourist from my perspective nobody would even notice her in real life.Also the city is super clean, white, cheap (since she gets to live in a nice neighborhood without having to cook or share with anyone) and without taking the public transport... she never even visits nothing in Paris and yet gets to meet all the right super rich people there... REALLY? She is not funny or smart and the plot is just bananas. What a shame!"
61,"This new serie is so awful and I have only seen one episode. I don't know if this is a try to create a ""sex and the city "" for the younger generation but it fails completely. Mostly for the stereotypes.The french are horrible chainsmokers who are mean, sneaky, arrogant and unpolite.The lead character is rude and don't try at all to blend in or be interested in the culture. (Thinking of the scene at the restaurang.), not even to learn the language when you're going to work and live there says it all.What is extra annoying is the sounds that occur every time she uses her mobile phone. Reduce the social media properly, maybe you get a second season."
62,"I was going to write a long review to expose everything bad in this show but that'd be giving it too much credit. Non exhaustive list:
clichés could be funny (well, some of them) but they're so overused it gets boring 10mins into the show, LESS IS MORE (and I love second degree)characters are so disconnected from Parisians (/french people) it really feels like a constant attack.can 100% tell the people who wrote the script never lived in Paris (heck, in a different country?).too bad, this was a good opportunity to mix comedy and culture (heh, at least we got a picture of a ""Pain au chocolat"" served by a grumpy baker, dayum what a wonderful country we live in!)no, lazy french people are not scared of hard working American (the main character have revolutionary ideas about how to use Instagram, and she starts working at 8:30am, watch out!)people who enjoyed that show and think this is remotely based on true facts, please continue discovering different culture from the comfort of your sofa :)if you still want to go on and watch this, please get ready for the non stop cringy bad sweat.To end on a good note, for the ones who'd love a good and hilarious movie about self entitled french people (second degree and plenty of clichés), watch OSS117.Let's reflect on the fact that a lot of people got paid to write this pile of crap."
63,Emily is upset because the word vagina in french is male gender. Ok Netflix and writers. You prove yourself once again.
64,"I only watched because I am home sick of my city, Paris. That is why I give a 3 stars, otherwise it would be only a 1.Who chose the clothes for Emily? They are ridiculous!Nothing is real, except the good food. Stereotypes, cliches. And the main character Emily is an obnoxious know it all."
65,"But mainly because I needed something with no brains and just fun. It is colorful and nicely pictured and vary vary shallow. The main character has no character and everything is shallow. So do not expect much, watch it if you like prettly clothes."
66,"I don't usually enjoy watching such series. I'm not even trying to watch them. But something in this specific series attracted me. Maybe it's my love for the amazing Lily Collins.. I can't say the series was ""wow"" but it passed my time with fun, there was a little cynical humor there that is exactly what I love And the romantic relationship between Emily and Gabriel made me want to keep watching a new episode every time.
If you are looking for a nice, easy, funny series it's exactly for you."
67,"Oh My Goodness! This show is absolutely spectacular.It is the exact thing that we needed in our lives right now, some fresh and beautiful French scenery, some amazing fashion visuals by the stunningly perfect Lily Collins.Booking my flight to Paris next year just because of this. BINGE-Worthy! Oh Lily u piece of art <3"
68,"I've finished the first episode and it may be too early to write this review but I couldn't stop myself.
What's with all the French people shown so rude at main protagonist's work place? It almost looks deliberate to show what a good american our protagonist is not minding all the negativity thrown at her and acting all cool. And the only friendly character so far is chinese."
69,"I dont know but I love it... I love the place, actors and the cinematography is great!"
70,I can't remember the last time I watched a show with a big grin on my face from start to finish and I'm a man in my 40s! Its mostly a light hearted fun series but credit goes to the actors who made these characters real and likable and also the whole crew who made every scene look so charming and pretty. Its just the sort of stuff one needs to watch in times like these.
71,"I like Emily in Paris ! She's charming and lovely !
If you need something simple and easy breezy then watch this ! Very enjoyable ! I don't care about the cliches because It's nice to watch ! So thumbs up"
72,"For someone who loved Gossip Girl this show is the exact thing I needed right now! Fashion, love and girl power ! 10 episodes is just not enough!
Lily Collins is just amazing and so is everyone else! I hope season 2 will arrive ASAP since I finished it in one night."
73,"In such a doom and gloom time, this was just the pick me up show I needed.Lilly Collins is beautiful and charming and the whole story had me gripped from the first episode. French culture, stunning fashion and handsome men. What's not to love?!"
74,Dont listen to the snobs. Just watch an episode and decide for yourself. My wife and I bonged it in 3 days and my mother in law in one . Decide for yourself
75,"Beautiful series. Yes there are cliches but most of them are true and quite funny
Lily is gorgeous. Hoping for a second season"
76,"This series is so unrealistic, i liked Luc when he said that ""American shows are always full of unrealistic happy events"" she goes to Paris, finds the perfect friend, i mean Mindy. Also each guy she sees literally simps for her and likes her immediately ""Gabriel, the guy she saw at Mindy's party, Thomas, Mat, Camille's brother"" like really? Also whatever she says, everyone just agrees on it and be like ""wow, she is so smart"" and just gives the credit to her, she literally solved every problem in the show except for the 2 million dollars watch. Come on, this isn't how life goes, that's so dishonest and unrealistic. Also didn't like how disloyal she was, she sleeps with this guy and kisses this guy and thinks of this guy. She is a bad friend as well, i feel so sorry for what she did to Camille, she hugs her and at night she sleeps with her boyfriend. Literally Netflix can't stop making movies and series about how easy life is, but it's not. Nothing about this show is real, this isn't real life."
77,"That's really good, you will get lost in this amazing city with this gorgeous actress. This tv show is light, enjoyable and makes you wanna finish all episodes at once. All the characters have their own singularity and the funny plots are the best!"
78,This show was so fun! It is full of life! It really captured beautiful shots of Paris. Loved the cinematography in this! All of Lily's outfits were on point! I really enjoyed all of this! This was such an easy watch that I binged it all! However the story you can really tell it is from the American perspective especially when it comes to the French culture. It is a pretty predictable show but all of the characters were so fun to watch. I hope to see a season 2 because it definitely needs one!
79,"First of all, the acting is so meh. It feels like the acting you would except from a Disney Channel show with teen actors. Second, within the first 10 minutes of the first episode, they are already perpetuating stereotypes about diabetes, they are being fatphobic, and they are giving false information about France and French culture. This show is terrible."
80,"I was really looking forward to this.
I wasn't expecting much, I knew what it's supposed to be. But wow, it's just so so bad.
I had a hard time finishing this.I like Lily Collins so I thought it would be easy to like the character. But from the start I was already feeling a tinge of annoyance. And when she got to Paris, ugh. It's downhill from there.Wth is wrong with her? I had the same reaction toward her as her french boss/colleagues. I think I hurt my eyes from the constant rolling.This whole show tries too hard and fails.
No wit or humor. Stereotypes and clichés abound. Awful script/dialogues. And no, the fashion is not good.
Everything is cringey & annoying especially the main character. Why they made her this ignorant & ditzy I don't understand.The only saving grace is Paris."
81,"I had high hopes for this because I really like Lily Collins but I barely made it through the first episode. I knew from the opening scene where Emily runs 5 miles this wasn't for me or relatable. Isn't the girl working a ""unrealistic dream job"" in fashion kind of cliche? I'd love to see a lead female play something actually interesting. Maybe it's me but marketing and social media jobs aren't intriguing!
Based off the first episode all the characters are unlikable. They use the Parisians are rude trope which in my experience is not true! I went to Paris alone and met so many friendly people there. Yes I ran into a rude Uber driver or two but the same goes for where I live (NYC).
I don't understand who this show is made for, maybe teen girls? So cringe and boring."
82,"It's so trashy and ridiculous.
Let's be real - it's something that never would happen in the real life. None of the story plots makes sense.
But this is the point, isn't it?
The point is to light up the mood of the audience and leave all the reality troubles behind even if the temporary stress relief only lasts the time of one episode.
While we are going through all the realistic tests and challenges, now Covid-induced family separation and all the crazy things around the world, a ridiculous story like this makes your mind ""run away"" from the harsh reality.
We are all too serious. Sometimes all we need is a moment feeling free and ridiculous."
83,"This TV Show has huge potential. The first season is always about building a solid story line. This touches on romance, friendship and adventure. I look forward to the next season and how it develops."
84,I need to see more Netflix 😭😭 please!! Living my fantasy of traveling though this show
85,Love the drame and style and the story line. Hope to see more.
86,"Funny, smart and amazing fashion!! Great entertainment with interesting characters and relationships as France takes on America."
87,"I enjoyed watching this show, Lily Collins fits the part perfectly. Firstly, not sure why it's being compared to Sex and the City and secondly not sure why critics are panning it because of the stereotypes. There are no stereotypes here. If you had the exact same characters but set it in The UK or America, no one would say anything. Just people looking for an excuse to be miserable. It's a light hearted show, nothing amazing but keeps you entertained, plus gorgeous guys, so what's not to like? Not sure it's the kind of show that will last long because of the theme and title but I hope there is at least a season 2."
88,"Humiliatingly bad. One of the worst things I have ever watched in my life. As someone who lived in Paris, I am upset for Parisiennes. For someone who has eyes, ears and a brain, I am upset for me. This show was literally offensive in its portrayal of the French. The main character Emily is wildly unlikable. The writing is god awful. I would give ANYTHING to erase this show from my memory because I literally can not stop thinking about how much I hated this show."
89,"I love it!! So funny,drama, romance great fashion, great show"
90,"I am exactly 18 minutes in, and I can't get over how excruciatingly basic Emily is. And as someone who works in social media and marketing, this is a cushy dream scenario that would never happen. This show is just another excuse for writers to fabricate an exceedingly superficial storyline with the trope of a cute but quirky girl in an uncomfortable new setting. They tease you with her ""struggles"" that are not struggles because she is pretty, young, successful, and annoyingly vibrant. Huge yikes from me, and the way she floats from scene to scene just reminds me of why so many people hate white girls, especially American ones. Her movie references are cringe too. Like really? Your French films are Moulin Rouge, Ratatouille, and Saving Private Ryan? Unbelievably cringe. She doesn't deserve Paris and the culture it beholds. Undoubtedly our heroine will parade through this worldly exotic adventure with tons of wine, romance, drama, and a senior marketing promotion at the end of this. As someone with real life problems like the actual disgusting amount of sweat and a flushed tomato look that actually occurs after running 5 miles, I cannot sit here and watch this Emily deal with her poor ""problems."" Naive and basic. No thanks. Au revoir."
91,This series is so boring and bad. I don't advice this series.
92,"Everything is wrong in this show. It depicts French people as mean, sexist, rude, obsessed with sex, way too unhinibited, or crazy at best (do Americans really believe French parents would welcome their daughter's friend naked? Or ask her if their son is a good lover? And giving a tour of the house when your host is going to spend the week end is something we do, just like you)
The acting is terrible, especially from the French cast (but maybe it's just because they're are forced to speak frenglish) Everything from the situations to the vocabulary is awkward, almost as if the director had never talked to French people... Or set a foot in France before.
Yes you can seat in cafés during the fashion week if you don't choose the most expensive and touristy ones (which is only the smart thing to do for they are far from the best. I don't even notice the fashion week when it takes place)
Cheating is not the national sport and is frowned upon like anywhere else. Camille, Gabriel and Mindy are not representative of Parisians in their 30's, either in their attitude or the way they dress. I don't know anyone who would eat breakfast, lunch and dinner out (this is not the US) and it only takes two hours to drive to Normandy, so, No, Gabriel is not moving across the country. But then again maybe Darren Star doesn't realize that.Sylvie is not snob or classy or French, she's just rude.Everything in this show is a lie, stupid and offensive. Real Paris, real France and real French people are muuuuch more interesting... And real ! That just looks like a nauseous postcard.(and yes, I live in Paris. Near the Pantheon as well)"
93,"Don't listen to those people writing those negative reviews, they're all nervous.
(credit to W C Fields in The Barber Shop)
This flick doesn't take itself seriously, so why should you?
Eye candy, hormone candy, fashion candy. Over the top production quality.
Lighten up and have some fun."
94,"Must watch and good,nice comedy and romance good acting best series of 2020"
95,"My gf is watching this. You can't believe this can be interesting to someone. so look at those stupid eyes on the lead actress. that cliché of conversation, degenerate stereotypes, people who speak English with a bad French accent. 10 minutes before something happens, you know it's going to happen. Has the world and reality gone so far that this is good for people. Where is your creativity people? Intellect? Is everything stupidly good? Turn off the globe and let's go again."
96,"Not to much complicated yet a simple, funny at times, good to soul types series. Cannot wait for next season loved it
Go for it . Has love, romance, fashion, beauty and elegance."
97,"This is a light and easy to watch series! It just has a cheerful view of things that I really enjoy! It is also so so beautiful! All the scenery, the clothes and of course Lily Collins! It really brought a positive vibe on my day! Can't wait for new episodes!"
98,"Emily is the ultimate Ugly American. She not only arrives expecting to join a workforce without knowing a word of French, she cannot understand anyone else's perspective or even appreciate that they might have one that is different from hers. Her constant selfies correspond to her self-centeredness. If at least she grew in the course of the season! But she is as irritatingly tone-deaf and chirpy after a season- ful of experiences as at the beginning. Then there are all the cliches about the French! Seeing Paris again through the camera's eye was the only bright spot in this cringe-worthy series, but it wouldn't be enough to make me watch another season."
99,I loved most about Emily isn't the Content but how joyful and positive and nice she is which makes the whole series worth watching
100,"This is a simple well written rom com set it Paris with stunning scenery, fashion and a interesting if somewhat unlikely story line that is simply meant to be fun.The uptight reviews should be ignored if you want something light to enjoy and in 2020 to take you from reality that is exactly what this show does. It is so needed right now.Praise to Lily for her acting and production.Fun, fun, fun enjoy it for what it is nothing else."
101,"I love Paris. Love to visit and can't wait to return. Emily in Paris is what some young women dream and think that they could be her. But the reality is that it's not that easy. This is an interesting series and I watched it for the scenery. It also helps my French listening to the Parisians talking.Most of the Parisians I've encountered have been very polite. My high school French gets me through the country. Some have allowed me to practice my French which you'd think Emily, with all her energy and gung-ho, would be practicing and learning with the same amount of attention like how she approaches her projects.It's entertaining to watch and not to be taken so seriously. I can see the French are not too pleased, I wouldn't be either. Granted, there are some French who are rude, like the guy that was behind me when I was trying to buy my pastries. Again, EIP is a fantasy show. Although, I think that it's a version of Carrie Bradshaw if she were in her twenties living right now. Her Paris adventure was never really explored fully. EIP looks like a ""what if?""I do hope there's a season two."
102,There are some enjoyable aspects about this series. 1. The on location shooting is beautiful and showcases the nicest aspects of the city. Gardens restaurants the opera house and even a trip to the countryside are all shown at their best. Some of the fashion is a bit garish. 2. The story is engaging enough. The culture clash differences in values thing is always a rich source of laughs and entertainment. The French sexual morals and legendary meanness are contrasted with American standards. Some laugh out loud twists. There is an SATC like theme of frequent sexual encounters. 3. The cast is likeable and attractive. Lily acts well and is always fun to watch. Her friend who is played by Broadway star Ashley Park gets to sing some nice songs. The French actors they chose speak English and have comprehensible accents. Don't like the character of the nasty boss - it's not funny just tiresome. This show isn't a huge commitment with short episodes. So it's worth a watch. Hope there will be a second season.
103,Lily Colins is a terrible actress. I couldn't even survive 1 episode. It was so bad and...idk. I have nothing left to say.
104,Seen it all before a million times. France made to look awful through a fake and ignorant lens of petty cliché. Utter nonsense. This production insults the intelligence of Netflix subscribers.
105,"It makes me smile the whole episode the only thing that made me upset that it is over already !!! Why too soon ?!!! Anyway it's light , cheerful , easy ,funny , relaxing not too much drama and complications it's like this good place to go to away from the dark reality we're living in , and I absolutely love the outfits"
106,"Emily in Paris! Well, I wanted to see a charm from this tittle and this series didn't disapoint me. It is a nice comedy series. Emily is introducing American point of view in French culture. But I think this series requires another season to complete the story. You will find every quality in Emily. She is fun, serious at work and also trying to find a settle life with someone she truly loves. But what the French culture can provide her? That's the question arised in my mind everytime. At the end I have found this series is going to have a nice ending in upcoming seasons.Can't wait for the next season."
107,Love it! I don't care about cliché. I think this tv show is fresh bright and brings me joy! That is all I need! Love it!
108,"The devil wears Pravda lite.
Silly, fun, frivolous, with the emphasis on fun.
Lighthearted with a feel good factor.
Lily Collins is charming , and does a good job with a rather predictable script, she's likeable, pretty and holds
It all together , the last episode was disappointing, a bit like an afterthought, but all in all, very watchable."
109,"This TV Series is perfect if you're looking for something light, funny and romantic. It's even more perfect if you're looking for a feel-good movie. Absolutely love it!"
110,I just finished the show and I must say wow. I have been many times to Paris and I love how the series shows all the beautiful places in Paris. The show has a great storyline. A rom-com that you hope never ends. I love Lilly Collins and I hope I can see her back soon as Emily for season 2!
111,"Loved it !! I'm married to a Parisian and I totally get Emily , it's so hard to make French friends so I totally get that cliche , this show makes me miss Paris so much !!"
112,Give it a chance. I wasn't convinced after the first episode but decided to go for one more. It's uncomplicated & easy to watch. Have we seen the premise before? Sure but it's breezy and interesting all the same.
113,"I was not very enthusiastic about this TV show, but I started it and was pleasantly surprised. The people who say 'it's full of clichés' probably don't have a lot of french friends.It's light, funny, the people and the scenery are beautiful. Kudos to Lilly Collins, she does a pretty good job, you immediately know she's not an annoying american, but a driven young woman."
114,"So many reviews about how cringe the show is, first of all it's from the makers of ""Sex and the city"" also if you don't enjoy Rom-com's or buttery movie's you will not like it or even hate it, Lily Collins as Emily Cooper is flawless! The way she carries herself is just beautiful! The story is simple and has Rom-com feel to it, don't expect something like Devil vs Prada, give it a try before going through 1 Star review. You might Love it!"
115,"I'm just gonna say it. It's super cheesy, stereotyping and unrealistic. Emily is too privileged to be relatable. Sometimes the scenery looks quite photoshopped. Butttttt I can't help watching it! It's light hearted, fun and fast faced. The fashion and scenery are great to look at. I learnt a bit more about France. And may I just say that GABRIEL IS GORGEOUS! It's all too good to be true but it's really good way to escape from my mundane lockdown life."
116,"Please tell us there is MORE!! Everything about this Netflix series is what a gal needs to lift and boost her during these crazy times! Loved every bit of it. Love the cast, love it all! The fashion and setting! Love love love. Season 2 come come come please!"
117,"I really don't understand the haters, what did you expect from a show like this? It's just fun, light entertainment, and for that genre, it's pretty well done.
Lilly Collins is very good in her role, the rest of the cast is doing what they were supposed to do, technically so so but again, light entertainment it is...
As for the cliché about the French, what do you even know about the French? Not even the French know much about the French, and that's the part of their charm and irresistibility.
The French and France: unconditionally unpredictable, and this show depicts that just fine.
I liked it - and no, it's not the GoT."
118,WE NEEEED A MORE TV SERIES LIKE THIIISSS AND YOUNGER AND SATC PLLSSSSSSSSS
119,I absolutely love Emily in Paris! Love the characters even Sylvie. Enjoyed every episode! Looking forward to season 2! Its a new Netflix series to look forward to!
120,Decent programme while in lockdown. Blasted them all in 1 afternoon. Very styalised
121,"If, like me, you look for good tv to watch with your (nearly) teenage daughter then be warned that some episodes are rated 15 and are a bit risqué. Personally, I love it but won't be sharing the experience with my daughter."
122,Emily en París es de esas series con tramas comunes y súper simples que te atrapan y no puedes dejar de ver. Lily Collins ¡excelente!
123,"Easy watch to relax after a long day at work.
The show is full of stupid cliches. And guess what, THAT is the exact reason why it is actually fun to watch. In fact, both Gossip Girl and Sex and the City are not any better.P.S. We all know you've been to Paris and ""it is nothing like in the Emily in Paris""."
124,"This show takes you on a young adult's journey to today's Paris and presents some cultural social contrasts in a light stereotypical way.The main character is too basic for Lily Collins. Emily is a 20-year-old-ish ignorant American (except for social media) who speaks in her own language to everybody after taking on a job in France for marketing of high profile plain clients. English is spoken through 99% of the show.Despite the harsh reviews, Emily in Paris exists to be something easy to watch. The highlights, or simply what the show focuses on, are her experiences: managing work and being an influencer (yup), making friends and seeing men, also getting involved in a love triangle. As a rom-com, there are moments of fun and comedy. Stunning cast and locations.That is pretty much what you get. It simply felt like it could have been a movie. Not deep, not surprising, yet enjoyable."
125,I hate everything about this show. Emily is quite possibly the most annoying character to have graced our screens in a long time.She is so annoying you just want her to fail and have that smug look wiped off her face. Et voila!
126,"Truly offensive. Silly and sexist plot. Soap
Opera acting at best."
127,"Knowing that this was produced by Darren Starr, who also did Sex and the City my expectations were high. However, this show doesn't have any of the charm, story and fashion from the Sex and the City. It's more of a comic book turned into a TV show, aimed perhaps for the teenagers. Make up was horrendous, clothes that Emily wore were clownish, dialogue boring, full with stereotypes."
128,"The only saving grace is Paris itself. Otherwise, it's all stereotypes; dumb hayseed American who cant see herself, rude and haughty French people, predatory French men (predatory by American PC standards - just normal guys, actually). As one who has been to Paris, I can say that I never encountered a rude French person. This was easy; be nice, conduct yourself as a guest in another persons home (because you are). Learn a little French, and don't expect it to be America, because it's not."
129,I have no idea why this gets such good reviews. At best it is OK. I only give 1 Star because so many people give high marks. Do not spend energy to watch it.
130,"Even if we ignore the clichees portrait here and the way this series paints the french.In the end they almost got to some interesting topics (how advertisement and fashion chages with the new generations) but that seemed to be an accident...)Emily is just a horrible Character, cheating around leading on everyone while thinking shes the best that ever happened to Paris.
The series tries and convince us how lovable and nice she is and I dont get why, you wanna make a series about a horrible person? Sign me up! But what is this supposed to tell us?
I see this ridiculous shift of ethics everywhere lately and it's flabbergasting to me.
I'm not saying it is realistic that every character is nice, but to pretend they are while they are cheating and lying around and being a useless piece of work that does nothing but post on Instagram nonstop is disgusting."
131,"Message to American film makers (including Woody Allen): Give Paris a rest and find another place for your little fantasies... Even Hemingway did not really ""see"" Paris (with all the preconceived images he had already in mind before arriving)."
132,"What an irritating leading actress. And are you guys literally making a series heavily focused on ""influencers"" and social media nonsense? What a waste of time.."
133,I could only think of 1 thing throughout the first episode! Did no one cringe reading the script?? I give it 3 for fashion
134,A very enjoyable and entertaining series. The intention was to watch one episode and boom I just finished the entire series.
135,"I'm a huge fan of SEX AND THE CITY, so I was prepared to suspend disbelief, but this show asks too much.Reference is frequently made to ""An American In Paris,"" but a more apt comparison would be, ""A Big Mac among French cuisine.""A lead who, though charming, is supposedly a business whiz kid; but she constantly bursts in because that's how Americans are: loud and boorish.Supposedly Emily is sent from the company who acquired the French firm, but the purpose isn't quite clear considering the expense of relocating her to Paris. The in-office treatment just doesn't make sense -- she's from the ""head office,"" the French team should be kissing her American rear.Why she doesn't crash study French s a big question mark. She's still blabbing ""Bone Jurrr"" into the sixth episode.Lastly, why in 2020 is Emily only able to be intimate after getting drunk? And where are the gays?I'm not mad at this show, but I didn't love it."
136,"Having lived in Paris for 6 years I can assure you that this show is just choc full of useless, outdated clichés and stereotypes. It's Sex and the City 2 for 2020, and 2020 was bad enough. Don't waste your time."
137,"It is very funny and fluent, it never gets boring but it is so unrealistic. She met random people in street and become best friend, every man in the series falls in love with her and every move that she does in her job turn out perfect and succesfully. Also, events are so cliche and predictable. But, if you love fashion and romantic comedies, you enjoy the show as outfits are really great ."
138,"Since I study Marketing I really loved this serie, as how social media is in fact crazy populair for advertising. It is really nice to see a series based on social media and marketing. Binge watched it in 2 days and definitely looking forward for season 2. Romantic aspects were predictable, but almost every romantic movie/serie is."
139,"A romantic, anachronistic, mysterious, full of lights and beauty with well dressed people in every corner of Paris...this is how Americans sitting far away from Paris see this city. Reality is, however, different. It is expensive, filthy, crowded with tourists (before COVID-19 time), mugging, shady characters at every corner of street, hostile street hustlers, you name it. Your average French person, who lives in cruel reality, would love to nuke this city to oblivion after moving iconic structures away."
140,"I watched this series on Netflix with a lot of excitement.However everything is wrong in this series, full of clichés that you can imagine when writing something about the ideal Paris that we all dream of. Yes it's full of cringe, full of wrong ideas about Paris, about the life here. It's poorly written, even for young teenagers that would deserve better.I don't recommend watching the series except if you want to cringe and have a good cynical laugh.Then go back to your everyday life, go in the metro (line 13 for example), be harassed by strange men in the streets that smell like pee, cross the path of a crack addict, and get your necklace stolen by a young migrant."
141,"It is what it is, just take it for what it is and enjoy the ride. Lilly Collins is good as usual. Views of paris are lovely. Story line is easy going. It's relaxing to watch."
142,Awkward to watch. Truth to the concept but feels fake AF.
143,"This show is trying too hard to be the sex and the city. But turn out nothing similar, it is not funny, the fashion is just so so and the character is the worst.
Nothing natural about Emily, she is so unlikeable, the way she speaks and act around every men just so fake, no one talk like that...
The plot is so predictable and cliche and the character is so shallow."
144,"Was hesitant but I found it quite cute and enjoyable ... if you take their insults of french people lightly.Can't forget the nice eye candy too, just give it a go."
145,After a long time I am seeing rom com which is soo fresh! Enjoyed it thoroughly :)
146,"Loved this series, definitely makes you want to move to another city and seek new opportunities!"
147,"Perfect bingeable show to just relax and enjoy. If you like Younger, you'll love this."
148,"I only watched Collins in Love, Rosie and she was fine in it. She is obviously gorgeous and that's a fact but maybe because I didn't watch her other movies and als thanks to her professionally managed social media and public figure I always thought that she was good at acting. I'm in shock wathing her in Emily in Paris, she is very bad... Very cringy reactions and facial expressions that made me close the series immediately on first episode. These kind of acting and wattpad-like screenplays shouldn't be accepted anymore, it's very tiring and annoying. Don't get me wrong, I love every kind of movie and tv series, last week I finished Selling Sunset and it was horrible but at least I never rolled my eyes ! Those realtors are better actresses than the Great Lily Collins !"
149,"It is just a wholesomely ridiculous and fake American/Disney version of a fictional city that bears absolutely no resemblance to the real Paris.Granted, this kind of creative waste would not matter, and it is pretty much coherent with the show's creator pedigree, were it not for the fact that it misinforms, making people stupid for the sake of ""entertainment"".Contrary to what shows like this tacitly and perversely promote, life does not have to be seen through an instagram filter in order to be worth it of sincere enjoyment and meaning."
150,"Shallow, predicable and boring writen story. Lilly does a great job as actress but the story and characters a so boring and unlikeable. I could not watch more than 2 episodes."
151,"Lily Collins is simply the best, this show brightened up my otherwise horrible day. Can't wait for season 2!"
152,"If you are looking for a pick me up and good mood tv show with no fuss about it, please watch this.
This is really entertaining throughout and there is not a boring minute during the whole show.
Everything is so beautiful, the scenery, the actors, the clothing.
This is a true binge watch and leaves you wanting for a second season."
153,"I have been to Paris several times! This series reflects all the cliches I have experienced! Baguettes, cafés, fashion, arrogance, polite reprimand of 'unacceptable' behaviour, etc. A wonderful series to watch during this time when travel is impossible. Light entertainment serves as a needed distraction from the pandemic!"
154,"So lighthearted, sweet, funny, cute.... We need more shows like these :) As a huge Sex and the City fan, this does NOT disappoint. Lily is very watchable. My least favorite character was Sylvie too over the top for my taste. And not in a good way. When is the next season coming out?"
155,"This show is good for these days when travelling is not a priority for us, we can see very beautiful pictures of Paris and also laugh."
156,"Emily in Paris is a breath of fresh air. I've been having issues in finding good quality binge watching shows and I watched this one in a day! So fun and entertaining! Couldn't stop staring at the screen, Lily Collins shine and the rest of the cast is as incredible! The storyline is not as predictable as one might think. And the Gossip Girl reference was the best!"
157,"Whatever the critic say I still love it, and I think the french stereotype still exists as the same for Americans, It's a fresh breath from this COVID situation and all those gore horror series on Netflix. I don't care I still love it 😍"
158,"This show takes you on a young adult's journey to today's Paris and presents some cultural social contrasts in a nice light way. Lily Collins brought life to a 20-year-old-ish ""basic"" American who speaks in English to everybody while she is in an European city for the first time on a job for marketing of high profile clients. The highlights are her fun and funny experiences: managing work and being an influencer, making friendships and getting involved in a love triangle. That's pretty much what you get. It simply felt like it could have been a movie. Not deep, but enjoyable."
159,"Some might see it as a Sweet guilty pleasure while some may see it as just the right fix in these times. Want so much more, and let Emily and Gabriel be together. Can't wait to see that sparking passion!"
160,"This is by far the worst of Lily Collins. She represents a rude, narcissistic, and shallow American-- a typical know it all Karen. She's not even cute and tries so hard to be cute. Fashion isn't even all that and her marketing strategies are 1/10. An insult to actual marketing and social media people. Should have been finished at season 1! I can't believe that cheating is also the hightlight of this show. She cheated on Camille which is her first real French friend. No more season 2 please.a"
161,Why is it done like it's addressing an audience with zero iq ?
162,Honestly its ridiculous. Cliche. It's got that white American saviour vibe. It's boring. Culturally insensitive. I'm mind blown that it exists.
163,Back to back French cliches. Snore. I hope they don't enable this dated view of the French by ordering a second season. Darren Star should have done a lot better.
164,"Aren't women supposed to support each other? How come she is ""dreaming"" about a happy ending? She is literally falling in love and sleeping with her friend's boyfriend. Is this the role model we want to watch on TV shows? Are we not yet over this cliché? How about strong women who praise true, authentic, transparent, and genuine (girl)friendships over a guy? The most disappointing TV show. I am for more integrity in TV shows as adolescents will grow up thinking this is ""normality"" when the truth is that what Emily does is disgusting."
165,"Stereotypes & clichés? Mehhh...
A simple storyline, a marvelous location and a refreshing vibe."
166,"I was sooo positive impressed with this show. Everything is great here: costumes, actors, story.
This is a great and light serials that I would review once more.
For many years we were waiting for something so good and positive on tv."
167,"EMILY IN PARIS S1 2020AmericanParis will be the dream city of most of us from our childhood. Emily In Paris Is About Emily who works for a large marketing company in Chicago, has been promoted to their Paris branch.With 10 episodes spanning half an hour Each, the show is set entirely in Paris with Paris City as the main character. Therefore, this show is able to give the feeling of Walking Through Paris.Lily Collins performence Was Pretty Good as Emily .This show will be a good treat for Lily Collins fans. There are some cliches and cheese to say the least, but in a positive vibe show like this, it's all inevitable.Emily In Paris is a feel good show that can be seen as going on a tour To Paris7/10"
168,"Emily in Paris ,what a joy . A well acted , well presented movie .It was fun, and brilliant Casting ,characters were such an odd ball bunch I couldn't help but love this movie . As a guy I found it quite refreshing to watch ,compared to my normal fare . I must be mellowing as the years go by .Lily Collins such a promising actress ,and Jean- Christophe playing the designer was such good casting . Set in Paris It was just right. I look forward to a follow up . Take care Bruce"
169,This is a very enjoyable show if you don't take it to seriously. Yes there are a lot of cliches and stereotypes for both the French and American but if you look past that it's really funny and a great way to pass the time.
170,"I enjoyed it. A chick flick, full of cliches, not deep, but fun and entertaining.
I binge watched it while I was feeling sick. I needed something fun that doesn't require much concentration, thinking and analyzing.
It was good and inspiring in general."
171,"Emily in Paris is a fun watch. This comedy-drama is not extraordinary or anything, but it is not at all bad. On one side of this series is the French culture and the beauty of Paris and on the other side is the struggles and adventures of Emily.
Hollywood heartthrob Lily Collins plays the lead character Emily and she does a fair job. She is supported by a good set of actors. The story is kind of average and cliché. In fact, too much cliché at times which has already got the show lots of negative reviews. But it's a fun and light-hearted show. Cinematography, costume and set designing brought out Paris to life, at least for me. Throughout the series, we see some spectacular shots of Paris.
Neither am I an American nor a Parisian, so I won't go to ""that"" debate.
Overall, Emily in Paris could be a fun little way to pass your time. It's light and enjoyable. But yeah, don't expect much.
And, of course, pardon her french!"
172,"Light hearted, escapism at its best! Easy watching and just really enjoyable."
173,Comedy romance!Enjoy to watch and you will not regret watching this.
174,Don't listen to the snobs bashing this show. It is entertaining and Emily is fun to watch.
175,"Show rating- 7/10. Read the caption. NETFLIX'S EMILY IN PARIS is a fun and quirky show that you will enjoy. It is like a dish that you will order basis the fancy name. You are not sure if it is going to be a good choice but you are surprised by the taste and end up enjoying it.The story is simple and straightforward- An American in Paris and her daily struggles while exploring the city and also, herself. The writing works like a little magic where we see believable characters and acting by everyone. Now, that is something to cherish as you always have this problem of watching some silly things with shows like this. Another good thing is the way they tell you these small but interesting things about French people and their likes and dislikes. May sound too harsh but it is a fun commentary with an American point of view.The pace is just right. Nothing looks like a drag or rush job. I think that worked for me where I was not sure about the show but started enjoying the characters and the pace of the show.The problem is with the main lead Emily. Her dressing style is a turn-off. You can call me a fashion-illiterate but it is too silly for me. Plus, her cringey smile as it looks fake at times. Another problem is the way they show the whole social media scene. It is like you just take pictures in Paris and you are an influencer! Trust me if it is that easy to be an influencer then everyone is famous. Further, things solve easily for Emily and that looks unreal. Wanted to see some struggle for real.All said and done...The show is enjoyable. Simple and easy to watch. Waiting for season 2, Netflix!"
176,Really liked the show and the use of French. Beautiful men.
177,"I thought it was great! Yes there are stereotypes in the show but I found them more about the fashion and luxury brand industry then actual cultures! (apart from the Chinese ones). Mindy is a great character though!
Don't shy away because of negative reviews please watch for yourself!
If you enjoyed any shows like gossip girl or sex and the city I really think you will like this."
178,"Indeed the story is far away from real life and the real Paris... but guys it is just a series! Thats the purpose of it, you want to watch it and keep dreaming about traveling etc.. Like Is anything from sex and the city like this in real life? But people loved it because when you chill in your sofa you want to escape from life issues and just relax!Emily in Paris definitely gave me those chills and cannot wait for season 2!"
179,"I am feeling generous so I am giving it a solid 6. This is a good watch if you have nothing better to do and want to get the feeling of being in Paris. My quip with it is that it starts out well intentioned but then gets into stereotyping real quick. In its favour I felt that both sides were made fun of a bit so that showed it had potential but then they continued to exploit the french person stereotype so much that the whole show became about it. I have been to France and I'd say I have had better experiences in France with strangers than in America Overall. So that's that. The show is flimsy, the pursuits of fame, materialism, approval and likeability sound rather vacuous to me. Its represents the world romanticising and expecting too much from Paris as if its Disney world and not a real city for humans to live in. Quite tired of that. I saw this because of Lilly Collins. She is refreshing and fun to watch and so are all the other performers in this show. The premise of the show and the general storyline are responsible for making it kinda basic."
180,"Sometimes it's nice to just sit back and be entertained. Isn't that sort of the French way? I mean why stress out over something when you can just enjoy it. Emily in Paris is like a perfect chocolate croissant. Yummy Paris, wardrobe, characters, and fun. What a lovely distraction from the current state of the world."
181,"It's not supposed to be the greatest TV show in the history, it's supposed to make you fall in love with Paris, to just think ""awww"" and relax.
And it just does that. Lily Collins is the perfect star, she's just gorgeous and adorable.
Yes, the show has clichés, it's showing only nice things and it's very American. So what? Just sit back and enjoy!"
182,"My whole house is Hooked!!!
We Love Emily!!!!
Fantastic writing, string female characters, incredible fashion!!!!"
183,"Loved the music, the clothes, the food, and the great shots of Paris. Colorful and playful show worth every lock down minute. Yes there is French clique but that's what sells Paris isn't it . I binged the series in one night and wished I was there eating croissants and drinking coffee for breakfast."
184,"Emily in Paris is beautiful, endearing, and down-right hilarious. It gives you everything you'd ever want from a chic book but with wonderful actors and gorgeous scenery. It does a really good job of bringing you into Emily's world and I can't get enough of this show. Seriously! I don't get all the hate! (Well, I do but this show really doesn't deserve it. Just give it a chance!)"
185,Yes it is full of cliches but it is a fun and pleasant show to watch. I watched the whole season in one day. The only thing I found offensive is that French people are somehow promiscuous?
186,"Lily, is perfect for the role.
I can not wait for the second season!👏"
187,"There were more things that I really liked in this TV show: especially the style, the tempo..it was very funny that I usually missed from new comedies and this is the genre, so we like or not like.I can't agree with every marketing ideas that comes from Emily, because there were some that to much and unlikely for me.I think despite the clichés, our bain's need this emotion, that other dramas can't give it.Just enjoy!"
188,"I am a foreigner who took the french nationality in Paris. Too much of american stereotypes, some of them true, but still overexagerated. No wonder why americans in Paris are a population on their own, never took the time to really understand why others are different."
189,"A wonderfully needed distraction during this depressing covid era, with the SATC vibe I have so missed!!! I have missed light shows like this that let you turn off your brain and just enjoy the scenery, outfits and fun storylines.... Paris looks as good as always and the show takes pokes at the French, the Americans, influencers and everything else at times.... I definitely hope there will be more seasons."
190,It is funny that parisians were offended and specifically complained that the show treated Paris like an amusement park especially since the stereotypically pessimistic french woman character says exactly the same thing in the show. Paris is a major tourist destination - what do they expect?I enjoyed this playful romp - like visiting Paris from my couch. Comfort viewing at its best. Délicieuse!
191,"I have lived in France for the last 18 years, and I laughed affectionately at so many parts of this series, because I recognized things I have experienced and have seen many times.
This series is not meant to be a serious analysis of America and France, and I believe many people leave negative reviews because they expect it to be. The series has a great sense of humour, and it celebrates French culture with humour and admiration at the same time. I really recommend! It's a light-hearted and fun watch."
192,"Listen, this is not a Big Little Lies. Nor is it (yet) Sex and the City. But it is nice escapism. Perhaps for a bit younger audience than Sex and the City was for but I have to say the last couple of episodes felt a bit more adult: the jokes etc. Does it give a realistic view of Paris? No. Does it perpetuate a clichéd Hollywood view of Paris? Perhaps, yes. But does it matter? It is not pretending to be something else. And in between the clichéd lines there is some truth about Paris: the French, the houses, restaurant life, au pairs in the city, the French attitude towards relationships. All exaggerated and not like with nuance, but still. We, well I, need some escapism. The thing what makes these series so good is that every actor delivers. All the supporting roles are very well acted. It is well directed and it seems like every actor is having fun and feels respected and has some space to shine, to show their talents. This sense of fun, and of respect translates to the viewer. That makes it really nice to watch."
193,"Very much enjoyed this show. Great views of Paris.Thanks to Netflix for creating such a binge worthy romcom! Funny sexual innuendo's, romantic and charming.The attraction and tension between Emily and Gabriel was so well put into play that it deserves an applaud.The show captures romance and travel in a delightful way.Hope there will be a Season 2 soon!!
Merci beaucoup Netflix"
194,"I was not that tempted at first however my friend convinced me. Loved it!!!! It is such a cute, funny, positive and easy to watch series."
195,"Love the images of Paris!
Can't say is awesome but it was very enterteined"
196,"I started watching it without listening, just because I miss Paris but I was quickly hooked and binged on the whole season at once. Looking forward to the next series."
197,Loving this hope they do more seasons it's quite addictive
198,Very sweet and clever written. Everything looks so nice. Very funny and smart. And Lily Collins is just such a great Actress.
199,Easy to watch lots of fun very cute just watch it don't overthink it Guys!
200,"I've always wanted to go to Paris and this show tells how about how you should learn the French language if you're going to Paris, how u shouldn't be ignorant if you're new to a place, and how you should never give up. I don't wanna give any spoilers but I would recommend. It's fun to watch and I can't wait for s2"
201,"Lovely Emily in Paris!!!
I am looking forward to the arrival of the 2nd season."
202,"I was hesitant about watching this , I thought that it would be another sappy, boring , giggling female tv series, it's quite the opposite, really great show!!, and I'm glad that I am binging it, I don't want to stop the flow of excitement. I love all of the women outfits, shoes, and accessories. It almost makes you feel like you're in Paris."
203,"What the show does well:
Fashion! Paris! Really funny French guys in the PR firm.Where the show kind of sucks: Emily. Oh my, how I don't like the character. Such an American cliché, pronounces all the French names consequently English, is so full of her self. No no no.There is one special highlight in the series and that's the beautiful and nice French guy living next to her ;-)I watched it because I love Paris and once there was a story around Gabriel, I was hooked. And I will watch another season, yes."
204,"It's glamorous, full of bad acting, lacks any depth, very easy on the eyes, an assault on your cringe senses at times. It features so much of Paris, it's watchable just for the good scenes and clothes. Watch it if you want a series to just pass time."
205,It was so typical and the story was sooooo predictable.
206,"Ugh. We've already seen Carrie Bradshaw go to Paris and it was painful then.Why do creators STILL rely on the the stereotypes from years ago about the French? And the stereotypes of Americans interacting with the French?Darren Starr's antiquated vision of the female protagonist has, in and of itself, become a trope. The writing needs to improve exponentially if this thing can survive.You know what would have been a way better concept? If they had sent Kate Walsh and skipped all the trope nonsense. An accomplished woman making her way in Paris and coping with nuance would have been a winner. Chances missed!But... it was wonderful seeing Paris filmed beautifully and that's the only reason I'm giving it three stars. Nice production values."
207,"This ""project"" should have been left in the late nineties where it belongs. Not only does the show enforce every known stereotype, it shoves them down your throat."
208,Binge watched the whole 1st season. It was pretty awful. Lily Collins is a b grade actress at best - too much eye rolling and her character is very 2 dimensional. And every man she meets instantly falls in love with her (or so she thinks). As my husband described her ... she's just annoying. The costars are much better actors. The plot is suited to Mills and Boone novel. I'd give it a 2 stars (mainly for the nice scenery).
209,"Cliché after cliché after cliché... By the middle of the season it's not fun anymore, and by the end of the season it feels plainly disrespectful towards French culture. I can't deny it was entertaining, but I FELT I WAS WATCHING A CARTOON! Depiction of such a complex culture like the French, and particularly Parisian history, traditions and customs, with RIDICULOUS STEREOTYPES, almost felt insulting... and I'm not even French! But I'd hate if a TV Series mocked my country/city like that."
210,"Emily in Paris is a high fantasy imagining of a young woman's year in Paris. I think halfway through I cottoned on to the fact that it isn't meant to reflect reality, which made it slightly easier to watch. That being said, it's still a struggle to watch. I paused and came back to the first episode alone six times. The biggest problem (for me) is that for a glitzy escapist fantasy, it didn't succeed in suspending reality. I kept snapping out of it and going, ""Yeah, that's so unrealistic"" or ""Wow, that is so inaccurate and offensive."" I mean, even random background French characters are walking around speaking in English. Come oooon.I have a soft spot for Lily Collins, which is why I really tried to like this. But her character--and everyone else, really--is written as a stereotype. Hers is ""obnoxious Gen-Z gauche American"" living every French fantasy the writers could cough up. It's like it was written by people who (a) have never been to Paris and just dreamed every aspect of it up; or (b) people who have been, and for some reason took nothing from the stay.I can see how this might appeal to a certain market, but wow is the pandering laid on thick. It made it wholly unenjoyable for me."
211,"This show exemplifies everything that is vapid about our world nowadays. A girl with her cell phone that speaks no French is able to make a huge career of being an influencer in Paris just because she takes selfies of herself? Sigh. I watched all of it hoping it would get better but it just didn't.Character Development: 1
Wardrobe: 4 (although I would've rated higher for reusing her wardrobe since she lives in a small apartment & supposedly doesn't have much money)
American Acting: 2
French Acting: 7
Writing: 2
Setting: 8"
212,"I so wanted to like this, but no, it's like watching a parody of Sex And The City mixed with The Devil Wears Prada. Most of the acting is so bad and so is the plot. Totaly unrealistic and almost mocking of european culture. I so NOT hope for another season - ever."
213,"I don't know if it's the music, the dialogues, the fashion or the editing but this is just hard to watch... the way they incorporated IG and technology just doesn't work for me, reminds me of that Black Mirror episode with the girl that desperately needed likes.
I love Lily and feel kind of bad for her... Just wish they'd made this show more sophisticated, funny, witty and less childish."
214,I loved watching this series. It makes me want to move to Paris and explore this beautiful city
215,"The funny part is that I read the other reviews and found that most foreigners rated this show as awful, whereas I saw quite a few Frenchies raving about it.Yes it is full of cliché. Yes it is a bit much sometimes. Yes it is quite improbable overall. But there is full of well thought details and there is truth in each of them.It is ""jubilatoire"" to see all our contradictions being outed like this. I observe them myself all the more that I am now leaving abroad and able to observe them with a fresh point of view whenever I'am back.NB: Only mistakes made by the writer, the French in the movie are making too much efforts to speak French when Emily is around. In real life, american friends, be ready to have many more ""grands moments de solitude"" :p."
216,"Here in Paris, we think this is really funny show, all clichés are presents.
A beret, the chardonnay at 11h, the crème brûlée, the firstname Laurent not given to someone since the 80´s, taxis, baguette, the shops not opened at 10:30.
Negative point : we complete our own bingo card after only one episode"
217,... actors are pretty to look at ... city being Paris we-all-know is-special ... there's little-to-praise regarding an-unremarkable-script ... episodes are shorter so that's a big-help-relief... would there be much reason for excitement over a second-season ... sure as our world suffers through some of the worst times in a century ... escape is helpful..??
218,"I watched it all in 1 sitting. The story is interesting and refreshing. Dialogue is light but funny. Some of the european to USA quirks were amplified with a fun twists.Music was also eclectic and casual. I loved the french version of 'these boots are made for walking'. The cinematography was well done as well. Night lighting was natural and just puts you in the mood. And, lastly, I am not usually a fan of 30 minute episodes, but here they were perfect; not too long, no too short, which means the editing was spot on.Oh, yeah, I do have to say, I am usually not into the clothes or fashion, but her outfits stole the show. Whoever envisioned it, really killed it.I really enjoyed it, lets hope season 2 will come soon."
219,A great introduction to the culture in Paris! Lilly Collins picks up the most delightful scripts. A feel good series with great fashion and smouldering hunks!
220,"This show is lite, fun and enjoyable its a must watch you will dive in a stress free hours while simultaneously falling in love with paris and the show."
221,"So rude, so loud, maybe that's the impression that the Americans are giving to the French when this show is showing all the ""cliche"" about Paris, about French.Nothing against Lily, but on the other hand, Emily, it's almost like a disaster.What really triggers my was ep3, yes I'm still watching and on the balcony there was Emily and Fabian, and she couldn't even get the pronunciation of ""travail"" right even though Fabian just said it TWICE.Let along all the American French ""Tres bien"" ""Merci beaucoup"" I mean really? For crying out loud Emily you're having French class can you at least TRY TO GET IT RIGHT?I'm not French, but I'm a French speaker therefore I know it's not rocket science to get a proper accent; and this is just really rubbing me the wrong way.TRY HARDER NEXT TIME NETFLIX."
222,This girl is a little annoying..no a lot. It's very hard to watch.
223,"An immature protagonist & an unlikeable cast. There isn't a single character that I was rooting for. Emily's clothes were too much like a costume. I hoped some of that mythical French women fashion would rub off on her, but alas was disappointed. I'll rewatch SATC for fashion & Amelie for French quirkiness"
224,"A few hours to get your mind off Covid? Sure, it's light and somewhat interesting. And while I don't need every show I watch to be 100% culturally accurate, this falls completely flat. I thought we would begin moving past tired stereotypes and clichés. The main character is insufferable in her own right, and seems to find non-english speaking Parisians to be the problem.If you're looking for a fluff piece, watch it. If you want to watch something culturally relevant, void of cliches and stereotypes, and halfway interesting... Look elsewhere"
225,I have no idea how this is getting high reviews. It is filled with stereotypes and cliches. Are people giving it high ratings because of Lily Collins? Guess we'll never know.
226,"To be fair, having abandoned this two thirds of the way through episode one, I'm not really giving it a fair chance. To be (in my mind) equally fair, I'm in no way convinced that it deserves one. There are many ""Netflix Originals"" that are in some way flawed despite high production values, but mostly they have some appeal: likeable characters; difficult scenarios; controversial social commentary; etc. This one, not so much. It's like the writers watched ""Au Service de la France"" and ""The Good Place"" and ""Ugly Betty"" and consistently missed the point."
227,"Another American show on French bashing. France is Paris, all French are mean. Why to dare going beyond the stereotypes when clichés are so easy? Disgusting. Plot is terrible and acting avarage. Don't waist your time on this show, not woorth it."
228,"Emily in Paris is stylish and fun. It's exactly how I, who has never been to Paris, pictures it going if I moved on a whim. Well, except I'd have a lot more wine in hand! Collins is selling the part!"
229,"Managed to see 5 episodes and just because most of my friends recommended it and was encouraging me to finish it. Obviously, I won't do that.The show is really shallow, unrealistic and so cringy. The main actress is terrible! I don't know why people loved this series. My guess would be the filming location."
230,"This could have been a great show, if she didn't ride everything with a pulse, and stopped complaining about the male gaze and whatnot all the time. Netflix has really become a bad joke."
231,"3 boring cliches (I guess there are always new customers for them)""-two snotty cultures duelling it out.-A made up conflict between old vagina and new vagina. hmm I wonder who wrote that.-boring old influencer wanna be.
This is the equivalent of a Christmas romcom. It will be good pap for some but not even escapist pleasure for most."
232,"It's an easy show to watch, very lighthearted and fun, but it is also very predictable. It doesn't add anything new to the table, and it's quite cliché in the way it represents American and the French.I know I'll watch the whole season, but I just wish it had something more to it.Cinematography is really nice, and the music and costumes too. Emily's character is very often bland, though. Lily Collins acting saves the character."
233,"Great if you're looking for an easy going and feel good show to watch!Beautiful cast, literally.. really nice looking people, the plot is not something unique or new but the freshness and beauty of Paris views CAN NEVER DO YOU WRONG.The plot is simple and ok and pretty fast so overall pretty good!It got me inspired to travel, and obviously to visit Paris."
234,"The main problem with this series is the lead character...charmless, bland, social media obsessed and annoying. Then there are the clichés: Beret's, Baguettes,Bidets yada yada. The Paris depicted is picture postcard perfect at all times & therefore a fake Paris without grit.
You'd be better off watching Allo Allo , a lot more fun than this tosh."
235,"Everything is plastic in this show, plus such an amount of clichés is borderline racistAlso, why does Emily smiles that much, this is definitively more a sign of a mental condition than enthusiasm"
236,"This series may to appear as light and fun à la Sex and the City, but it's not.
It's an insult to Parisians and to Americans.
1. It is an insult to Parisians because it is stuffed full of every cliche/ stereotype that one would expect from people that have no knowledge and interest in Europe and Paris. It just shows, what dumb people expect and want to see confirmed.
2. It is an insult to Americans, because it refects very poorlly on the origin and cause of this series.
If you can think just a little bit, you'll have to cringe constantly in second hand embarrassment. If not and someone finds this so romantic or it's all the same, light entertainment, this series has successfully held up the mirror to this person. If this person understands that, is a different question.I guess... in this sense the existence of this series has value after all."
237,"I don't remember disliking any American TV show as much as I disliked this one. In the show, French coworkers or designer suddenly liking and supporting her without much reasons, wasn't convincing to me, or why would beautiful French lady-girlfriend of the neighbour be so enthusiastic to be her friend . Emily, not having any genuine reaction when her American boyfriend broke up with her, or not having any self-restraint before making a decision to sleep with someone, or being in love with a neighbour and still dating another guy grosses me out. I didn't like her as a actress either, most of the time her reactions were fake, she almost always had the same facial expressions . There are lots of beautiful people, extravagant yet sophisticated clothes, images of breathtaking city which must be the major reason of success of this TV show."
238,"An American show set in Paris, not to be confused with a French show. The plot is a little crude and obvious, the characters are very cliched but there is enough sense of humour in it to land it four stars.
Only watch it if you've really short for other entertainment."
239,"Binged it with my roomates to hate on it, and I wasn't let down. There's no plot and the only thing that resembles a plot is everyone being mean, in order to shake up a status quo. Every guy wants to do Emily/every girl either hates or loves her, and all justify their behaviour using fake ""French arguments"".
Bonus point for the Vincent Desagnat lookalike thought."
240,"I have watched the whole season in 2 days. I like girly stuff but Emily in Paris is too much. You have made Emily very sweet and innocent and yet a b**ch. She want it all. Her friendship with Camille - Oh come on! Emily is very evil, she don't deserve to have Camille for a friend.
Camille is very sweet, suportive girlfriend and friend. Gabriel is also a jack*ss. Hot jack*ss.Emily - .- leaves her boyfriend to pursuit a career (ok, they made him a jack*ss) and distroys another relationship, flirt with all the man in the show except ""Marv"" Luc and Julian.And the FASHION. Dear God. (Only Em)The only good thing was the yellow dress, power shuting off and one quote from Gabriel.3/10"
241,"Omg this sucks not queer enough
Nobody needs another show with white and straight people
Come on"
242,"Why give the main girl a cheating storyline? Those plots are for side characters in a show like this. It's hard to be likeable if you cheat. And it's never okay despite how great you think the love story is. But this show is like an escape. Living a fantasy. I've been to Paris and lived it. The people are horrible if you don't speak Parisian French. Also where are the tourists in the show? There's always tourists everywhere! Lily Collins is lovely but she's lost so much weight it's uncomfortable to watch. She looks like a child dating much older men. Her clothes aren't the best either. SATC fashion is much better than this. Hell, even her Asian friend has better style. she claims she cant afford some things and yet she wears Chanel a lot. Okaaayyy. I wouldn't mind a season 2 but this show has a lot to fix."
243,"It's more like a kids tv show,bit shallow and can pretty much predict the end from first episode; and shipping peanut butter from US...
and no, paris is not flooded with good looking guys on the street."
244,"So much garbage in this movie, if they would recycle it, they would save the planet!"
245,"Emily is an annoying character always that is over enthusiasm, is she ever sad? A typical american girl with that foolish instagram who likes to over react and try too hard. I stopped after the first episode. It was just too much for me.."
246,"I forced myself to SUFFER through 5 episodes.I was hopeful that it would get better.Guess what???????It DID NOT!!!!There are so many things and inconsistencies wrong with this show.Darren Star should be embarrassed having his name associated with this show. I'm guessing Candice was the creative brains in previous collaborations. ""just saying"".If anyone watches this all the way through. You were warned it is BAD!!!!!I sincerely hope that it will NOT be extended for a second season.Nothing against the actors, they done their best with a bad script."
247,"I stopped at episode 2, I just couldn't take any more cliches and cheesy lines. This type of series would have been acceptable in 2017 but it's far too stereotypical, cringey and not funny at all. I absolutely hate the american/french duality of this. Emily has the personality of a stick and that's it. Typical american girl who comes in Europe. How she forgets each time where her apartment is and ends up at a model looking guy's flat, i mean please. The dialogues are so cringe, I get secondhand embarrassment from them to be honest. Don't watch if you're actually looking to watch something decent."
248,Is Emily going to do something else in Paris other than sleep with every man she meets..?
249,"I think this is the kind of comedy that the Star do Just because she has extra money to produce it and wants to wear pretty clothes. But seriously... It has no poetry to be a sitcom that takes place in Paris. I respect Lily Collins previous work, but her character is superficial, stupid and has no complex. It's pretty plane. So sorry."
250,Shows like these are what our current and future generations are/will be inspired by? You do realize they want to profit from white people?Lol women watch shows like these and want to make their life like a movie and just give guys a headache while doing it.Shows like these are cringe and just need to stop.
251,Who has eyebrows like that? She reminds me of the chick (lady in red) in dodgeball.
252,"Emily in Paris is everything you could hate of a show. Is cliche, is overly positive and is all about the ""American point of view"" if the intention of the movie was to create such a cheesy show of course they did a great job but the styling could have been more modern and less 2007. Its all about the fashion and that wasn't seen at all."
253,"Full of cliché and stereotypes. A shallow combination of many old movies and scripts.
The show is mainly for todays teenagers who uses social media with a dream of being an influencer.
Just another movie/show promotes the Paris obsession of Americans."
254,"It is just so offensive, jam packed with the worst stereotypes and the lead character is beyond nauseating although acted competently. Am I supposed to be willing on her unceremonious dumping in the Champs Elysee? The Sylvie character shows promise but only because the actress is able to fashion something watchable from the script which is to be honest a huge achievement. What a shame, I was looking forward to this, Paris looks beautiful and it promised to be some much needed escapism but it's just very, very bad and goes on as predictably as I feared from the first episode to the last."
255,"I was expecting a light show with some romance and comedy, nothing more, however I ended up being disappointed for wasting my time:
1. Outdated use of stereotypes. Please, stop with narratives like ""hate from French towards people from the U.S.""
2. Most of the outfits are so unrealistic and tasteless. It was TOO MUCH at the same time. Seemed like Kate Spade vibes on steroids and not in a good way.
3. 85% of the time it was cringe, 15% bearable. What does Emily has to do with a minor?!
4. The only pro was the filming locations which show the nice and touristic sights in Paris but definitely does not capture the essence of the city as a whole. Paris is much more than the Seine.In overall it wasn't pleasant and won't be watching season 2. Spend your valuable time in something else like Queen's Gambit (better outfits, original story and much more entertaining)."
256,"If you are watching this programme to learn about Paris, and France, please don't. Having lived there for a year and visited at least once a year since I was a teenager, the hyperbole is literally insane. However, if you are looking for a lighthearted escapism from todays doom and gloom, it fits the brief. Snazzy outfits, beautiful faces, fast paced storylines, etc, its entertaining, and watchable."
257,"What a stupid and pointless show. I like romcoms as much as the next girl, but this one is so lame and immature.
The main protagonist is annoying and thinks she owns the world. In the real world, the ideas she suggests wouldn't hold water anywhere.
The whole Paris setting is exaggerated and false. Paris isn't the way it's shown in the show. People aren't like that. It's so heavily Americanized , only American people will like this.Terrible characters too, no depth and no background being explored. The acting is sub-par and the only reason I tried it was the rating here. It's not even worth a 5 on 10."
258,Remind me when was this show shot? 20 years ago? Because I can't see any no go zones there. No Africans and Arabs there. And Paris is full of them. It's a miracle there are none of them. And that's why it is pretentious garbage. The three stars are for the depiction of French snobbery.
259,"The main character is annoying , entitled and caricatured , basically every characters in this show is 2 dimensional and caricatured . Even the real 2D animation doesn't do such things anymore .
So dumb"
260,"Why I need to see it exactly? For the pure costume, discount plot and dozens of stereotypes about France, fashion/SMM/actually working in some hi-class corporation - if u into tacky things, maybe u kinda can check it, but meh..Disappointing."
261,"Terrible show.
I think Emily's IQ is like 10
The description pf french people is terrible (and I'm not french!)
The screenplay... 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
One of the worst show on Netflix and the worst show of the year"
262,"Lily Collins is terrible as Emily. I'm sure it didn't help that the script was bad to begin with but the acting was awful! Typical stereotype of the ugly American in the character of Emily. She doesn't prepare for her Parisian placement by attempting to learn French and the few phrases she does pick up are delivered with a bad, campy American accent. This is just one of the examples of her American cultural insensitivity, ignorance and arrogance. Very unrealistically is entrusted with such an important account at the marketing firm where she works. She arrives with her prudish American morality to cast a glance askance at her Parisian work mates, while sashaying around the office in wildly inappropriate clothes, short shorts, stilettos, minis and off the shoulder dresses adorning her pre-pubescent, Lolita physique. It is a chick flick for American 14 year old's or millennials pushing the ""influencer"" tag the whole time. A what not to do chronicle for American youth when traveling abroad. Enjoy all the beautiful shots of this illustrious city, if nothing else."
263,"This show is the worst I've seen in a while. Seriously, you can say it's a love letter to Paris? Give me a brake! It's not only a silly, superfluous and totally out of reality of what the city is today (and its inhabitants for that matter), it's insulting to it.
Please, do yourself a favor and don't expect to find ""that"" Paris if you go to visit the real one because you will get horribly disappointed. It doesn't compare to the portrait of NYC that ""Sex in the city"" made. This is different. This is just plain out of wack.
Regarding the rest of the characters, the ""human ones"", the show does the same service: cliche, stereotypical, superfluous, silly, nonsensical, portrait of false people.
Sham of show. Totally forgettable."
264,"I was skeptical about watching this after reading so many bad reviews, but I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it and ended up binge watching it in 2 days! It's just a fun, light watch and I love the story, fashion, romance, and seeing all the beautiful Paris' sights 😊"
265,"I've really tried to watch the show 3 times. At the first two times, I gave up after 5 mins. Third time, I managed to watch for 10 mins. That is it. For the sake of my brain, not going to try it again. I am a fan of SATC ( only the TV show, not the movie). There is no wisdom in this TV drama, jokes a bit dry. It just about all the men are fascinated by this young American girl who dressed horribly. Neither the story, nor the outfits attracts me to watch this show."
266,"It's a show that *could* be deep and look at some real issues, but it sidesteps that to drool at hot guys. It tries to be the next Sex and the City, but it barely hits the level of a CW show. (And not a good one like Gossip Girl. A crappy one like Reign.)
It was also pretty annoyingly lazy that they don't progress Emily during the time she's in Paris - you dont see her speaking any more French, dressing more according to french styles, or being homesick."
267,"Lily Collins is a very pretty woman in a very lovely city. But that's about all that is good with this tv series. Very little laughs and obnoxious shallow characters are an integral part of this RomCom or should I just say Rom---. The cinematography is good and clever but unfortunately the comedic writing rarely gets as much as a grin.This series seems to be targeted to gen-z teen female, social media ninjas and the few biological males that want to be just like them. Watch the first episode. Just know it does not get any better the more you watch."
268,"MY OPINION : i liked it is fun light cheesy series you will enjoy it especially the ladies, but i mean they made the French people 🇫🇷 look so bad i hated that, why? they didn't have to. I recommend it"
269,"And the first cliché of all, it's the main character: enthusiastic, who don't know people and language but make love with almost every boy she has met (But I guess this last one is a Darren Starr trademark). Of course, there's a lot more clichés about France : all buildings are from Haussmann era, people arrive so late at work and it's so hard to fire them (believe me, it's not).
Apart these points (but these are majors concerns) or maybe because of it, this show is viewable, but the action didn't make you holding your breath..."
270,"Lily Collins is the reason it caught my attention. And then came Lucas Bravo. It's a fun, no-brains story, with beautiful cinematography in the always amazing Paris, plus some great outfits - and I don't necessarily mean Emily's, but Sylvie's. However, Emily behaves like a frivolous Alice in Wonderland, she isn't a good match with Gabriel and their intimate scenes lack passion and realism. So much lost potential and a superficial, unrealistic, full of clichés American rom-com scenario. Still, a light hearted watch to switch off your brain, probably best suited for young girls.PS: It's 2020. Time for the gorgeous-nice-guy stereotype to wake up and stop being a prop already!"
271,"It's one of those kind of shows where you don't hate it but you don't absolutely love it. The story line was pretty ""basic"" --not a spoiler but if you watched it you get it.- you get the new girl in a new city type of thing. Who doesn't like an escape in that type of show?
The actors and actresses were fantastic! The main girl felt a little ""meh"" but maybe that's just her character?
There's parts where I'm like OH YEAH YOU GO GIRL and other parts where I'm like OH NO HONEY WHY..
Yes I finished the show, and yes I would watch the next season if there will be one. It wasn't my favorite shows but it still caught my attention."
272,Do you want to travel to Paris without living your couch? Do you want to virtually taste French food and see a collection of really hot guys? Watch Emily in Paris. I cannot wait for Season 2! It reminds me of Sex and the city and Lipstick Jungle. Easy for binge watching in on a Saturday.
273,It is cliche but somehow it fits my type of humor.
274,This is a brilliant show. I don't understand why this has such low rating. People are so wierd now adays. Smh!
275,I know there's hate about the French cliche but I didn't mind this show and it has potential to be a really good show.
276,"I am a fan of Lily Collins, so I tuned in to watch Emily in Paris.The series seems to be geared toward a younger crowd, and if you take it on that basis, you may enjoy it.The production values good. This is light fare as Lily takes a job in Paris and tries to maneuver in a new culture. What she encounters is a pretty cliched version of Paris: cold people, men with mistresses that their wives know about, lots of guys chasing after a beautiful woman.I have a feeling that we're going to be seeing a lot more of this type of show - something you don't have to cry during or think about too much, and something pretty too look at. At the moment, that's what people want in entertainment; at the moment, the world is pretty dreary. Anyway, take it for what it is."
277,"This is basically a show where boring, unlikable, superficial people navigate around the worst clichés about Paris. Paris is pictured as this magical place where nothing bad ever happens, where you can show up from nowhere, do the bare minimum and get high fives all around for being such a wonderful human being. The rest of France is either ignored, or pictured at best as an amusement park for clueless tourists, and at worst as a place where reject go to die. The closest thing to a villain in this story is the one who sees through Emily's bluff, of course. Every 5 minutes Emily is shown posting vapid pictures on her Instagram, with of course a (fairly unrealistic) follow count in the background. It doesn't serve any purpose other than to offer a couple of cheap secondary plot devices, and to make Emily extra #relatable of course - even Emily herself does not seem to care much about it. The show occasionally co-opts feminist language to press hard-hitting issues like nudity in advertising, but I guess if in your universe your average 20-something working woman has a life as good as Emily, that's gotta be one of the main issues of the day.In the end, this was just boring and predictable enough to work as white noise while working on other stuff, so I'm giving it 2/10. The best joke of the show was the way it managed to get a second season so easily. Thanks, Netflix, and thanks, Emily in Paris. I guess miracles do happen."
278,"Very hard to watch, after 10 minutes in I felt like I had been watching for 1 hour.
What is this thing with not wanting to learn other language than American in the states?
Don't give the series 10 stars if it's not a 10 star series."
279,"More than 85% of the world's population understand English. too much of french fries, cant digest. stopped, after watching half of the first episode."
280,This show was full of cliches. It also made European people seem like small-minded compared to Americans.
281,"I'm scared about the messages this show provides towards romance, what a ""perfect job"" is like, and how you're supposed to live your life. It speaks from this privileged woman point of view with not much quality content nor relatableness. Young girls are going to watch this and think they want to be like emily, when in reality that's not a standard anyone should chase. Sure, she has money, she's white, tall, skinny and exceptionally beautiful... she can travel and afford to be a dreamer social media obsessed ""influencer""... however! it does really bug me she is messing with other's relationships! she doesn't have clear and healthy boundaries! she is so disconsiderate for others' wishes, cultures or ideas! she doesn't have a single relationship that feels genuine. Is it really realistic she meets suddenly her best (asian for diversity purposes) friend in a park bench? why we don't see more of her instead? why she's only around all day to talk, lunch and check emily's social media? isn't she supposed to be working or.. living a life? i think her best friend was more interesting than this caricature phony cardboard ""emily"" character. I know people in the us can be SO fake but this went overboard with our protagonist. I'd like to have seen a real woman, who feels things, who fights for things, who struggles, who has clear boundaries, who doesn't mess with others' relationships, who has emotional intelligence, who is realistic. In here, she's no longer a human being, she's something people with no context, enough age, education or criteria can see as ""goalz"" while everyone else cringes in their seat wondering: ""why did I put this on netflix?""Like someone before pointed, every actor / actress in here is reading his/her lines throughout the whole thing like their soul has been stripped out, because they are aware this is just easy ca$h. Every person is literally so fake, one dimensional, plain, boring and stupid, I was wondering: ""wth I'm watching? where are the background laughs for their amazingly bland performances? oh... they aren't joking?""Again, I'd like to point that I hate the story revolves around her chasing a non-available guy, and it's framed here in this tv show as ""flirting"" and ""seduction""... this just doesn't translate well to real life scenarios. It's a lie, people. Consent IS sexy af. Kissing without permission to your neighbor is not cool. If this were on the other way around MAYBE everyone else would see how problematic this whole narrative is.And... where are the strong female characters? why do we have this boring, old, outdated b**tch boss trope? where's sorority and real, profoundly transformative feminism?? (that supposedly emily fights for in an episode, but then goes and tries to hit on her friend's boyfriend?) this s*** was clearly written by someone who doesn't understand many things about today's world, what a good standard of living is, and see beyond the superficiality, banality, lameness and fantasies of an influencer."
282,"And Gossip Girl's daughter. Speaking of Gossip Girl, there is a major spoiler near the end of Ep.6, so if GG is still on your ""To-Watch"" list and you're anti-spoiler, just giving you a head's up.Emily in Paris is everything I expected it to be, and it's good and it's bad. It's good because I can just curl up in bed, indulge and binge-watch it because it checks all my boxes; it's bad because the show is fairly predictable. I feel like the show's creators just grabbed all the stereotypical Parisian things it could find and tossed it in a pot et--Voila!--we have season 1. It's a nice excuse to display the most popular French songs and wear chic clothes, though, so I'm not complaining.The show overall is amusing to watch and I do enjoy living vicariously through Emily. It's like reading my favourite chick-lit and having a huge grin on my face the entire time. What I will say that I didn't really like is the acting because sometimes it was a tad exaggerated. Lily Collins' portrayal was a hit and miss for me, but ultimately she was Emily and owned her role. The biggest stand out for me was the actress who played her boss. She gave Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada a run for her money. I thought she was such a natural--a natural female dog. Loved it. I also adored the small guest appearance from Victor Meutelet who I've had a huge crush on since The Bonfire of Destiny. Also, the main guy is HOT. I definitely cannot take the heat, so I need to get out of his kitchen.I didn't particularly like Emily sleeping around, but I guess people do, do that in real life, and like grandmother (SATC) and mother (GG), like granddaughter and daughter...c'est la vie haha. I can't put my finger on it, but show somehow felt disrespectful to the Parisian culture...but I'm just here for the fantasy of it...the show does get funnier and finds it groove near the end of the season. It's not outstanding or groundbreaking by any means, but it's still feel-good and entertaining."
283,If you loved Sex in the City like I did you know is not just the characters or situations is about the look and feel the places the dresses. Having Paris as the backdrop makes me want to watch even more. Lets say I enjoy the visuals and the romance is the icing in this cup cake.
284,"As a huge fan of SATC and Younger and I mean HUGE fan, I really wanted to love this. I was excited for this to come out, but sadly it fell flat for me. Lily Collins's performance was surprisingly a bit caricature and her portrayal of Emily was cringeworthy type of cheesy most of the time, instead of endearing. There's something off. Also, the nanny character is so random and makes no sense...I expected a lot of ""obvious"" French stereotyping and the typical American obsession with over-romanticising Paris, it's certainly there. Of course some bits ring true and some are overkill. The reviewer who said Emily's outfits looked like they were taken from Carrie Bradshaw was right lol and they didn't always fit so well with the scenes. With Emily, there wasn't much character development, depth or backstory as to who she is. Even for a light show Emily is too two dimensional for the main character. Also the storylines aren't plausible or entertaining enough to run with. I get that it's meant to be light entertainment but a lot either didn't make sense or fell flat. I don't know, Younger managed to pull off a whole load of unrealistic, outlandish story lines and still make it relatable and entertaining, etc... This doesn't have the drama or relatable/fun relationships that draw you in...Maybe it gets better, but I tried 5 eps. Even with time to kill I couldn't get through the whole season. I lost interest and dare I say, found it a bit boring. I can see how some might like it, but for me I'd opt for something like Good Trouble instead."
285,Impossible to enjoy try as i try. D-uhhhhh. i cant even write this my brain has been lulled into stupid zone. Its pretty on par with sex in the city though if thats your thing. I need a jolt of electricity to wake up from this vapid dredge. Lily shouldve helmed a Friends remake!
286,"If you're white, have no interest for fair representation and actually don';t even understand the need for it, this is for you!Otherwise, just a basic rom-com set in a whitewashed Paris with the most bland cast ever. Enjoy!"
287,"Just no point in it...... feel sorry for the person who had to categorise this, there is no story so not a drama. It is listed as a comedy, there are no jokes or funny moments."
288,"Yeah its cute at some points but there is nothing exciting or thrilling or new about this. Perhaps a good time killer for some, but a time-waster for someone who expects anything more than a cliche."
289,"I agree with most of the reviews, the show is lighthearted. It's beautiful and pleasant to watch.
But it's some fairytale world where the main character solves all problems. Seems she has some magic wand and waves it from time to time. Meh..I agree that the reality sometimes is dumb but this is too much.
The show follows the same pattern that's why the plot is boring. It can't surprise you.
I would recommend it for someone who is looking for something simple and positive."
290,"This should be call Emily in NY! A french guy calls on the phone to other french guy and they talk in English!
No respect of the french culture
Too much cliché
Too much yankee"
291,"All the cliches you can think of.
Every scene lead to some place you already know. All people are beautiful, rich, glamorous and pretty unbearable, first of all Emily herself.
One doesn't need a high level clever committed intellectual show all the time, but funny and light comedies shouldn't be that idiotic."
292,"Superficial and not very funny with tired tropes. I know this is meant to be light comedy but it makes Sex and the City feel like high art, which at least had chemistry, sparkle and wit. The only reason to watch is for the Parisian scenery."
293,"I'm not sure what the target audience of this show is, but it can't be adults. Even adults who are looking for some trash tv will be disappointed.I can imagine teenage girls will enjoy this and will like the annoying main character. But the entire show is full of, dare I say it..., cliches. Yes, saying that is cliche too."
294,"Very cliché about French people (a lot) and Americans (quite a bit). Feels very outdated (rude?) to just offer silly caricatures to laugh at. Beyond a Trump's view of the world, there should be a better way to enjoy and value cultural differences."
295,"Yes it's full of American & French cliches. Yes Emily has a charmed life. But during these Covid times when I can't travel & life is dull, this is the cheerful picker upper I need. I loved being transported to gay Paris, stylish fashions, coffee & croissants and forgetting about the wind & rain outside. I was captivated and now I'm sad I've reached the end. Hoping for Series 2 🤞🏻"
296,"Very shallow and cliché.
It seems like a show for teens only.
I watched it because I miss Paris and traveling during Covid-19 :(
I needed to see Paris *sigh*"
297,"""Work makes you happy? Maybe you don't know what it is to be happy."" Classic line delivered in the opening episode. We Americans work and work and work. Are we happy? Anyway, after that it was all downhill. Too many cliches and stereotypes. My experiences in Paris, they did get the French workers animosity towards Americans working in France down pretty good. I rate it low but someone 30 years my junior, with little work experience and little travel under their belts would probably rate it 7+. I only wish the lead was about a more mature woman."
298,"Colourful clothes and picturesque scenery cannot alone produce a show. The need of an actual storyline, realistic characters and any sort of sense to begin with, are essentials to even have the right to be called a series. It is unbearably filled with platitude, it has offended clichés."
299,Its like Seinfeld and Friends....A show about nothing. And its not funny and characters are not appealing. Would recommend a skip on this one.
300,"This show is amazing, every minute of it was interesting, I am talking no boring parts at all. Even when I like a show I sometimes skip some parts because I want to get to the good parts but this show I didn't have to do it."
301,"I don't have a long, drawn out critique. The show is fun to watch. It's refreshing, not full of angst and the characters are fantastic. It's managed some depth without over-doing it."
302,"And I did. I am not saying it was the best thing ever but it is just about nice people living their lives. What an amazing change of pace. I was surprised it was on Netflix at all until I saw it was originally made for the Paramount Network. No wokeness here. There might be gay or African American people but they are just people, they don't harp on it all day. Emily is a young rising star at a Chicago marketing firm. Who, when her older boss unexpectedly finds out she is pregnant, gets the opportunity to go to Paris for a year to represent her company. Emily is pretty, kind, and maybe a bit of an ugly American but she learns a lot and is willing to admit when she messed up. The best part of the show is her french coworkers, in particular the older french boss who doesn't want to like her.. but does, and over the course of the season various romances, after all look at Emily, she is pretty. The only draw back for me is Lilly Collins I don't find to be all that charismatic and I think the show could have been even better with someone else in the role but.... still overall a good production."
303,"Actually, I watch the series out of my personal curiosity and interest to Paris so I expect I can learn from the TV series about how real Paris looks like.After 3.5 episodes watching, it just turned out I have a wrong expectation. There are so many stereotypes in the story not only about Parisian but also about Chinese ( the daughter of Zipper king in China ... it's a horrible impression about people who live in foreign countries are all Chinese rich kids ).Anyway, here is a fun story. When I was watching the series while chatting with my friend online who is studying in Paris right now. I shared about the dialogue in the drama such as 'Chinese are mean behind you, but French are mean in front of you'( an ambiguous brief, may not exact ), my friend just replied instantly 'that's unreal'. I am totally agree with her.To be honest, if you want to pass time with something easy to go through while doing housework, Emily in Paris may be a good choice, only if you can bear the annoying and unreal plots. But do not expect you can get more. From my personal perspective, I couldn't even stand the clothes of the heroine ( Sorry, Lily Collins ). And is that another kind of stereotype about American girl?"
304,I just can't stomach with Lily Collins' acting. she needs more acting lessons. bad script and storyline. but thank you for the cinematography. Paris views and landscapes are perfection.
305,"I thought it was going to be fun, sophisticated and smart but my goodness what a letdown. They portrayed the Americans as idiots, the french as rude cheating horrible people and the lead and as a weak boring young woman.
It could have been great."
306,"It's really unfortunate because being French it's very difficult to watch. There are too many clichés about the French. We are mean, rude, not respectful, lazy, almost alcoholics and heavy smokers, infidels ... And the fact that the main character doesn't speak French even a sentence at the end of the season, for a person who works in France it's a little weird. And it's like any movie or series, from the moment there are stereotypes about a country or a population, it becomes impossible to watch for the people who are represented. I understand that for people from other countries there is this vision of Paris and its people because old Hollywood films actually have this projection. But for us it's annoying. It's like the European films that make Americans look like people who think only of violence with an oyster intelligence or who want to take power over everyone and think only of money and take all the people coming from abroad for people inferior to them. Americans don't like these stereotypes and they are right. And these are the reasons why these stereotypes are hardly voiced in films and series. And so much the better, but watching this series one has the impression of seeing the movies or series of the 80s and 90s with old outdated clichés. It's borderline xenophobic, we will no longer accept this kind of old-fashioned cliché on a specific population or on people of color. It's over the 90s. So I want to hear the explanation of the producers and director who talk about the romantic vision they want to show, but it's not romantic as soon as you use stereotypes to talk about a population or a country."
307,"I don't see why they could not pick a real American girl for the job. British Lily Collins is not American enough in her attitude, and the show is a bit pointless because of that since the plot is about an American girl bringing an American perspective on French workers. Yet this is watchable, even midly entertaining. I am French and the French clichés are rather acceptable. I have known real life people similar to each French character in the show so this is plausible. Less plausible is the depiction of perfume or fashion industry, let alone marketing operations. So this looks a bit like an old French TV series, romantic, with no real action other than that. I must say the entire thing looks very amateurish, actors hesitate a lot, cinematography is mediocre, same with music. So if you are bored and have nothing better to do, you can watch this, it will be ok but do not expect anything remarkable."
308,"I don't remember when I saw the last time a show so full of cliches and stereotypes. As if all french people are nice and always dressed well. Yeah and Paris basically consites entirely of small alleys sourounded by old buildings with galleries and boutiques, whereas the country side only consists of small to large chateaus. Not to forgot that all french men are extremely handsome and love to hit on American women only. Also French people do nothing else than going for art shows, exhibition just to meet their likewise friends who are all some sort of artists."
309,"The show starts off well, and it does continue to have a few moments of humor. But, once Emily starts hopping in bed with every other guy she meets, she (and hence, the show) becomes a bit pathetic. Early on, when she is somewhat prudish (at least in comparison to the locals), the show works best. Her Chinese friend (an obvious play for the market in China) is moderately OK for a while, but as soon as she gets around to her migraine-inducing singing, she wears out her welcome. And Emily's work scenes eventually become predictable (cue a nasty comment from Emily's boss; see Emily save the day with yet another lame social media campaign). It's really unfortunate that the writers felt they had to jump the shark so early on. IMHO, the show suffers greatly as a result."
310,"""Alright this series is actually fun and very enjoyable, there's a lot fun fact of france people that I guaranteed you will not expected and didn't know, Lily Collins is amazing, Philippine Leroy Beaulieu is amazing too, her character is very unique, the supporting actor and actress is very well too, there's a lot of weird things here but what I mean weird is not weird in the bad way like bad acting and non sense things, you will know if you watch it, and of course there's a lot unexpected scene especially the ending in the last episode, they ended just like that, and seriously there's a lot of adults sexual jokes here that you will not expecting too, overall it's fun, entertaining, and enjoyable series for refreshing"""
311,"Yes, it has a stereotypical view of Paris/Parisians, but it's not trying to be a documentary for crying out loud. The show is funny and entertaining and Lily Collins does a great job as the lead. For those complaining that Emily is arrogant for not speaking French, the whole point of the show is that she's a fish out of water who's been sent to Paris at the last minute without time for preparation. They do show her trying to learn the language while she's there, so what more do you want? This is an American tv show and was originally intended to air on American cable television (not Netflix), so it's obviously always going to have the characters speaking in English. Big deal. My only complaint about the show was that the Sylvie character was outright nasty. There's a difference between being a tough boss ala the Devil Wears Prada and just bullying your employees. Sure, Emily is sometimes deserving of criticism, but I'm pretty sure that even in France Sylvie's behavior would be considered inappropriate workplace conduct. At the very least, it made Sylvie completely unlikeable to me."
312,"Now this is a bit cute, it showcases Paris the city very well but the vomit inducing Emily is the constant hero of the day. It doesn't really represent real Parisians. The office junior manages to save the day every episode, has the best ideas and makes me want to slap the snot out of her everytime.
The best/worst was seeing Emily and Mrs Robertson getting over excited at the sight of a burger! Guys, you're in Paris! An actual foodie country that has real, quality food.I love Paris, so I enjoy seeing Paris, but this is beyond saccharine sweet, lacking in originality, full of caricatures and cliches. The storylines are always blatantly obvious, you as the viewer can always tell where there going. It's telly for non thinking days. But it's sometimes uplifting, it's cute, it's full of potential but the writing and the acting leaves something (A lot) to be desired.All I think is, had this been written by British scriptwriters it would be a million times better. I've heard it compared to Sex in the City, it's not, it's more like Glee, saccharine sweet but ok. No more than ok."
313,"It's fun and entertaining and I watched it with all the intentions that it will be bad, which it was. Don't watch this if your are expecting enlightenment, character development, and a complex story line. It's just for fun, her outfits, the hot guys, and the shallow story, oh and the beauty of Paris."
314,"The series is short and cute but everyone and everything in the series is so cliched. The series a bad mixed copy of Ugly betty, Devil wears Prada and Sex and the City. I watched the series only because I love the city Paris and French people."
315,I feel like emily is more antagonist than protagonist
316,"It is not supposed to be an intellectual show, sociologically perfect. It criticizes many cultures at the same time, just to say....it is a comedy, not trying to make any points. Good fun, fantastic images of the wonderful Ligh City and the acting is (most of times) on the spot!"
317,"I see people ranting about what is Paris all about and how otherwise it's showcased here.
How does it make sense? It's a work of fiction. So as long as you enjoy fiction, it doesn't matter.I loved the entertainment. Abso!!"
318,I was Watching tv with sister and we decided to watch this. As a 35 year old male I find it hilarious and kept me interested.
319,"Despite having many flaws including unsupported subjective viewpoint of Paris, this is a fun and enjoyable series to watch. Gorgeous outfits, charming characters and quite interesting plot, I had to binge watch it in 2 days. Hopefully season 2 comes soon."
320,"Watched Emily in Paris and loved every episode.
The character Emily (Lily Collins) is a breath of fresh air and the character Gabriel (Lucas Bravo) adds a love interest that needs to continue to warm our hearts.
The City of Paris is an awesome location and the other cast members were great too. Please continue with more seasons of this delightful new show on Netflix. Emily in Paris is just what we need for fun believable beautiful entrainment."
321,"It's no pulitzer prize winning series, so everybody calm down..
It's colorful. It's funny. It's lovely.
Yes, the clothes are Carrie-Bradshaw-esk and often not in a good way. But I gave it a chance after the eye rolling first episode... And what can I say? I like the characters. I wouldn't say that I fell in love with them but they are likeable and fun.
If... IF there will be a season 2 maybe the characters are given the chance to grow.In short : a good way to escape the cruel and grey reality!"
322,"This show kept me interested. It is light and easy to watch and was good company for a couple of evenings.Emily, the lead, seem to be unstoppable. You rarely see her think about what she's doing or consequences for her actions, she just acts. Which in one way is quite annoying and unbelievable, but in another way, not. She's just acting like she would have done if she was a man. Which is quite refreshing.Anyway, give it a go. It's stupid, but that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable..!"
323,"Sorry, it's a bore. I don't know if it's just the state of the world right now, but this almost makes me nauseous. The main character isn't just inexperienced in European travel, she seems to lack the most basic workplace interaction skills.To add insult to injury, the formula for each episode is 100% predictable. Emily messes up, everyone hates her, Emily apologizes and sets about to fix it, she gains a centimeter in being accepted by her work peers. Zzzzzzz. It's like MacGyver but if MacGyver was a vapid, young insta-marketer.I can tell that the actress herself is significantly smarter than the role was written, so that makes her acting come off as -- ugh. I don't even have a word for it. With just a little more effort they could have written something meaningful, instead of a desperate attempt to make Sex In The City in Paris.She has no family that stays in touch with her? No American friends who stay in touch with her? No parents? In the days when technology makes it almost impossible to escape your friends and family? Not believable.
It's just an empty shell."
324,"As a fan of Younger, I had high hopes for this. Unfortunately as adorable as Lily Collins is, everything else about the show is very u uncomfortable and cringe worthy. Darren, dump this and try harder to keep Younger on the air ;)"
325,"There are a lots of things that i enjoyed this show.
Beautiful Paris, clothes, Lily's face and Good looking guys.
But some how it's very uncomfortable to watch this show becuase of Emily's arrogant attitude.Many reviews said that Parisian is not mean like this show, but I don't even think they(Parisian in the show) are mean. I mean, who likes that arrogant person like Emily?Emily keep saying, ""we're team, should work together"", but she never respect their French co-worker as a team. she just acting like ""I'm your boss from now on. Everything that you did so far was wrong and I'm right.""
And later whining "" They hate me. what's wrong with them?""She thinks herself with full of passion and have positive attitude but she's just rude and arrogant.But somehow in that show even she is so bad, Parisian getting like her. How nice they are!I wish Emily doesn't represent all American. I'd like to believe that it's just show, so her attitude is just for fun to make dramatic. I sincerely hope."
326,"Underneath its fancy fashion and picturesque landscape, Emily in Paris is a deeply problematic show which discriminates against and belittles other non-American white cultures. Instead of making the effort to assimilate into her new environment like anyone who's recently relocated to a new country would do, the protagonist Emily thinks the more logical thing to do would be to obnoxiously force all her American practices and values onto other characters, with little to no respect local customs and culture.A lot of the plot also does not make sense and makes it obvious that the screenwriters hasn't worked a day in anything related to ad agencies, brand management, digital marketing or social media management. Asking for a completely accurate reflection of the real world is impossible, but the show does not even try to attempt to make its storylines believable with regards to how these industries function.Lastly, it's baffling and insulting that the producers decided to cast someone who doesn't speak Mandarin to play a character from Shanghai who somehow speaks better French and English than her native tongue. For a show that debuted on a global streaming platform, it didn't seem to really care about its international audiences. If the producers can find capable French actors for the French roles, they should be able do the same for the Chinese roles."
327,It's so predictable! There are a handful of funny moments but they probably make up about 3 minutes of total time (across the entire series). At least it was short
328,"This show is lighthearted, genuine and bubbly. I love the characters they fit perfectly. The french vibes make me want to move to Paris RIGHT NOW! The storyline is not cringe at all and the acting is great. Pretty impressed and highly recommend"
329,"The worst show I've ever seen. So pathetic, cliche, boring, full of stereotypes, offensive and bad"
330,"I really loved this show. Yes it's a little cliche and a Hollywood version of Paris, but is there really anything wrong with that? I thought it was such a fun show to watch! There's adventure, romance, and humor, what more could I ask for. I've watched this show twice and I enjoyed it both times. Would highly recommend this show if you're looking for a break from anything serious or just life in general. Super lighthearted and would 100% watch a again!"
331,"Light hearted, funny and cute show. Mixed with Parisian complications. I love and can't wait till the next season. Please do more episodes in a season. Killing me with the cliff hanger!"
332,"I never write reviews, but I had to after seeing all the negative criticism towards these series. Emily in Paris is meant to entertain a young audience. It's not meant to be some culturally accurate documental. It's fun, it's fashionable, it's the European dream seen through an American girl's eyes. I had fun watching it, and I think that was the goal of the series. I enjoyed it very much, I hope it gets renewed for a second season."
333,"This show has become my ""safe place"" - it is cute, it is funny and an all-around magical fantasy that takes you away from the mundane weekdays. It is rare that a show captivates me to this degree!"
334,"We do have strict buckle-up rules when in a car and passengers certainly can't sit on another persons lap in the front of a car, especially an open top model. The police would be all over you in no time.
Also in watching nine episodes Emily has worn about thirty outfits. Must have a very large income and an even larger closet in her small apartment.
Derek D. France"
335,"Just watched the whole 10 episodes today and what I can say is that it is a tital cliché and the only reason I give it 5 points is that it is well filmed and the views from Paris made my day.
Actually Emily is the collective image of the American vs. Europeans. She is inadequate, not well educated and unprofessional in many cases which in real life would lead to her fire way before it happened in this totally unrealistic plot. The way ahe drunk the whole glass of wine during the degustation explains is all :) But.. Beautiful actors, scenes and food images."
336,"Hello, I merely made it through the first 2 episodes. How many cliches can you pull in one series??? Mainly the French (and I am European, not French) are pictures as one-dimensional being.. Watch Sylvie walk with her hand always up in the air, all the innuendos about the french having a mistress as a way of life.. just made me gag.. Then there is the problem of Emily: she is a totally and completely UNLIKABLE character. She is behaving arrogant and typically american.. and you just know where this is going. she was immediately disliked but of course will score some very good points along the way, which makes the american approach triumph.. The only reason I kept watching this is: . well Paris has never looked better or lovelier.. just turn of the sound and watch the beautiful scenery.. it is the only reason to really watch this ."
337,"So inlove with this serie!!! Lily Collins is the best! I watched it over and over again because of the great actors, fashion, humor and of course Paris! Can't wait for season 2!!!!"
338,"A pleasure to watch this! Positive, optimistic and humorous appearance. Beautiful, nice and sweet and strong girl. Beautiful surroundings and wonderfully romantic!"
339,"When I started watching it I thought it was a cliches cringe fest; however I quickly got into it. The episodes are a nice length to keep watching and it's fresh, fun and doesn't take itself to seriously. Reminds me of things like gossip girl."
340,"I absolutely loved Emily in Paris! I loved the memories it brought into my mind, and I like the cultural 'war' ongoing through out the plot... :)
After watching a few of the episodes one after the other, I was surprised to discover that I love the characters! Even Sylvie!
So I am really looking forward to season 2! :)"
341,"Clichés? Lots of them!!! Who cares? I certainly didn't! ""Not all Americans are like the protagonist"": yes, thank you, we know. ""Not all French are like the ones portrayed in the series"": yes, thank you, we knew that too! If I wanted to watch something that showed real Americans in real Paris, I would have watched a documentary and get bored to death. The show was funny. Actually it was more than that, it was intelligently funny in an unapologetic way. Watch it and above anything else enjoy it (if you don't laugh when you hear ""and without pleasure, who are we? German"" or ""my father wants me to go back to China, take over his business and dress like Angela Merkel"", I don't know what can make you laugh)."
342,"We watched the first episode, but this is really not that interesting or charming. I only gave it a chance because of the 7.5 review score, so I had to come here and explain it's not worth it.I rarely give up on shows, but the acting was so stiff and fake. I was not remotely invested or interested in her character. You can't watch a show where you don't care what happens to the main character.I'm not against a lighthearted show, but this was just lame cliches about French people and no funny parts. Next!"
343,"At first this series looked like Gossip Girl, but after... omg... first of all this world need urgent corrections, Emily is what? Girl with no moral at all? Being with literally everyone who approached her.. for real? She is changing her partner everyday, sleeping with minors? And in the same time in love with like 10th of those? And this supposed to be sweet or what? This would be a great series if they put some romance in it, but this is garbage, this series has the worst message to tell to every teenage or growing up girl.. Just skip this , its not even fun, it's pathetic and terrible, if she is so cheap put some value to it please .. Only valuable thing is this series is piece of fashion she is wearing and pathetic copy of Gossip Girl, but be real Gossip Girl had much more values in it, this is pathetic nymphomaniac woman story at the end, nothing else."
344,"Amazing, plot is great, characters, no fake scenes shot all in paris"
345,"The script is lazy. Zero effort was made. It gives the character Emily more credit than she deserves. It's basically Lalaland for young teens who don't think they need to do much, besides social media and having some fun ideas, but deserve everything in life and hope everything just falls on their lap. It's 2021, I can't believe we are still producing cringingly crap shows like this. Sad.Great costumes and Paris of course.."
346,I thought this was going to be some silly comedy but it turn out to be much better than expected. Yes is funny and silly but deeply entertaining and not based on cliche jokes. It reminds of sex and the city and a touch of Frasier style.
347,"Emily is very hard to watch as a female, first of all, the character appears to be very innocent, naive, not very smart, doesn't care about anyone but herself , her self- assured confidence was rude and arrogant to take in. There are many scenes in the Emily show felt so old, that nothing was new about this tv show, even the jokes felt like so 1950s, as if are they writers born in the 50s when you guys never seen the world before ? When the Darren Star said to the media he wanted to may a show as a love letter to Paris, well, he has a strange way of expressing it. This is for sure a unrequited love, the French and Parisian have spoken, THEY HATE THIS SHOW. I am an Asian, I hate this show too. Gosh, this tv show is so childish and so old , such a mess !"
348,"It was supposed to be something like City, but it's not. It's just a shallow bad story. It's not funny or interesting at all. They tried really hard, but they did not succeed."
349,"This is what happens when Americans come across european elegance, beauty and culture. They try to fit-in, with no hope, they try to blend in with no luck and try struggle to mingle again with no hope, so what do they do? They baptise the opposite party with cliches, try to ridicule it and they put on some poor taste ""american chic"" clothes and they just make a fool of them selves.
Dont bother watching this. Really. Unless you are a us citizen."
350,"I've read the negative reviews and my view is that they are taking things way to seriously. Yes it exaggerates both American and French culture and behaviors but it's a feel good comedy! This is not a historical/cultural drama or documentary. It's a fun show, that's all. As to stereotyping, please give people a little more faith. Most people know there's a whimsical and slightly fantasy quality to the show. If you want French cultural accuracy then watch a French film!"
351,"As someone who lived and worked in Paris I can enjoy this as it's intended it's silly but beautiful. fingers crossed on season 2.
Also a lot of very bitter sad people reviewing this try letting some light into your lives it's quite nice"
352,"Although it may not show how real Parisian life, it's nice to live a life on fantasy though Emily's eyes"
353,I really enjoyed watching Emily in Paris. Can't wait for the second season!!!
354,"A light series and it is interesting to see the collision of French culture with American culture, and the dramatic side of the series is very bad, unlike the comic"
355,"The characters are weak, not very well constructed and one dimensional. The French are portrayed almost as predators, lazy and extremely unpolite. I lived in France for five years and I think series like this are a huge damage to culture, since most of the people from the US learn what they know about culture from other countries from TV and movies"
356,"I thought this was so fun. I binged in two days. Life has been so stressful lately and this took me to a place where I could live in a fantasy - even if just for 25 minutes. I am sure the stereotypes are, well, stereotypes; but the show is funny and cute and exactly what I needed."
357,"The very first episode hade me angry, it was all about US is so Good, Europe is so behind. But then the US girl shower adaption and I got invested. And now I am actually rooting for her. I am om ep 7 and she is kind of sweet. It grows om you. I hope she knows gfs are harder to come by than bfs. Ort actually that Darren Star knows!"
358,"This was a fun and romantic comedy. It was light, cool fashion and over all just fun to watch. I'm really hoping for a season 2!!"
359,"Gave an extra star for the producers. this show is exactly what we need nowadays, it's a really good distraction and feel good series to fall in love with. Lily Collins only deserves the best things in the world"
360,Beginning is nice but then it becomes boring. If you like fashion go for it.
361,It might be full of stereotypes but anybody who has been to Paris will know they're justified. It's constantly being compared to Sex and the City that might put a lot of people off but it's head and shoulders above that.
362,It's funny how they got the French right and once you learn their language they are lovely
363,Loved every minute. Sure there are cliches and stereotypes but in a good way. The characters abs romance draw you in and despite being predictable at times it is the kind of predicting that you enjoy doing. Can't wait for season two and more of Gabriel
364,"It's a good soap opera that I can watch during my lunch time. The flow is cliche but still tolerable with glory scenery.What I couldn't stand is the main character casted by Lily Collins. Fake smile, Disney style of eyebrow movement, and she still looks like she's from the snow white movie instead of Emily. I like her boss more, and agree with her - Emily is just annoying."
365,"Enjoyable to watch and well acted. It's a pleasant feel good series with loads of attractive men and women, shot across Paris' many lovely locations. The short episodes make for easy viewing and the pace and storylines make it really quite enjoyable. Certainly worth watching, just remember is 'fiction' so really not true to life in Paris, but a lot of fun none the less!"
366,"They couldn't have cast better actors for this show! Everyone was incredible! I love everything about this fun, romantic comedy! Lilly Collins is absolutely perfect!!! I can't wait for the next season!!! I give it an 11 out of 10 stars! Brilliant!"
367,"I went back and forth with this show. Maybe a bit confused at times?? BUT after binging the entire season, I loved it. It was cute and quirky and funny and lovable. There were so many times with lily collins outfits that I felt like I was watching a 90s movie😂. Hello! Passport to Paris, anyone?? Honestly, it was overall really good. By the last episode I knew I wanted more. This show has tons of potential!"
368,"Similar feeling but enjoy. Emily in the new city, met friends, cute guys, lun lah life."
369,"The Devil Wears Prada meets Gossip Girl meets SATC. This show is amazing! You have Paris, the fashion and Lily Collins witch is the perfect match. I really hope fore many more seasons to come! And it is so funny too! Watch the first season over one night, and I will watch it again soon!"
370,"I don't know how the hell I needed up turning this on, I'm a snob who turns the nose up at stuff like this. I suppose it might be that Emily is cute and caught my eye. Now let me say this show is pure cheese and lame in the traditional sense BUT the job Lily Collins does has to be praised. She plays this part great as do the others in the show. It' really over the top but there is something about the pace and the music cuts and editing that makes this whole thing work. It's a guilty pleasure but also has some credibility for how well done the whole thing is. I think I saw Darren Star on the credits and I think he has done a lot of TV for years so obviously a pro at what works. Emily is cute as it gets and I'd take her midwest charm all day over any snobby high fashion woman all day every day."
371,This is bad and boring. All Emily does is complain about the fact she can't get herself to learn any French and establish the AMERICAN way. Ugh. Really meh.
372,"It's a good show romantic , little bit of comedy. It's a light hearted show . I quite liked it"
373,"Paris and France is so much more than what they show here. They just brushed the surface, picking all the stereotypes (and even more that I didn't know about).
I'm receiving messages from friends who have never been to Paris nor France, who watched the show, and are getting the wrong idea about the culture.
Everything goes slow in Paris?! Yeah... Maybe for rich people working for a luxury brand. The Paris I experienced goes fast at all time and is exhausting. They don't backup their facts and clichés with history. Why things are made a certain way, like how the districts are arranged.Emily, though staying in a chambre de bonne, is privileged and belongs to the less of 1% of the population living in Paris. Whoever produced this TV show has not experienced Paris himself, and definitely not experienced it the same way Emily did, leaving everything behind and moving to a foreign country.Overall, it's... Nice to watch and I'm rediscovering the Paris I know. And it makes me miss the pastries so much!
If you want a good point of view on how things are, watch Paul Taylor stand up comedian."
374,"So interesting and so exciting that I just watched all 10 episodes without any pause. It made me cry and laugh at the same time, I wish it had more episodes. Can't wait to watch 2nd season!!!"
375,"Although this is not the best written show and contains many stereotypes, it is still a fun watch. Its super cool to see different locations in Paris and it's great background noise for when your doing other things!!"
376,"My dream life is to be Emily in paris ,, i like every thing in the show and watched it for like 5 times"
377,"I waited a while to watch it because I thought Lilly Collins would annoy me. Don't know why, but I was right. It was entertaining. Most of the characters were likable, but Lilly Collin's character was too self important. Instead of it coming off as confident and eager, it came off as ignorant and arrogant. I mean who goes to a foreign country for a temporary job where they don't speak the language and sends out a list of rules for conduct in the workplace when they aren't the boss? Total overstep and she acted like she didn't understand why that was inappropriate. Her desperation to be liked by everyone was annoying and frustrating. She wasn't that charming to expect to be liked by everyone. She just came off like a spoiled brat. If they had made her less whiny and more humble, it would have been great."
378,Show does a really bad job of showcasing what the French are like. It's almost as this show was done by people that have never even been to Europe. What did seem real was a uncultured white American being annoying in foreign country haha j/k anyways show is ok and something to watch. Just don't expect too much.
379,"This is a cute show with a fun story and I am enjoying watching it, but the entire thing is a cliche'. From Emily's outfits to the horny French men, this show has every French cliche' ever. The only thing missing is Pepe Le Pew....LOLI give it a 7 because it is a fun watch, but just know beforehand about the over-the-top portrayal of Paris. Other than that the scenery is beautiful in the show, the acting is brilliant, and the much anticipated love story keeps you watching."
380,"No, this is not an Art's master piece. And in mostly, is not original either. But this is exactly what I needed to relax in a weekend. The plot is pretty easy to follow and you will probably be able to do another thing while watching. The cast is also great in their roles."
381,I had a blast watching this. The trailers do not do it justice. Press play now!
382,"Great city sights! Good acting (for the characters). Really light, so you can relax.
This girl, ultra junior employee, came to fix a marketing company with her secret weapon... Instagram. Blah."
383,"Me and my wife are only on the 4th episode, and we are hooked on Emily in Paris! It is very entertaining. We know that a lot of big budget firms only want actors that can speak ""American English"". We love the fact that many of the actors in this show are French, have a French accent, and speak French in the show! This adds so much more life and believability to the show, and it makes it alot more enjoyable to watch compared to other shows. The jokes are funny, the characters are well rounded and interesting, and the actors are great! The only downside I think is the show lacks a bit in the composition of the shots, they seem a bit flat sometimes."
384,"This TV show is created by Darren Star who has also created Sex and the City and Younger which are two great TV shows that I love so of course I had to watch Emily in Paris. I think the concept the TV show is a really great idea but the overall execution could have been better. I didn't find Emily herself overly likeable which is never a great start! She went to a different country and didn't think once to research about the culture, people or language which seems strange especially since she had planned on living there for an entire year!The clothes on this show are stunning! Each character has a look and truly incredible sense of style. The only issue on the styling of this TV show is the amount of designer clothes that Emily got to wear, though she rocked each outfit its really hard to believe the she could afford that much Chanel!One of my favourite characters was Mindy, Emily's best friend played by Ashley Park... who may I add she meets on her very first day. Like what are the odds that one of the very first people Emily meets speaks English and they click immediately! Mindy has seriously the craziest backstory! Her dad is the 'zipper king' of China and wants her to take over the business however she's got a different idea. She decides to convince him to let her go to Paris for business school, she drops out and becomes a nanny... I need a spinoff ASAP!Overall I consider Emily in Paris a guilty pleasure and easy watch. I definitely won't be rushing to re-watch it any time soon and I personally don't think it needs another season. But if you like cheesy drama, inspiring fashion and good looking men then you should definitely give this Netflix TV show a watch."
385,"The plot has potential, but... The script was incredibly weak, cliché lines, predictable dialogue, the acting was mediocre at best, difficult to tell if this was as a result of week actors ( I am not familiar with any of them) or poor direction combined with the terrible script. It was so annoying that it would not even serve as light entertainment, far too annoying. Made it through four episodes and called it quits so one star per episode I managed to watch, and that's being generous."
386,"Fake girl in a fake Paris... surrounded by fake people and posting on Instagram her fake life every 30 seconds...
So sad... it's a drama, not a comedy...."
387,"For context:
I'm French and was born in Paris
I live in Chicago
I work at an ad agency
So there is a lot about that show that is upsetting. It really feels like a CW TV show... and not a good one.Nothing makes sense in that show... yeah let's send a girl to a foreign country where she doesn't speak the language... have her work in a company for which she has no relevant experienceI guess all French people are rude, Chain smoke and can't resist trying to bone any American girl in sight...Everything in that show is so cringe worthy"
388,"I love Paris and therefore enjoyed this cute, witty and enjoyable rom-com. Lily Collins is a fresh new actress and the writing enhances her American culture (even though she's British). The scenery is divine as are the fashion choices. It's light-hearted and I enjoy all the characters. I look forward to season 2."
389,This is the sort of show you watch for a laugh and stop watching and don't care. Lead actor is pretty but very Disney. A show for the bored!
390,"The premise of Emily in Paris is so strong its a wonder why others have not used it before. The clash of cultures between the PC, social media literate Emily and the old world, un-PC, refined, sophisticated France is comedy gold. Filming Paris at its absolute prettiest helps too. The first few episodes are an absolute hoot as Emily gets to grip with the culture shock and her Parisienne colleagues adapt to her. Around half-way through some of the plotting becomes over contrived and the novelty of Emily having some brilliant social media response to every problem becomes a yawn. The chemistry between Mindy and Emily is not convincing, while Gabriel is frankly a bit dull. By contrast, the three key figures from Savoir the marketing agency are all solid characters. Overall, a fun series, but I would hope for new characters if they do a second series."
391,"Imagine a fake plastic version of Paris, take a smug, shallow American, along with a script so basic it would fail a school English assignment, absolutely none of the fun or charm of Sex and the City and you have Emily in Paris. Dreadful. Completely dreadful."
392,"How did this even get made? It's recycled, rehashed, cliched trash. I guess we have one thing to be thankful to Covid for, a drop in this type of brain melting garbage in the future.."
393,"How could anyone find Emily to be an attractive human being. She is self-centred and so ridiculously stupid I find myself on the verge of being sick just listening to her talk. She began flirting with the bombshell neighbour while still in a relationship with her committed Chicago boyfriend, and then continued to flirt with said neighbour after she found out he was not single. Sounds like a scumbag thing to me. Gabriel is a much worse human being. He actively pursued someone while in a relationship and gave his significant other a false-ultimatum to decide their relationship making Camille seem like a horrible miserable person who destroyed their relationship. He should have been honest with himself and her and ended the relationship instead of forcing her to do it.EMILY IN PARIS IS AN AWFUL SHOW ONLY BECAUS OF THE PERSONAL LIFE OF EMILY. The workplace drama is very interesting and worth it to watch, however the rest of it is absolutely vile. All episodes should eb stripped and purged from Netflix and destroyed."
394,"Boring Midwest character who is desperate to get the attention... I hope she fails, ends up like ton of international students who have been exploited."
395,"I think this show was so lovely, I binged watched it in less than 24h! My only complaint would be that in the show, they always ditch the American ways of Emily, while in real life, France is quite ""Americanized"". So when a character says ""The French are like this"" or ""The people in Paris are like that"", I cannot totally agree, but besides that, it was an amazing show to watch. The story is fun and gives us hope, the costumes and decor is obviously amazing, and Lily Collins is amazing as per usual. I definitely recommend if you want something light (and it helps with the travel craving we're all having in 2020!)."
396,Why do you waste time writing review with a score a 1 star. Please go elsewhere I don't know you're probably moron or philosophy major who would you will never amount to anything in life so please let us read comments by people who loves television and movies. You don't have enough perspective and intelligence to be heard.just a reminder for all of you morons out there!!10 stars is for rare masterpiece like The Shawshank Redemption or the Godfather or any movie in this category.1 star is for something so horrible that you can't even understand why people manage to spend 10 dollars on this piece of trash. Even Sharknado doesn't deserve a rating of 1 star so imagine a show like Emily in Paris.So please go elsewhere... anywhere but here. We don't want you to pollute our precious review section with your garbage. Thank you for your consideration but get the %?$$/?? out
397,"This is a light, easily binge watched series from Netflix in a 30 minute episode format. It's the story of Emily Cooper, a 20 something ad agent from Chicago sent to work in an agency her company acquired in Paris. ""Emily in Paris"" is a COMEDY, don't generalize that every French character portrayed is stereotypical of every person in France. It's not real, it's television.Just watched ""Ted Lasso"" (Apple TV) about an American coach hired to manage (coach) a Premier League team in London, it was funny and well written. It jokes about Americans and Brits and no one got offended, it's a comedy. Every American or British character portrayed in that series is not every American or every Briton, viewers didn't generalize and get offended.The acting and writing was good. The locations were beautiful, Paris and the Loire Valley. I look forward to season 2."
398,"This is my first review ever, but I think Emily in Paris deserves that I write something in its defense after so many negative reviews.
So, please, if you are thinking about watching this but you are not sure because of critics, hear me out.First of all, I am European myself and I had no intention of watching this, but eventually I did just to see what all the fuss is about, especially because I saw that there are only 10 episodes 30 minutes long, so I was thinking 'well, I can binge this and come to the judgment myself'.
Thank God for that, beacuse I was pretty impressed with this show.
Is it the best series ever? No. Is it a little bit cringey? Yes.
BUT I think that people today are easily offended by anything. Yes, maybe there is a lot of clichés presented, but I liked the series because of that even more because it showed me how wrong most people can be about different cultures and how many stereotypes exist around the world.
While I was watching it, I wasn't thinking 'oooh, Parisians must behave that way irl or 'Americans are so ignorant'. Actually, I was thinking quite the opposite. I found it funny that someone may even believe that.
The show is enjoyable and the plot is very easy to follow. I do not recommend this for people who overanalyze everything or who take everything too seriously. This show is perfect for those who are looking for fun weekend getaway or something to entertain themselves before going to bed.
I give it 8/10 and am looking forward to season 2."
399,"As usual all the bad reviews come from the French people. Be glad your country and people are portrayed as beautiful/romantic. I've lived in Paris for 4 years and Paris is dirty, gloomy and unsafe. Men are terrible to women, people are awful, so it's nice to see something nice about paris( at least what we dream about.
This is tv, is meant to be entertainment. Is supper light and funny, yes cliches but who cares, IT'S TV. My husband is French and he loved it, he could not stop laughing. The acting is fine, lily Collins is lily Collins. She's georgeous to look at, yes the outfits were a bit weird but who cares. It was so light and new, I was glad to have something new on Netflix.Watch it people, ignore the French reviews, nothing is ever realistic, and the French ALWAYS complain and are never happy about anything.Love this show. Give it a try."
400,"The show could have been cute. but it's wildly unoriginal and hopelessly dated. it doubles down on every worn-out trope and cliche about the french (and to a lesser extent, americans). feels like a throwback to the vanilla monoculture days before internet came around. complete lack of imagination, introspection, or nuance."
401,I already left my review I just wanted to say that I don't understand how this has a 7.5 on here. That makes absolutely no sense to me. So bad.
402,"I tried this show since I was a fan of Sex in the City. Say what you will about Sarah Jessica Parker, she definitely had a kind of charisma and realness that the lead in this show sorely lacks. Sure, she is pretty, but that is about all she has going for her! Granted, she does not have a great script or storyline to work with. This is an extremely superficial show that leaves you feeling cold about all of the characters. While Carrie Bradshaw also had messed up priorities and made stupid decisions, the audience was rooting for her and could see themselves in her flaws, which made Sex in the City interesting. In Emily in Paris you kind of just want her to fail because she is so dang annoying. It's too bad because a story about a Paris adventure could have been really fun and interesting."
403,"Sorry, I rated this low for several reasons. The main one is Lily Collins. She looks childlike, so I could not get to grips with the whole romance thing. She would be far better off playing school girls where her looks would be appropriate and her acting skills fit better.
Secondly, her acting skills. Close to zero. She appears to have no sense of 'self' and tries to repeat facial expressions and cues that are I think intended to be cute, but again, just serve to make her look like a little girl.
I watched the first 2 and half of the 3rd episode and that was my lot."
404,Loved every minute of it! Can't wait for the second season!
405,"Unlike most recent Netflix offerings Emily in Paris doesn't try to shove any kind of social or political agenda down your throat.
It's simply a fun little romantic comedy with a great lead and interesting supporting characters."
406,"This show is badly acted, cliche and irritating. The french in the show are all rude to emily from the start for no reason which is unrealistic and unfair to the french.So many things in the show are total lies. French people do have to go to work on time and have normal working days like anyone else. Not every french man is ridiculously flirtatious and many other things are just odd lies.Gaining a following of thousands from posting selfies is unrealistic. Emily is the only one who comes up with any good marketing ideas but is constantly belittled by her boss.Emily is also annoying and not very likeable as she sleeps with her best friends brother and boyfriend.Her friend who is too shy to sing gets up and belts out a full volume song for the whole park then acts too shy at the club before again going on to enthusiastically perform seconds later.Overall not a good show in any aspect other than perhaps it drew me in enough to finish the 1st season."
407,It is so nicely made..they way how a person who's new in a country without knowing their regional language is so well portrayed..plus always there is positive vibe..and so much to learn..how marketing works etc etc..and story arc of all leads characters are also shown well.!
408,There are a lot of old « clichés ». The writing is not exceptionnal. The most desapointing aspect is the photography. Paris should have been a caracter. It is the most beautiful city in the world. Look at « call my agent » and « Émilie Poulin ». There could have been more poetry into it. Desapointed.
409,The best new tv show which makes you feel relax and fun.
410,"The story starts of quite well but all you see afterwards is a principled working bee turning into an insta-fashion-dweep.
Emily looses character, the men are all the same and have no character/depth at all and the jokes and stereotypes become even more obvious then it already started with.Althoug they try to depict France/Paris(ians) in a stereotypical sense, the 'American point of view' is sky high: mad men but from the perspective of a confused woman.In the words of Pierre Caudalt: ringarde! Ringarde! Ringarde!"
411,"I'm learning French so wanted to watch something that is French related. But the show was full of annoying and cringey tropes that should be outdated by now. The main actress is ignorant and arrogant and can get away with anything because she's pretty. Sure she has good work ethics but she always tries to force her American ways on other people with different cultures. She might change later on the show but I'm just not interested enough to want to see that.
Another outdated trope is the supporting minority actors/actresses such as the black coworker and the Asian friend that Emily randomly meets in a park. The most annoying moment to me is when the Asian friend and Emily are in the restaurant. Emily has to complain about the undercooked steak when the handsome chef comes out to address that complaint. While the Asian girl is eye-goggling the chef, his attention is fixed on Emily because she's prettier which I find very depressing and cringey. This kind of scenes have been played so many times in shows/movies before.
But I stopped watching the show only when Emily's boyfriend doesn't want to fly to Paris to visit her because he doesn't know what to do during the day by himself when he gets there. This kind of behavior is self-pity, immature and insecure at its best. I've been in long term relationships so I just can't stand watching this. I know it serves a purpose in the show but personally, it's lazy and cliché.
Overall, I don't like this show and wouldn't want to spend my time watching it even just as a background noise."
412,"Though I was not sure who I could reach or want to reach. But this serie was great for me. I love it and brought me back to my time while traveling for work. Absolutely, there are things overreacted and over done but there are many things that also relate to people's lifes and adventures. Last year because of work I was able to travel to Barcelona, Luxembourg, Istanbul, Tel aviv, Brno & Geneva. A whole new discovery of tmyself has been developed because of this. And now... it is over. No more traveling no more discovery, the only thing new I can find are the dusty corners of my own room. This serie brought me back to my memories, work, romances and my wildly/ chaotic life which I am so thankfull of. !THANK YOU!"
413,I'm not sure why so many people don't like this show. Its
414,Story was amazing. Ending was too serious. Aur kya bulo yr.. it
415,"Emily in paris is so well combined with today's social media culture, modern point of view and the good old Paris that It feels so familiar and feel like the actors and actresses are my friend. Loved it and seeking for the season 2!!:)"
416,"Don't know why there's hate around this it's just light hearted fun. It's shot beautifully and having lived in France for 7 years I can say it's kind of accurate and it's funny too. Give it a chance, I can't wait for season 2"
417,"First time i write a review but got the urge to write one for Emily in paris! Absolutely loved it! Its young, makes you day dream and i was transported into the show!"
418,"Sex and the City meets the Devil Wears Prada meets Paris Je t'aime,Every cliché successfully blends what is utterly annoying about the French and what's irresistibly charming. The subtle culture clashes, like ""we work to live and you live to work"" are spot on.Looking forward to Season Deux!"
419,"I watched the whole first season in one afternoon. Its very fun and feeling good show, I loved it!"
420,"I love this show! The fashion, scenery, the plot, humour and of course lily Collins :D"
421,"Here me out... It's much more G rated than the mentioned predecessor however it has that light hearted good feel with a gracious amount of drama and laughs. First two episodes were a little on the ""cringe"" side, but it's worked its way into my favourites. Started watching tonight and am on episode 7. Easily binged. Recommend giving it a shot."
422,"There were a lot of things that made me cringe, her ""machine"", her jumping in and out of bed, but I loved the clothes the clothes, and I loved the relationships, and her naïveté, something my dotter faced when she lived in Europe one year! Haha she found out real fast that Americans weren't all that in all parts of the world. It was humbling but in a good way. I don't care what anyone says, to me Lily Collins could be the next Audrey Hepburn! She's beautiful, she's cute, I think she's got it! Also, I'm so glad they showed so much of Paris, even the little streets, cafes, markets! I binged it in one night, smiling all the time."
423,"Emily In Paris
First i heard about the series and i was very excited to watch it
Of course i set reminder on from Netflix
Just first i didn't see the trailer
I saw the series directly
I was a very nice intro
Also nice ending of season
Anyone who think not to watch the series
He is really a bad decision
It is a snacky series
Comdy
Funny
Love
All of this is just in a averge 28 minutes
Amazing story
I recommend this series
You will not get bored i guarantee you that."
424,"If you like or love gossip girl you would love this show!!!!!
It's not the same as gossip girl but it's kinda the same.
Too sad there's only one season so can't wait for the rest!!!"
425,It's for entertainment. Paris is gorgeous. Very predictable and every cliche you could imagine is shown. It's entertaining at this point what else are you gonna watch?
426,"Really wonderful show, I loved the Paris locations and the characters are good. Nice really weekend show to binge on a rainy day."
427,"Very cute and easy to watch. I really enjoyed this after initially seeing it on Netflix and reading a few nasty reviews and thinking I wouldn't make it through an episode. It may be cliche but casting is great, the fashion is absolutely wonderful and then there is Paris captured as I remember it."
428,I dont usually write reviews but I loved this show so much and hopefully there will be another season!
429,"Its a show that is meant to entertain. There is nothing really authentic or serious to it. Its a fairy tale with some speedbumps and stereotypes.That being said if you look for something that is easy and fun to watch in these dark times. Its a great little escape, well produced and easy on the eyes.Watch it and don't analyze it."
430,"As the show tells ''Emily in Paris "", she goes to France without learning French and has difficulty adjusting. It shows her exciting journey and adventures and the beautiful experience. I watched the whole season yesterday and I loved it. And this series wasn't totally frictional. People from different countries have different perspective in life and different cultures and way of looking at things so I think it's quite realistic.It's worth watching!"
431,"Drama, beautiful people, laughs, impeccable styling, and an idyllic lifestyle in an amazing city? Fans of shows like Gossip Girl, The Bold Type, Elite, Younger, and Pretty Little Liars will enjoy this one. Definitely more lighthearted than the aforementioned, this show will leave you wanting more. I was honestly surprised to see that each episode last 30 minutes a piece with only 10 episodes for the season. Definitely, not enough! It's funny, silly, sexy, awkward in the best way, realistic but also unrealistic at the same time. I took a year of French in high school and this 10 episode show has quite possibly taught me more than I learned that entire year. While your love for Emily grows, you get to know the people she meets as she gets to know them and it just leaves you wanting and waiting for more. There has to be more than one season to this show, I need more. Impatiently, patiently waiting for more!"
432,"Although beautiful, somewhat fun, and light hearted, the series is outdated in presentation of women, relationships, and cross-cultural matters. Emily is dressed like a 'tart' most of the times as well as her Chinese friend - is this a nod towards the male view on women's sexuality? Emily is supposed to be a bright twenty something professional from a Chicago marketing firm, yet dresses and behaves like a teen-age girl from a preppy school with references in clothes, behaviour and attitude to Clueless (1995) which is all-right on its own but sends mixed messages to the audience. Most of the presented in the movie cultural dilemmas are spot on - I lived in French speaking environments and can say that it is no piece of cake to communicate with the French at first. But generally speaking, they are very friendly people. What annoys most in the movie is the lack of any warm feelings or true relationships and characters behind the beautiful facade of the city and clothes. Sex related topics and scenes seem to be similar to Sex and The City and way outdated and boring. Sex is not love and Paris is the city of love not sex as many Americans think or led to think. Sex is just an element in love and not its focus. The French love relationships, emotions, feelings, and tenderness not some sex positions and talking about sex. The French do not talk about sex they talk about love - very different subjects. They say make love to have sex. For them, you have to feel something towards the person in order to make love together, not simply have one-night stands. Although this can happen but not in 'American' way. Overall it is a disappointing series although can be watched when there is nothing else to do or see."
433,"I was Emily. I came to Paris just for a few days but it decided to keep me for a a good few weeks longer. I've tasted everything that this city can offer - love, views, splendid parties, dinners in cafes lasting hours, intrugues among groups of friends (kisses on the cheeks while you actually don't like someone or slept with her/his bf/gf), dog's (well I hope) merde on walkways, lady in boulangerie yelling at me cause I asked for baguette in english... This series just brings back all these fabulous memories and it pretty much shows how outsiders experience Paris! And shots of the city are great!"
434,"This was hurtful to watch, way to repetitive sentences and topics, the plot made very little sense and it was way to unrealistic. Selling Paris as a amusement park, with all the stereotypical topics of French people and other European countrys that Americans might love but they're way to repetitive and unfunny."
435,"In 2020, most of us have not had the opportunity to travel and see the world because of the Covid-19 pandemic. We had to find new ways to escape the monotony of our daily lives that were now spent almost exclusively at home. In that context, shows like Netflix's Emily in Paris might just provide the right amount of escapism that you have been craving.This entire project rests on the shoulders of Lily Collins' title character, and the main question going in was whether or not she would be able to single-handedly carry this whole property on her own. Thanks to her effortless likability, her funny quirks and the sense of relatability that she brings to the role, the answer was a yes for me. She was supported by a great performance from the show's revelation in the hot-guy-next-door role, Lucas Bravo (Gabriel), along with very good turns from Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu (Sylvie), Ashley Park (Mindy), Samuel Arnold (Julien) and Bruno Gouery (Luc). The cast is what holds this thing together, for sure.Behind the camera is where the problems start to surface. Don't get me wrong : the show is competently made, and it captures the pulse of Paris in a very entertaining - albeit not incredibly original or artistic - way. However, the script makes use of story beats and genre tropes that have been seen on so many occasions in romantic comedies that it often becomes predictable. This lack of originality does not take away from the entertainment value of the show, but the same can not be said about artistic value.Now, on the controversial side of things : I have read quite a few reviews from French people that found the show overly caricatural, clichéd and, sometimes, downright offensive. While it is true that Paris is depicted in a silly and stereotypical way, it's important to keep in mind that the show is told from an American's point of view who has a romanticized vision of the city, hence why she sees everything through rose-tinted glasses. In general, I think that the depiction of Paris works fairly well for the context of this series, but I would advise easily-offended French people to watch something else.In the end, Emily in Paris delivers on most of the what its premise promises : a good, silly romance story, engaging characters and, most importantly, a trip to one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I believe that there is no question that Netflix will renew this thing for a second season in the coming weeks, and I will be watching when that happens."
436,"I was annoyed the first two episodes too, but then you get the hang of it; the cheesiness, the main character's American white girl caricature and all the clishes about Paris and French people. It's ultimately smarter than you'd think, but otherwise mainly a very light, easy to watch and uplifting show a stunning location obviously and great costumes."
437,"I was rowing through the Vikings series for the second time when my wife sat down and said ""Lets watch something else."" Ok it was over to Netflix and the first thing that popped up was Emily in Paris. ""Oh lets watch this one"" she said. God, I was thinking , here we go.
Seven episodes later we called a halt to the binge. What a sexy , funny , top quality production. Everything about this series is right. Guys there are enough hard sexual reference blurts in the dialog, enough top notch acting, humor, fashion, and storyline to keep everyone happy. (Yes, I said fashion. I blame myself.). Its a chick flick , but lighten up and try it , its good."
438,"Great light watch to make you forget about anything, really relaxing. I enjoy Lilly Collins's perfomance as well as Gabriel, Silvie and Luk."
439,"Peaceful, lovely and beautiful. It is a beautiful amalgamation of American and French culture. That nonchalance of Emily (American) coupled with Sylvie's defiant take on things (French) made it adorable. It seemed like although American were not a welcome guest in French bubble in the starting but some cute little incidents made French to like this intrusion and it turned out to be an awesome chemistry.
merci"
440,"If you are looking for some harmless switch the brain off entertainment then this show is it.
It is very predictable superficial and cliches abundant
The lead is likeable in an annoying way have to say her fashion sense is cringeworthy I have never really understood the attraction that people have for Influencers ? To be honest I am not into the whole social media selfie hype .It's ok I have watched a lot worse 😆"
441,"If I were French I'd take to the streets to demand Darren Star & Lily Collins be banned from ever entering the country again. 3 of the stars are for the lovely shots of Paris, which tells you how bad this is."
442,"She's pretty, it's Paris so it's inevitably beautiful, and the clothes are cute but that's it. It's so bad, and uncomfortable. Almost every scene made me cringe, Darren star has lost all direction from sex and the city. Honestly I think it's not Lily's fault it's just bad directing, but idk it's just a mess. The whole thing is dumb."
443,"Could have been a real charming show but writers unnecessarily added a snideness that detracted from the show. The derogatory comments about Chicago as well as the Parisian people were not needed. Emily came charging into her new work environment without any sensitivity to her surroundings and thought every problem, mostly created by her inexperience, could be solved with a selfie and social media, Lily Collins is a talented actress and she did the best she could to make this character likable and rootable, despite little help from the writing team. Show finally improved around episode six for those who stuck around that long."
444,"Every set of Lily's outfit is amazing ,it's the only thing I enjoy to watch this TV series.
Overall this is a drama that doesn't deserve my attention.
My life should be spent on more wonderful things."
445,"I loved the character emily and gabriel. And what can I say about sylvie? She is glamorous. I want more emily and gabriel chemistry . I really am looking forward to season 2. I hate camille. This is capable of 7.5 actually but worth of watching. I loved Emily's presence of mind,cuteness and charmness. Return soon emily...😘😘"
446,"I haven't been this excited about a show since Gossip Girl. Collins plays the American in Pais perfectly! All the acting is on point. Great fashion. Beautiful cinematography. The creators really bring Paris to your living room. The only thing I will say, I wish there was more French when two French speaking characters are talking."
447,"American girl educates rude, sexist, backward, lazy Frenchies."
448,I could not stop watching !!! Made me laugh and smile from ear to ear constantly. The cast is amazing and how is everyone so beautiful/handsome?! Really hope this show is renewed for another season and more following.
449,"A perfect movie for a quiet evening. I really liked the combination of fashion, friends, love and comedy."
450,"A truly brilliant show. The comedic timing is perfect, the storyline keeps you hooked, and of course; Lily Collins makes it such an easy watch!"
451,"It's friken amazing, thank you for filling the SATC/GG void."
452,"It was so fun to watch that I finished the whole season in one go!! Made me happy when I watching the whole time and the all cast members were amazing!!
Waiting for season -2 wanna know what Camille has to say 😅"
453,"As an American who has lived in Paris, I loved it. So relatable. The culture clash issues and language jokes were so on point. And it's true, you really don't go to Paris to behave. It was very entertaining, bright, colorful, witty and full of life in all its ups and downs. It was a delightful distraction from this catastrophe that has been 2020."
454,"I mean I'm a diehard gossipgirl lover.But I think Emily might just end my obsession with Blair finally.Finished the entire season and now I have to go to work without getting any sleep, totally worth it though. 10/10"
455,"I truly don't understand anybody who finds this show enjoyable. This was the most cliched, uninspired, unfunny show that I've seen in a loooong time and it's mind boggling that it came from the man who created Sex and the City. I can honestly say that I feel little to nothing for these characters as far as empathy and warmth is concerned. Oh, and the acting is atrocious, even you Lily Collins. And since I've already brought up Sex and the City, it really felt like certain parts of the show were being forced to try create that 'fabulous single woman vibe in a big city' that was so adored in SATC but fell completely flat in this train wreck. For example, the ridiculous costume design. At least Carries weird outfits had soul - these were downright embarrassing and desperate (sorry Patricia Field). The relationship with the friend who's name I've forgotten and don't care to relearn. They really tried to create some witty banter and snappy Samanthaesque one liners between this pair, but surprise surprise, it didn't work. Of course this show isn't meant to be the next Sopranos or anything so I can appreciate the escapism or whatever it is people have been using to justify their liking of this dumpster-fire, and I will admit that I did watch the entire thing in one day, so it is watchable, even if you are counting down the minutes until it will finally end. In conclusion, if you want to hear some bourgeois women talking like gay men while wearing Miu Miu, just rewatch Sex and the City."
456,"Seriously. Is this the sort of tat the kids are watching nowadays. I guess so by the ratings.
The show is So fake, like everyone is and portrays their lives nowadays I suppose. And the acting is really poor. I mean really really poor.Only close thing is how rude the french are in it."
457,"FUN FUN FUN..
absolutely can't wait till the season 2."
458,"...And then Americans are coming to Europe to save Europeans and bring innovations. I don't have anything agains cliches (Queen's Gambit was also full of it but done in nice manner), but those in Emily are just annoying, full of culture stereotypes and caricatures of nation seen only from other side of pond. At least French people are speaking english otherwise poor Emily would need to use google translate throughout whole season."
459,"Let's get some things straight, here. This show has been in the news recently, getting absolutely bashed every which way, for all sorts of reasons. I have two main things to say to those especially negative critics:
1. While I respect that people have different opinions, the fact remains, ""Emily in Paris"" is fictional. The character, as basic and stereotypical as she might be, is completely made up.2. Despite anyone's personal feelings on Lily Collins's talent, this show is not ""her fault,"" and this is a gross oversimplification. Yes she co-produced it, but I'm certain she worked alongside other important crew.I respect people who are passionate about TV and film; as I'm definitely one of them! But I believe there is a big difference between passion and hate. One is simply mean-spirited and hurtful, and the rise of the internet has made all kinds of hate (and I do mean all kinds!) terribly common.Bottom line, this show exists as entertainment. It's not a manual for Americans in Paris, it's not representative of every single Parisian resident in the city. It's a light, fluffy show that is intended to entertain. Are some aspects annoying, such as Emily's almost-refusal to learn/speak French? Sure. Her amazing designer wardrobe, even though she's quite literally brand-new to Paris? Maybe.
(I'm not much of a fashion girl.)This is a lighter, tamer ""Gossip Girl Goes Abroad"" type thing. Are we picking at Serena Van der Woodsen and Blake Lively next, for being a ditzy blonde with substance abuse issues? Wouldn't that characterization hurt the reputation of beautiful blondes everywhere, since substance abuse isn't synonymous with hair color, right? I mean, that's absurd. What about Blair's queen bee, ultra-controlling attitude? Doesn't the original ""GG"" focus in on the NYC elite? But surely not all NYC students are as sharp and scheming as Blair, in real life...It's called suspension of disbelief. Most entertainment requires it, but especially the good stuff. Not that ""Emily in Paris"" (or ""GG"" for that matter) is an especially hard-hitting show, but you know, most of the time, when I sit down to choose a show, I don't want realism. Documentaries and the like certainly have their place, but on a Saturday night, or a lazy afternoon, maybe I actually want something fun. This year has been difficult enough, after all.That's what ""Emily in Paris"" is: a quick, light show one can watch with maybe only half their brain, if they so choose. I personally don't expect a second season here, and I wouldn't be heartbroken if it's a one and done.
Lastly, for the record, I do like Lily Collins, both as an actress and a person. :)"
460,"The first Episode was really tough to watch, but after that I found myself totally drawn to the stunning scenery of Paris is worth it just on it's own. It has fabulous over the top characters and great plot lines! This is a really easy, funny enjoyable watch. Its not super complex, has neat storylines that resolve themselves with in the 30mins, whilst slowly unpacking the bigger story. Has great unexpected twists without being too over the top. ""Emily"" grated on me the first 2 episodes, but after that she just becoame totally adorable! This is perfect Covid viewing, true escape from the banal 2020 year that's been. When you can't leave your home, this is a beautiful place to park your mind, and reminisce about places you've been!"
461,"This is fun, easy series to watch and brings back good and fun memories from when I lived in Paris for 8 years as a foreigner and who is a person that still love the city and the people there.We actually got addicted to it and watched the first 5 episodes to start with!I am though surprised and shocked to see reviews of 1 and 2 stars because people fell that the serie is making fun of the Parisians....get a grip... rate the show based on the quality of the cast, story etc. and just enjoy the humour."
462,"I don't get it why this series has so many bad reviews. The story is simple: American girl comes to Paris to start a job there. You could see this through that she will meet some handsome man, she fell for one, but it'll be difficult. And there's always a happy ending. This is what it supposed to be a simple story.This is perfect to relax in the evening (or whole day) and just enjoy. Do not look for deep meaning. I love that they made some dialogues in french, but in my opinion not enough! Like when Antoine talks with Gabriel in english even though there's no Emily around so they can easily speak in their origin language which is FRENCH! But I think this is normal with American TV :)I binged in two days and I definately recommend it. And... did you see Lucas Bravo's eyes? I'm a sucker for blue eyes and french accent :)"
463,"This show is terrible. There's no other way to describe it. The dialogues are bad, the characters are shallow and annoying, the story makes no sense, there's no progression or growth in the plot or the main character, the fashion (which was supposed to be good) is just tacky and sad, minorities in general are either nonexistent or caricaturized, and on and on. Most importantly, the stereotypes about French people and French culture in general are just very offensive. So offensive in fact that me, a non-French rom-com fan, found it unbearable. Please spare yourself the distaste and do not waste your time with this garbage. It is not worth it and you'll never get your time back."
464,"I gave 5 just for Paris, clothing and I liked Emily, but the story is absolutely not interesting at all.. I could have been a lot better with a little bit of imagination. Would not recommend!"
465,"Initial reaction is nicely produced, good storyline and interesting characters. The lead is attractive and carries part well. However, the lead has been miscast as she appears way too young for the part."
466,"Having spent some time in Paris in my early teens ,it brought back lovely memories of my favourite city .Lily Collins ( Phil Collin's daughter ) was excellent and her clothes were more stylish than Villanelle from Killing Eve.I enjoyed it and Intend to visit Paris again."
467,"I'm far too old to be watching this series, it's for bright young things who are influenced by fashion, the number of Instagram followers someone has, and who's screwing who. But it's an escape from the ghastliness of a pandemic and all other world ills. The shots of Paris are fantastic - even though the script is glib and full of cliches, and everyone wears a different outfit every day - but I just couldn't stop watching it."
468,I enjoyed it. If youre in the mood for something easy going and light hearted this is an easy watch. Everyone thinks their critics and can't enjoy a show for what it is.
469,"Think: Sex and the City (in Paris)
Great cast. Very funny. Entertaining throughout."
470,I really thought that I'm gonna watch something different than usual.. It's not bad but there were a lot of things missing..
471,Really enjoyed it apart from the fatphobic comment/joke in the first episode. Great show and lots of fun. Give it a watch and ignore the comment in the first episode.
472,"Wife's away for the week so nothing to do but do some tv bingeing. miss travelling due to covid so Paris caught my eye. also love Lilly Collins but wasn't expecting much. surprise surprise, well done. characters were interesting. writing was good. storyline was interesting each episode. locations were great, not just famous touristy spots. brought back great memories. c'est bon."
473,"When I first started watching this drama, it was because I didn't know what to do during my lunch break in college.At first it didn't seem that interesting, but I just couldn't stop watching it. The show is very well written and well produced, the actors also did an amazing job which is one of the reasons why I couldn't stop watching the show.While I was watching the show, it made me really want to go and see Paris for myself which is why I watch most of shows. I want ""I need to go there and see for myself"" type of feeling when I watch a TV Show or Movie. Emily in Paris gave me that feeling.I would definitely recommend this show to my friends."
474,"Its easy, entertaining watch with beautiful backdrop of paris. This is not the series to be taken seriously.. just sit back, take popcorn and enjoy..Welcome break in the world of dark thrillers or super realistic series.."
475,This is such a great show! I hope they bring out more seasons. Definitely recommend.
476,"The show overall is good. The acting, scenery of Paris is great. But there were some disappointments. Tell me where was comedy in this whole season? Most of the jokes made were not funny atleast not to me. There were also some incorrect stereotypes made for French people. The writers should really have studied the culture and norms of French people closely before writing this story. Overall I will say you can watch this if you don't have anything else to watch and want a quick time pass because episodes are not that big."
477,This show was fun and easy to watch. I enjoyed every minute of it. Please have more seasons.
478,"I watched all episodes in a morning. I'm not French or American so I feel this drama funny and relaxing. I can predict what characters are going to do. I can get some knowledge of fashion industry. This drama is good but 1 thing I can't understand, that how can Emily has sex with strange guys randomly after a casual talk and ignores better guys around her everyday? Am I not open enough to get it?"
479,"Light, fun,and good for day time, just don't come with big expectations,"
480,"Of course I immediately saw this show because of the fashion, but wow!! I just fell in love with it. It's quirky, funny, sexy & well the fashion did not disappoint! This show has major potential & the fact that Darren star is involved, well that made it even better! This definitely has the potential to become that new generation of Sex & the City esq type of show & I truly hope they continue with it because that ended in such a cliff hanger!!!!"
481,"I know this is a fictional representation of an American in Paris, but it was light-hearted and warm. It was reminiscent of Sex and the City! I hope it gets picked for another Season or two, I want to find out what is in store for Emily in the future!"
482,"There's really not a lot to say about this show. It's about a girl named Emily, who moves to Paris. Yup, that's it.Okay, there's a little bit more, but it's not much. The main character, Emily, is a cliche ""basic white girl,"" whose ignorance, arrogance, and privilege makes it difficult to sympathise with or relate to her. She moves to Paris for her job, without knowing any French (???), and adapts to life in France while trying to maintain relationships with her new and old friends and romantic interests. I think the writers were trying to make her quirky, and relatable, but in my opinion, her lack of awareness and common sense just comes off as annoying and unlikable.Furthermore, the show relies pretty heavily on cliches and stereotypes about France and French people (example: everyone smokes and is a total a-hole). The whole portrayal of Paris is through a very American view, which makes for decent escapism, but doesn't work well for accuracy.Plus, I know this doesn't really affect the plot or acting (which wasn't that great either), but there are barely any people of colour in the show, minus the East Asian best friend she meets on a park bench (why??) I really don't get why in this day and age, we can't get more shows featuring people of colour as the main characters instead of privileged white girls, but I guess that's life."
483,"As someone who has traveled to Paris, I can see why people might be turned off by the idea that it isn't actually represented accurately, but when is it really unless it is a documentary? This show actually isn't bad, it shows how a person appreciates French culture and wants to be immersed in it even when she's really bad at it. I didn't see anything wrong with it and can't say it turned me off from ever going back to Paris, in fact it did the opposite. This is just a light hearted show for ENTERTAINMENT not a National Geographic one. Give it a chance!"
484,Love this show so much. The characters are all so fun and I can't wait for more seasons
485,"This tv-series is delightful and I love the way they handle romance during a flowing current of drama. Yes, it has it's ""Oh, come on-."" moments but well, I see that as an element that brings everything together. I mean if it's too realistic the whole thing would be boring and heck, the character Emily would fall apart."
486,"I dont understand the bad reviews....really.
Its a fun small show. 25/30 nice minutes to leave the stress of life behind.
Hope there's a 2nd season."
487,Love this movie. fresh air and not complicated. Enjoyable and It makes me wanna go to Paris. :)
488,"Loving that it's set in Paris, showing of course only the loveliest parts; giving us Americans a little escape. But wishing our main character had more maturity. I would like the series to have the sex appeal, intelligence and wit of ""Sex and the City"". It simply doesn't compare. I feel like it sits in an awkward place between Sex and the City, Devil wears Prada and a Disney channel series. And the cliches oh dear lord the cliches! Our lead female, the stereotypical ignorant entitled social media obsessed narcissistic American princess; who of course has handsome Frenchmen falling at her feet and wins everybody over with her quirky charm, pleeeeez! (insert eye roll here). And the next door neighbor with movie star good looks available to her day and night to save the day at every turn and get her out of her constant melodramatic crises; and of course he falls in love with her duh! And if you didn't know, ALL parisians are rude. They ALL smoke. They are ALL impeccably dressed. They ALL own art galleries, chateau's, produce champagne, or are chefs, couture designers, jazz singers or artists. The show is pure fantasy and that's okay. Will I Google the release date of season 2? Hell no. Will I binge it when it pops up on netflix? Sure"
489,"I really tried to like it and it's ok, pretty light, but nothing special and missing debth, especially in the characters"
490,"Very europe from an american point of view, just so many clichés. it's also way too idealistic and she's pining after a new guy almost every episode which is super annoying"
491,"When I saw the trailer and read the description I thought what we all did,that it will be something like sex and the city of the sort. Well after 3 episodes I can clearly see that this has nothing to do with the former besides of course fashion. I don't know if it's because I've seen so many movies or series but I find the story and characters blunt predictable forgettable. I get that it might be the trend nowdays to exaggerate and create characters ,situations and dialogues that are unrealistic in order to create laugh? but i cannot feel it.I find impossible to connect with the characters which is after all the main ingredient of success if you take into mind the series and movies Emily in Paris wants to look like - Devil wears prada and Sex and the City or even Friends (like one said althought i dont see any similarities there but it is the series its fans got so connected with its characters the most).
Do if you are into fashion ,always dreamed of visiting Paris(great pictures of city butbeven those seem fake)and if you like Lily Collins which is adorable and sexy btw then you might be into this.But if we are gonna be serious with so great series to watch and not so much time to waist it feels really feels like a waste of time.
Ps.Young girls will love it but is it would bebgreat if they where the only targeted audience ."
492,"I'm a senior American male and I enjoyed the cleverly whimsical story told about Emily. However after binge-watching the series (over a period of a few days), I took to seeing how others responded. There, I found a number of reviews containing the same smugness that the show highlighted. It's quite ironic to me how these ""critics"" fell right into the theme of the series they were critiquing. Sure, there were stereotypes and cliches in the story but to me they were used cleverly to create an outrageously delightful tale. Vive la difference!"
493,If you were a fan of Ugly Betty you'll love this show. Emily is in over head and gradually makes friends. These characters come with their own baggage which only adds to the fun. Like a good book it leaves you wanting more. I hope there is a season 2!
494,"I really like this movie. finally after a long time, i'll be waiting for movie like this. This is amazing,incredible, and totally badass for all the actresses. Lily collins always bring the joy to the room everytime i see it. Loved it! I WANT MORE SEASON AND EPISODE!! please make more episode!! I just need one day for binge this movie,i need more.... please......;)"
495,"The only saving grace of this series is the breathtaking cinematography, paris is beautiful. One can watch this series as a fun going without rhyme or reason stuff which is somewhere near to a humor."
496,"It's just Paris!
It's beauty, fashion, food, magic, places and everything beautiful.
Why focusing on the clingy side of story or any unrealistic thing about it!
Just enjoy the fun and beautiful atmosphere"
497,It's romantic and funny. Can't wait for next season!
498,"This show is the type of thing the average american left leaning young woman dreams of.
Empty, no substance, not funny either."
499,"Congratulations to Lily Collins for producing and starring in this series! It's a wonderful show. Paris scenery! Clothes are brilliant, wonderful music, delightful character in Emily, just fun! Didn't want it to end! Please do another season!"
500,"Like OmG LooK a t mE InStGrAm iS LiFe cute. 2000 was 20 years ago, and the whole #positivity-happily ever after-everything will be okay-romcom trope is an outdated concept, yet because it has been so long, it's a nice refreshment if you are weary with every woke series in literally everything. You might like this if you're an influencer, or haven't been beaten down by life, or just looking for an escape in 10 episodes."
501,"The show had all the elements to be a captivating show about a girl who moves to Paris for a challenging new job where she has to deal with a different culture with fun and beautiful clothes but NOOOO. The story is not adequately developed because it falls in too many culture cliches that makes the story almost boring. If they want a kind of ""Sex and the city"" in Paris, they should have focus on Emily's outfits because she looks almost trashy. I have no idea what they were trying to show but too many expectations for a show with a great cast, a great city, a great photography but a lousy story and costume design (at least for Emily. The rest of the cast looks amazing)."
502,"All I liked about this series was its soundtracks. Other than this, the plot is too cliche and awkward."
503,This series is utterly ridiculous. Don't watch It's waste time.
504,"First of all it really sad that the show is about fashion when the fashion feels from 2012 .second, i didn't enjoy the vibes of the Series.However, i start enjoying it a little bit at the end. I Guess if there's another part with better 2020 fashion and better story line it might get a higher rate ."
505,Easy show to bingewatch on a sunday. Watched it with my boyfriend 2 weeks ago and enjoyed it. Can not say the serie is really interesting but nice to watch when you got nothing else to do and just want to hangout and chill :)
506,Some refreshing content to watch in the crisis you can watch it to have some refreshment it's unreal in some parts but it's a fictional story so don't mind it just sit back and enjoy it
507,Highly recommend this show. Got addicted to it immediately!Just wish it had more seasons. Looking forward to future seasons.
508,"This is a funny and very watchable show. Yes, it is clichéd and cheesy (and a bit too mean to the French, they aren't really like that), but it is not a documentary about life in Paris, it is a fantasy light comedy. My wife and I both really enjoyed it. The cast are all excellent, especially the lead, and Paris...is Paris!"
509,"It is just the marketing in what my country stating it's a hit and must watch. Apparently it's targeting female audience and whom did like Paris and fancy of French men. If u hit one of the above, you will love it. But not me. I like Lily Collins though."
510,Watch it for the fun of it..not the plot. Its a cute series and Lily is very pretty and have not seen her comedic side before.
511,Get ur facts right Emily. Could have had potential if it wasn't so forced and quick with the story set up. Gotta establish the character
512,"I was all set to hate this after reading the reviews but I have to say that at about episode 5 my suspension of belief kicked in and I was actually kind of hooked. The problem is those first few episodes really do test anyone's patience with cliche after cliche, improbable situation after improbably situation and trope after trope. If you can make it through to episode five then you just might find yourself warming to the plucky Emily and her not-so-exciting script.It's primarily a ""fashion"" show but the odd thing is that Emily is the one who doesn't look that great. I'm not a massive fashionista but it's just not working for her, which is strange, because it works for all the other female characters and particularly for the males ones too. But I have to say the nanny wearing high heels while looking after the kids just makes me angry.So I say give Emily a chance. There's no way this series will last for long and it might just be the quick, forgettable Parisian fling you need before the next true crime doco/racially charged drama/show starring 90s comedians comes across your radar."
513,"So I watched it over the weekend and it's refreshing new story.
Ya it's little teenish but who doesn't want to experience it back again.
Specifically Emily's idea and thoughts are written perfectly.
I love the little but many parts of happiness and sadness love and guilt and wanting to be loved wanting a perfect surrounding. I kind of love it...
Waiting for another season... I love it ..."
514,"So many things are wrong about this show. First I don't think it is very funny, or romantic, which is sad for a romcom. Then it is filled with clichés and visions of a very rich Parisian lifestyle, which clearly forgets about the 99% of us Parisians who wouldn't complain about Emily's ""tiny"" apartment, which is quite big for a single person in Paris, and probably costs more than the minimum salary. Also, she never takes the metro (seriously ?).
Men all seem completely gross, and even though I agree there is some truth on sexism in France being what it is, but this is over the top... (from a personal point of view I felt way more harassed at work when I lived in the US).
Among all the clichés there are a few relevant things, like the fact that we complain a lot, but I regret that they insisted so much on details like how we count floors or reverse dates.
Lily Collins does deliver a great performance despite poor writing.
So, if you expect some cultural immersion I suggest you watch something else. If you want a light show with beautiful sights and dresses and a ""Devil wears Prada"" vibe, go for it."
515,"Just to help with an opinion: I never went to the States instead I lived in Paris and I happen to know a fair number of French people and met some Americans: I never saw people dressed the way the characters are , whichever side of the Atlantic! I've never visited the Vogue hub though...French people are casually dressed yet with a sense of style (or at least tasteful) which is innate. You want extravaganza? Go in Italy! French people are far more modest in the way they dress. So all these outfits -especially those of Emily are misplaced; also makes you wonder how could the character afford them, changing them every day aso. Lilly Collins has a special beauty ( that evoques that of Audrey Hepburn) which in itself would have sufficed for the charm of the character. Instead her apparitions look more like a Christmas tree and make you also wonder if Gabriel has fallen in love with the person she is or he has been razzle-dazzled by the show she makes each time she appears!
This is in sharp contrast with the freshness, the genuine nature and the positive side of the character - which makes the costume choice all the more inadequate.Quite caricatural acting from the part of Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu which does not compliment the French fussiness.Interesting to see a character displaying a love for the hard social media (Instagram) and not suffering from narcissism or falling into derision as real-life Instagram VIP's are. Makes you wonder if this is only possible in a movie...If you want an in-between Legally Blonde - The Devil wears Prada and Sex and the City, this is it.All in all, for a dull a depressing period like the one we are living, it's worth watching: it's colourful, dynamic, fresh and makes you travel freely and take a blink at a maybe -possible-again normal world."
516,"Nice comedy, which starts a bit slow but as the characters grow it becomes sometimes really funny.
Shots from Paris are great, but if you have never been there, don't be shocked if it is a bit different.
Enjoy, especially episode 8. This is full of word jokes"
517,"The French are the lovers of the story, Emily is the famme fatal of the show, with many men interested in her, it does remind Samantha from the Sex and the city. Even though the unity of a number of friends is missing and there is alot of back stabing with the characters, it does help the story evolve smartly and keeping the interest undying. This series has great potential and it will certainly surprise us as it moves on. I watched all the episodes and found it beautiful with the scenories changing and the story of love partners renewing the story and turning it into something different and exciting."
518,"Will someone please tell ""Sylvie"" to wear wrist braces and learn to walk like she's not stepping in knee-high mud. She acts like a grandmother."
519,"I thoroughly ejoyed this series. Lily Collins is always so watchable. I love Paris and enjoyed seeing so many of the places that I visited several years ago. It's truly one of the most beautiful cities in the world. This show isn't serious and isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's entertaining, romantic and fun. That's exactly what I needed when I binged this in 2 days! Ignore the low ratings... some people just review negatively because they take themselves much too seriously. Sad."
520,"I finished it in one day only. It is sooo charming and made me think I wanna go work in Europe.
I loved all the challenges that Emily went through and was able to overcome them.
Loved Gabriels relationship with Emily alot."
521,"Spoiler
It is easy to say that this show has a fun momments even theres no sense about some char like gabriael that he refuse the help from his gf family and accept it from another personSomething else , I didnt go to france and i dont know there culture but this show made us saw them like not likble people and they just thinking about the sex and double relationships i didnt know is that true or not but i'm not a fan of this story tellingBut if i think about this whole 10 ep it was fun as not complicated show the jokes are really good espically those who contain emily talking wrong or dealing with the american tradionsI had an issue with last ep felt like more fast and not setled upbut To be honest i was expected more bad than this but i enjoy watching emily of paris and the idea of making this 30 min was perfect help me to not feel boradI think the ending open a door for another season for me i would like to saw it"
522,"This mainly consists of Lily Collins, smiling, making facial expressions, taking selfies and coming up with one line ideas, that turn into brilliant successes. The premise is stupid because no one who couldn't speak French would get a key job with a high-end advertising company in Paris, to start with. Then it's about as cliched and predictable, as one could imagine."
523,It kept me watching for my paris nostalgia and mindless entertainment that is so needed in 2020...but the whole show is just plain dumb and a shameless plug for Instagram.
524,"If you like a confession of a shopaholic, devil wears prada, intern, mean girls, you probably like this show too. Light, fresh, funny, charming. Don't expect too much..but this show is great"
525,"After the first episode with all the nonsensical French stereotypes I was certain this series was going to suck, but I persevered because if there's one thing Netflix does well, it's costumes and set design - which are spectacular in this series. As Emily""s adventure unfolds, the characters become increasingly lovable, the story predicable but super fun, with its sexy Parisienne setting and let's be honest, Lily Collins is hands down the sweetest, most watchable girl in Hollywood right now. With more handsome French gentlemen vying for her attention than she can handle - season 2 should be more saucy than le Coq au Vin at Gabriel's new restaurant!"
526,"Dismayed to watch the (mostly French based) negative reviews of this adorable Valentine to Paris. It *is* part Sex/City and part Devil/Prada but with the adorable star and her terrific wardrobe, wow this frothy comedy took me right back to my own single adventures (alas, stateside) and how lovely it was to be young and game for anything! To the meanies, stop finding what's wrong with the series and find what's so sweet, a perfect antidote to all the crime dramas on Netflix and all the scary virus stuff in reality. Well done, Darren and Lily!!"
527,Hope all the cast return for the next season. This show is amazing!!
528,"I watched this series because I'm kind of tired with heavy storyline series and this series is just so fresh and light. I really enjoyed my time watching this. Just like what other reviewers have said, this is cliché and predictable but I'm still loving it."
529,"Living in such a dark time with the Pandemic and bad news on the TV everyday, Emily in Paris is the perfect distraction when you are unable to make a trip past work or the grocery store. A lovely quaint and refreshing tale of living an exciting life that's not your own. Lily James is delightful as Emily. The other characters are great as well. Emily's outfits are on point. Tonight , I think I will dream of eating a chocolate croissant, wearing an amazing outfit everyday and living an exciting life with an adorable chef next door to teach me French the French way. I may take famous fashion designers out for dinner. I might let my hair blow in the breeze as I travel with great friends in a red convertible to Champagne to sample the delicious scenery and a delightful vintage."
530,Emily in Paris @emilyinparis on @netflix Super LOVE! It's produced and created by Darren Star of Sex & the City. Lily Collins as Emily Cooper who i liked from the movie Love Rosie. And super love handsome Lucas Bravo as Gabriel the Chef! Enjoying escaping to Paris and outside the city through Emily.
531,"Can't wait for season 2. Yeah Lilly looks younger than in her 30s that's a misser and sometimes confusing if you see her dating older man, but for the rest I loved it!"
532,"It's refreshing to see a half hour show that's not a sitcom. But just like most sitcom episodes, Emily in Paris lacks an overall plot to be developed or even stakes. Everything goes Emily's way in the end every time, all the guys love her, her ideas are always the best and it looks like her closet never ends. And that's the problem. It's all too perfect, always."
533,Love it cant wait for season 2 its something different and fun romantic
534,"Excellent show light hearted entertainment, amusing, also loved the characters, Carrie Bradshaw eat your heart out!! Get over yourselves bad reviewers!!"
535,"Yeah, it's mostly fluff, but it can be very entertaining, especially as you get to know the characters. For these times, it's a great diversion. Ashley Park is especially good as Mindy, as are the rest of the French cast. There are some old worn out clichés, of which I'm sure some are tired of. But there are some genuine laughs. It's fluffy. And sometimes you just need fluff. It's good fluff. Okay, enough fluff."
536,I L O V E D every moment of this show! I didnt want it to end! I was so drawn to the characters in this. Very well scripted! I look forward to watching season 2!!
537,Lily Collins en todo su esplendor. Para los amantes de la moda y los viajes es la serie ideal. La vi toda de corrido. Te atrapa.
538,"I like Lilly Collins, she is kind of a girl crush after Emilia Clarke and I wanted to like this but I can't.
Gabriel and the beautiful shots of Paris are saving it but it's not funny, desperately trying to be cute, but comes across as intolerant and ignorant.She accepts the Parisian job despite of not knowing French nor anything about the culture.
She wants to ""force"" her boyfriend to accept this without actually talking about it, then making him look like he's the bad one.
She thinks she can just bang on her neighbour's door anytime when she needs help as she doesn't speak French, regardless of the hour.
Ok, probably I would ask for his help too ;)
She is way too PC to live in France, she doesn't understand that being a woman doesn't mean men are sexist and you are an object.And the worst part probably, she tries to change their way of thinking to a work-obsessed unhappy American way of thinking without actually trying to understand the differences in the cultures.
As in episode 2 Julian says ""we work to live, you live to work""This show is full of cliches, nothing original about it, and a PC, feminist garbage.It's okay to watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon when you need some colours in your life and you couldn't find anything better."
539,"Loved this new series - Gives you a great feel for the city of Paris
Lead actress is superb as is the supporting cast
Great settings around Paris and good storyline - Recommended"
540,"This show is soooo good, I loved it! The scenes are so beautiful, the clothes is very chic and Lily is great, I definitely recommend it :)"
541,A very sweet drama worth spending a saturday night at home. Grab your wine and reserve this weekend for Emily. This series made me dream of Paris and wanted to learn French. I hope the new season will come soon. Profitez-en!
542,"A lovely light-hearted comedy. Ideal for that weekend after a tough week. Yes it's full of clichés but who cares? Watch it for what it is, no one's expecting Oscar performances or an accurate representation of life and everything in-between. Just escape to that picture perfect image of Paris, you know you want to. Not 10 stars because...yeah clichés ;)"
543,"Emily produced by 31 year old daughter of Phil, Lily Collins, looks and acts 17 as Emily.. But it is full of the best views of Paris by day and night! It is a Darren Star production but is not like his American hits.
It is fun for young people and those who like romance."
544,"This show randomly played on Netflix. I had no idea what was playing. I was so sad when the 10th episode was finished. I fell in love with all of the characters. It is fun, real, romantic and Bing worthy. I watched this in one day. I hope there will be a second season. Absolutely loved it!!!!"
545,"I really enjoyed watching this: it had jokes here and there and I was very impressed by the onscreen chemistry portrayed between Gabriel and Emily which made me want to keep watching to see what happens next. I was blown away by Lily Collins' performance as a stylish American newcomer in Paris and there definitely wasn't a moment where the storyline faded or I was bored while watching - it kept me with my eyes fixated on the screen until it ended. There was only two downsides I found - I do feel like the ""romance in Paris"" plot has been used a bit too much and even comes under the category of stereotypical to Paris now: It would have been nice to see a few other highlights of Paris shown other than the ""anything can happen in Paris"" concept. Also, I managed to binge watch this show in one day - that may have just been the fact that I was hooked on it but there were only 10 episodes, it felt like it was over way too quickly. Other than that, I really enjoyed it: I thought it was funny, romantic and I loved the fashion plot which included an inside look on the branding campaigns. It was also left on a great cliffhanger and I can't wait to see the next season!"
546,Loved it. Colorful. Refreshing. As an expat in Paris totally get Emily 😂 Waiting on Season 2.
547,And stays there. A cute and fun show. Lily Collins is adorable as Emily.
548,"If Darren Starr had taken the idiotic, self-absorbed, ignorant character a little more extreme, you would be laughing your ass off. It doesn't go far enough to do that, and I doubt he would be pulling all these stunts with the incredible supporting cast without that intention. It is like SATC-light. Needs balls. But incredible filming."
549,Why this show has 7.2 I don't understand the worst of worst
550,"So, I'm French, lived in Paris for over 20 years, anyone that says anything is cliché either got offended for being like that or has no idea what Paris is like.The show is fun, we really had a good time watching it and would love a second season.Is it the show of the year, no. But it still entertaining and so true about French people and especially Parisian. There are a few exaggeration but that's all."
551,"The best i have seen in a very long time. Watched 3 episodes a night after the first two and Can not wait for season 2. This had spice, humor and made sense, almost always, especially if you have lived with both Americans and Europeans."
552,"I was really surprised by the acting skills of the whole cast. Lily Collins look gorgeous, and she is very enjoying. Movie is based in Paris! Scenery is beautiful...,streets,cafeteria. Whole bunch of different scenes, really unique outlook. And movie is not that cliche! Clothes of the whole cast are very fashionable and smooth in the same time. Highly Recommend for evening!
And... one or more wine are highly required ! This is Paris for god sake :)"
553,This show is much better than people are giving it credit for. Is it cliché? Yes but only in entirely intentional ways that make one smile even if for a second. I typically don't enjoy shows of this kind but I binge watched the first season in a day - seeing as the episodes are a tad less than a half hour a piece it was quite a quick watch. I'm hoping for a second season.
554,"Beautiful scenery, funny, chic flick style writing, short episodes, the list goes on. Not sure why people are bashing this show but I love it! Grab some wine and enjoy the story line of Emily in Paris. Live vicariously through Emily's life in Paris as a young marketing professional. Y'all, we need shows like this since we can't travel to Paris."
555,Love this show. It's funny and has tension between characters. The passion in the movie is great. Can't wait for the next season.
556,I really liked the show. It is super entertaining. I just do not understand the negative reviews it is getting. All those critics got it wrong. This is a tv show. Just like any other tv show. Fiction!!! Entertaining!!! The show is not a reality show. Stop telling us French are not like that or this. No one is judging you. Besides it isn't the first time movies or shows stereotyped people from other countries. How many French movies Had I watched where other nationalities had been stereotyped. Liven up please!!!! Can't wait to see season 2. .
557,"Personnally I like the series like that with duratio less than 30 min , this show is full of Happyness and Colors , its show the difference between the cultures especially the Americans and the French People , Also the importance of the social media in the marketing today
I hope that you like my Review"
558,"As a fan of Younger, (never made it onto the SATC train) I wanted so badly to like everything about this. But as each minute passed, I found myself more and more frustrated and disrupted by the lead's uncomfortable delivery of pretty much every line. A few more years of practice and coaching and she'll be just fine.Full disclosure, I lasted all of 1.5 episodes before I just couldn't take it any longer! We're living in the age of limitless options to bide time; no sense struggling through. Be picky.The 5 stars gained are for the premise and plot line. It's a semi-fresh perspective.... on an incredibly familiar tale."
559,I Love it soooo much. It is cliché but but amazing
560,"Having lived in France for many years for post-grad education and married to a Française for over 40 years, I know a thing or two about French culture. So I was eager to watch this show which I presumed would have fun with cross cultural differences and curious how they would work those differences into a plot line so necessary to sustain a series. I managed to get through three episodes before calling it quits.The show overall is silly and patched together. For example, what's up with random encounter with the all wise Chinese nanny teaching Mandarin to two preschoolers, who speaks PERFECT English (and presumably French as well)? Really?Many reviewers have commented on the over dependence on clichés but since that seems to be SOP for American films about France, no surprise there. The French main characters are all predictable: the suave client taken right out of a rum commercial, the overplayed gay coworker, the snooty female boss. All standard props for script writers with nothing to say.My objection is precisely there. This show has nothing to say. I was able to get through those three episodes by focusing on the fascinating Paris photography and remembering my time there."
561,"Adorable lift me up for sure! A fun to way to distract yourself, & see the beauty of Paris. A reminder that fashion & romance will one day make its way back to life."
562,Emily (Lily Collins) is such a optimistic and happy character. It was extremely fun to watch her antics at a markering firm in Paris.
563,"So this series is just what the world needed! Aesthetically pleasing with fun twists and unpredictability, yet somehow educating about the French culture and the Parisian personality. The characters are somehow pretty flat, no real depth in anyone. But as I said - JUST what we needed, nothing too heavy, a fictional world where there is a lot of drama concerning rich people problems like ""Which dress should I wear"".We all love us some true detective season one vibes, but sometimes we could use series like these, to ease our brain and just enjoy some fun light television. Well done"
564,Every episode is incredible. Love the cast. Love the acting. Im hooked! When is season 2????
565,Ignore the criticism of this and give a watch. I done full thing in 2 sittings.
566,"So full of cliches, it's just painful to watch. And don't get me wrong, the idea is good and I looove Lily Collins but this show make Paris and the people in it look like they are all super rich and/or in the 50's.
I mean, you can't have a French person say ""garce"" for ""bi**h"" No onetalks like that anymore. No one behave like Sylvie or Antoine.
Sexism and cheating on your spouse are a big deal in France just like in any other country.I live in Paris, two blocks away from where Emily lives in the show, I'm the same age as her and I don't know anyone who would eat breakfast, lunch and dinner out every single day or dress like she dress. She seems to only meet crazy rich people, not regular people, she's never seen in the Metro...
My point is : nice show, except if you are French. It might as well take place in Wonderland, somewhere that just isn't real."
567,"I'm here for it.
Super cute, fun and funny. Love the style of it all. It doesn't take itself too seriously."
568,"Quiet an obnoxious, cliche, shallow show. It's exactly what you think it is."
569,"I wish I could leave it at that. Big budget and gorgeous-looking but very almost-Disney television in its attitude and plotting and about 10 years too late (French companies do, in fact, use social media marketing). Meanwhile, the office dynamics seem imagined by a 13 year old and are more similar to those of ""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitters Dead"" and ""Simply Irresistible"" than ""The Devil Wears Prada."" The midwestern moxie and GenZ pluck of Emily are borderline irritating...as is her ignorance of most things French. Ashley Park and the actress playing Sylvie are great. It goes so fast, though, it's hard not to watch. It's like a box of macarons."
570,"I've only watch the first episode, but I'm appalled. I'm American. 100%. I've never lived in another country. However, I've been to Paris twice. I have several friends who are French and know people who live in France. This stereotype that French people are rude is horrible. I am frustrated by how the French are portrayed in this show. It is such a stereotype and it is ridiculous. Like I said, I've been to Paris twice - and I cannot wait to go back. Yes, I encountered some rude people. I also interact with rude people every single day in my own town. I also encountered so many friendly and helpful people who made my visits to France enjoyable and memorable that it makes my furious that anyone would continue this ridiculous stereotype. I'm do upset by this show because it's so close minded."
571,"It's dumb on so many levels, because it has many mistakes and goofs. It's cliche, Emily is annoying, she dresses really badly and please, if she's a social media marketing expert anyone can be. It is also not respectful to the french culture"
572,"I didn't mind Carrie's extravagant collection of shoes on a writer's income or Gloria's depiction as a loud and slightly too religious Colombian who knows her way around a gun... But this show has crossed the line to being straight-up offensive to French people and anyone with a brain, really. It wouldn't be half bad if it were a bit more down to earth (say, Emily could stay sad longer than one night over her broken engagement and the cheated-on what's-her-name lady would mind a bit that her husband has a mistress) and if all characters weren't caricatures. Really, watch the Hookup Plan instead. At least you'll be watching some real French people...."
573,"It's been a while since I've been looking for a light-hearted rom-com and finally, this show came to my life, obviously, I watched 10 episodes in one sitting cause we're on lockdown and my life is empty now, moving on to the less depressing news is that this show is light and funny and it just hits the spot, I felt a little of The Devil Wears Prada watching it so I absolutely adored it. trust me it is worth your time."
574,"Caught one episode with my grandma. The chick Emily is a marketer, but she sucks at it. As a marketing major graduating soon I'm offended and pissed. This is just another dumb show that makes marketers social media gurus only.This chick blogs and posts to social media. She is a BLOGGER OR INFLUENCER at best. Both are dumb attention seeking jobs. It's not marketing. And worst of all, she calls out the brand she represents in episode 2. A marketer for a company does not call out their own brand.I'd never watch this on my own, but it's garbage."
575,"I jumped on the bandwagon with this show, as all of my female friends loved it. Someone even said it was a mix of Sex in the city and Gossip Girl - which I love both!! The first two episodes reeled me in, I loved watching the main character develop and the funny situations she would get in, plus her cute French outfits. After that though, I got bored quickly. I would have liked it to be a bit more raunchy as it definitely was not close to sex in the city (i know the show does not claim to be) it just felt too tame and underwhelming - especially after being compared to so many iconic shows. I did not watch the last 2 episodes as I gave up but seeing the main character live an unrealistic lifestyle and have everything fall in to her lap whilst living the most perfect unattainable lifestyle made me feel no connection. I really did try!"
576,"I'm confused about how everyone is giving Emily so much hate. She's witty, does her job well, and she's NICE. The cliches make the show light and fun to watch. Obviously there's a bunch of French people giving this poor reviews for being ""too positive and easy going... unrealistic"". I think people are missing the point that this is on the cusp of sitcom without being totally sitcom cheesiness. And to suggest that we should close the boarders to anyone that doesn't speak the language is narcissistic as hell to say. She landed on that job incidentally. That's what makes it cute and fun."
577,"Why did I decide to watch this series? First of all, I really like Paris and I miss it during the global lockdown. The second reason is the fact, that a lot of people I know express quite different opinions to this series. According to some of them, this is the biggest fall of Netflix, because the whole story is based on stereotypes about French people. According to the others, Netflix just created another funny and absolutely captivating romcom. And, finally, I watched the series because of its creator - Darren Star, in hope to plunge into the world of beautiful dresses and up-to-date fashion details as it was in the Darren Star's most famous previous project - Sex and the City.Generally speaking, when I finished the series Emily in Paris I wasn't disappointed. Paris is a magnificent locale for movies, especially when we see it in pre-COVID times. However, I wish they could have shown a bit more of a real city, its modern diverse everyday life, not only the most popular Instagram's spots. To give an illustration of what I mean, let's look at Bibliothèque François Mitterrand or Bercy Village as the examples of modern public places. As for the disaccord in viewers opinions, I tend to disagree with those, who complain about falseness and stereotypes in the movie. Yes, every French man in Emily in Paris looks too handsome, but I would like to dwell on the fact that the genre of the show is the romantic comedy. I have also noticed a lot of real not obvious details in the show, sometimes funny (old bakers who always proudly correct pronunciation of foreign buyers), sometimes not so funny (when you have to lift a heave luggage to an additional floor, because French buildings have «zero» floor instead of the first floor). At the same time, unfortunately, the last project of Darren Star couldn't convey the same impression as Sex and the City. Notwithstanding equally beautiful locales (cozy Manhattan's streets and magnificent Parisian's boulevards), I find in Sex and the City more realism in the characters' interpretation and more thoughtful plot.On the whole, I could recommend Emily in Paris to the people who admire Paris and enjoy modern fashion. Also, for those, who have spent some time of their life in France as an expat, but only if they can remember this period with a strong sense of humor. I wouldn't recommend this series to the real fan of Sex and the City, to the native French people or to those who don't like romcom as a genre itself."
578,"So romantic and brilliant! Love the characters, the romance, the acting, fashion"
579,"Predictable, funny, lovely scenery and never a problem that's not fixed. Emily seems to have the skin of an elephant and never ending optimism, sleeps and kisses with whomever she pleases, with an almost inhuman level of energy and all this in high heels. Nice to watch while relaxing!"
580,"This became one of my favourite TV series , this show is like perfect travel show with romance , beutiful story , background music , excellent cast and comedy. You get attached to character Emily so quickly and the beautiful locations used will make you watch show many times . I just loved this show .
Those who loves thavel will definitely love this show but I'll definitely reccomend this show to everyone to watch at least once ."
581,"This serie is basically a marketing product itself designed to sell clothes and accessories to women/young ladies, promote Instagram and sell future trips to Paris. You're watching a disguised commercial !"
582,"I got a taste of Paris, but all thanks to the crew, show concept, and great cast.This had a feel of MTV production - as in it was with the times. Trends were on point and remarks were light and punchy.I enjoyed watching this show with a ton of relatability and humor involved."
583,"I love these type of shows! They might be cliché indeed but it's also funny and is making me laugh. There a so many fun, romantic things in this show that is making me want to keep looking at another episode! I for one cannot wait for the next season."
584,"There are many stereotyping for French people and culture, but it is fine as it is a story from an American perspective. The whole thing is simply, easy, funny and comfortable. Paris, the French language, glamourous dresses, various landmarks are just decorations, Lily Collins is the main reason for this success."
585,The story the outfits are devastated... but thank god Lily is gorgeous.
586,"I'm not a fan of the show due to it's lack of artistic aspects,and lack of interesting story. but i gotta admit, i really liked the right feminist perspective of the show, it's neither zero nor it's overdosed, it's just right. The right way to say hey, feminism is not a bad sexist movement,instead it's what the world needs at the moment for a balanced environment gender wise."
587,"Actress Lilly Collins is undoubtedly a standout in her role as Emily Copper in Netflix's Emily In Paris, it's just a shame the television show's plot doesn't do her any justice, like any...at all.The storyline of Emily In Paris is shifty to say the least, more often then not it leaves it feeling like a generic 2010's scrapped Gossip Girl mini-series, or better yet an underdeveloped fashion misery instead of fairytale. Yes Emily In Paris has it's moments with it's costume designing and charming good looks of it's cast, but even Lilly can't save this one. Moreover it just seems rather missable, I would recommend it to a younger audience who just wants to watch a girl fall in love in Paris, even if the way she did so makes absolutely no sense...like at all.Emily In Paris provides a watchable yet unlikeable storyline that doesn't really take off from any generic romance in Paris pre-existing plot lines, would've loved for the show to be more mature in it's approach and focus on one subject line and end goal as oppose to unneeded dialogue and changes."
588,"Well, I loved This Short TV Series and I Loved His Wonderful Ambience
and Lily Collins Performance , Simple and Great"
589,"It's littered with clichés and infuriating stereotypes, feels stretched a bit and suffers from a jarring transition between ""the fish-out-of-water Emily"" plot-line and the actual plot; but it has the charm of rom-coms we rarely get to witness in TV shows nowadays that's further bolstered by the radiantly amiable Lily Collins, and it has characters that are very easy to be invested in. Plus, it's addictively bingeable!(6.5/10)"
590,"Transcend your day to day life... I fully enjoyed my virtual visit to Paris. I L<3 VE the series! Acting is wonderful, plot is well done...I've been to Paris and I've worked at ad agencies and in marketing...true glimpse of the inside workings of advertising and marketing world. Thoroughly enjoying my virtual re-visit especially during travel restricted Covid World....enjoy!!"
591,"While full of cliches and stereotypes, which I can see how the French would not appreciate, it's a fun show as we follow Emily in a new world and builds her character. Again not a deep show but something fun to sit and relax and watch the romantic drama."
592,"Nothing more, nothing less. Worth to fall asleep to it."
593,"Just watch one episode and judge for your self, if its not your cup of tea (or champagne) then just dont watch it, no need to spill your merde all over it in comments because your feelings of a proud French were hurt"
594,"Emily in Paris - B+ (Memorable)The show is just a version of Paris, seeing through an American eye. I watched the show in one sitting on a lazy morning and found it throughly entertaining.All the backlash is unnecessary as Sex and the City was not the only New York and Upper East Side Manhattan in Gossip Girl is not the only Manhattan, people should just enjoy the show as it is just a fun rom com escape of our daily pandemic news filled life.I have to say show works better due to Lily Collins's effortless charm, witty one liners and great supporting cast. Give it a try, you'll not be disappointed. Can't wait for second season."
595,Lilly Collins character is well written. the Paris presented is the romantic gilded version and it works. Loose yourself in the youthful romantic series.
596,"They did not cutback on the scenery nor sex, yet they made it obvious what the problem with Paris is
"" the French attitude"""
597,"I absolutely loved this show, perfect amounts of paris, romance and friendship!! If your looking for for a chill with girlfriends tv shows- this is it!!!"
598,Watched the whole season in one go and loved it! For girls who lived gossip girl / The devil wears Prada and are looking for a new tv show
599,"A show full of energy, excitement and entertainment. One can watch it in one go. Loved it."
600,"Upbeat, easy to watch & relatable. It reminds me of whenever I travel to Paris for work. I love the characters. A lot of it is a cliché and predictable; but I think that's okay because it's funny. I love the wardrobe choices & the cinematography is great too.It's one of the best shows I've seen in a while. But then again I love this genre. Something about it gives me 'mean girls' vibes, and I think we really needed something like that as there aren't many. Love it!"
601,"It's a very direct, simple and fun show that puts in contrast US and French cultures. Despite running the risk of using too many clichès and stereotypes, it does show the difficulties of settling in another country, along with the good surprises.It's worth a try, and if you're familiar with both cultures you'll find many things to be true."

603,"Must watch its very fashionable smooth funny excited and not boring at all not even a minute
It will take you to another space"
604,"Funny,sexy beautiful camera work of an iconic city.when is next season being released."
605,"Such a funny, cute show. I really enjoyed it. Cannot wait for season 2!"
606,"Does it show stereotypes? Yes. Americans are silly and addicted to their phones. Parisians are rude and don't like Americans. Is it a light, silly show with beautiful scenery and likable characters, yes! With all of craziness of the world, I just want simple entertainment!"
607,"It was enjoyable as light entertainment but pretty predictable and full of outdated cliches and stereotypes about Paris and French people. Not once did I finish an episode wondering about what was going to happen next. As far as romantic comedies set in Paris go, there are way better shows than this, on Netflix too."
608,"Sure, it's a fantasy with preposterously beautiful people in extravagant dress, living out kitsch circumstances. But for me it is the most entertaining streaming series going right now. Loaded with charm, smart writing, and sharp insights, especially re. the comical clash of culture, American v. French."
609,Emily in Paris is an enticing story about a girl who moves away from her home country for job in Paris. It lightly describes the challenges one faces in a foreign land and how to work towards overcoming it. A bit of cliché but blends in well with the storyline.
610,"Just watched season one. Yes, it's a little corny with lots of generalizations and stereotypes. Yet, it's still entertaining and pretty funny at times.Now for the ""but"".... About two thirds of the way through the first season they turn Emily from an innocent, young girl just getting out of a long term relationship into someone that will jump into bed with every attractive Frenchman she meets. Typical Netflix."
611,Not too good not too bad. Funny sometimes and full of cliches in some episodes.
612,"Emily in Paris is the equivalent of a Beach Book read: minimal plot, you know what's going to happen, fluffy, light & fun. Great fashion & scenery (Paris & good looking men) & that's about it. Not Shakespeare, not garbage."
613,"Itis normal, so girlish, but miss Collins is so talented, I am so sure season 2 is comming, when? no idea but it will"
614,"You feel like going to Paris with this series, despite the portrait of French culture, which is what makes France special. Super easy to watch, not boring at all and with good pieces of comedy here and there. The clothing is impeccable and the places, restaurants and cafes are indeed a must visit next time you are in Paris! Acting could need a bit of improvement from some characters, this is NOT why you watch this tv series. Overall a good enough 2020's version of sex and the city (while I believe the content there was more developed). As a form of entertainment, this hit the spot."
615,"This TV show's scenario was promising, I expected to be as good as Sex & the City, but it's not.
It's fun to watch but very cliché, most of the actors are not very good in their roles, and the dialogues are very weak. Plus : for a tv show happening in France, I find it akward for the french characters to speak english between them."
616,"Dont expect anything interesting in this show
Just put it and you may mute it as well
And just enjoy the portraits of Paris"
617,"Billled as the Sex and the City for a new generation, it is lazy work from Darren Starr, Emily is no Carry Bradshaw starting with her clothes down to her attitude. It is sterotypical and so predictable (the vibrator sence was embarassingly so). However, Lilly Collins is lovely to look at, and the Parisi location is as ever stunning. Not sure what audience it is marketed at, however if you want something lighthearted worth a watch, but I certainly won´t be watching season 2 if it comes about."
618,"I mean its pretty nice and catchy but in some shots i noticed that when two French characters were speaking alone, they still speaks English..
Bt the vibes of the show is so nice makes you feel like men are still gentlemen in somewhere !"
619,"Your typical fish out of water storyline but what a beautiful fish and such beautiful waters. A great study on cultural differentiation, sometimes highlighting what's wrong with the American psyche when viewed from a foreign lens. In short, they sometimes just overthink everything. Vive la différence! C'est la vie!"
620,The first time i see French actors speaking good English. I like it.
621,"This is my first drama 'cause I used to prefer movies - short (3 hrs max to get the whole story). But when I know this one was likely 30 mins each and there are 10 episodes only. I was like I am on.It is indeed a short drama and light - good for time killing in these days. We got enough heavy craps to handle in each day.The lines are clear and straightforward. Characters are cute and the clothes are nice. But then, because of all these, the story has nothing to do with reality. It is too nice to be true, so dont challenge the possibility and just enjoy the ideal life from it."
622,"I 💘 this new show, it's just so sweet to watch, and mood soothing to me, I was a Sex and the City regular and I have to say this one makes me feel the same way. The things they say about French people in this are kinda true, they can be really rude to tourists and sometimes Americans I have noticed this."
623,"Our lovely MC, Emily, is the bright & perky American in Paris. She hasn't bothered to learn the language prior to accepting her 1 year assignment abroad but is full of great ideas everyone but her Parisian boss love. The boss is a chic & successful older woman who is jaded and constantly annoyed by Emily in a Devil-Wears-Prada sort of way. The boss is having an affair with a married man and everyone seems to know it, but the affair is still treated with some discretion. It's presented as tho this is very common in France. I don't know if that's accurate, but the boss and her lover are an intriguing couple.Also in the office are 2 co-workers who start off stand-offish but quickly become Emily's allies. One is a gay man who is portrayed so stereotypically, it's painful to watch 😖.There is, of course, the fun & funny sidekick, Mindy, who instantly becomes Emily's bestie and happens to be available every time Emily needs her. I do like Mindy.Love triangle: Emily and her neighbor, Gabriel, share a mutual attraction, but Gabriel is in a serious relationship with Camille. Emily dates other guys, but of course none of them can compare to Camille's boyfriend. What makes this especially annoying is that Camille is a decent person until the last couple of episodes where it feels like she suddenly becomes a money-obsessed snob for the purpose of justifying Emily and Gabriel as the better couple. 🙄I liked the cast well enough to finish the season. I had to remind myself this show is not intended to be meaningful or unique. That's fair; these kinds of shows have their place.The Net-Net: Fun for mindless entertainment"
624,"I found this not a too bad series and a good break from the covid reality. In all it is a bit silly and I read somewhere that the folks in France hate it. I can sort of see why as all the people depicted as French are very stereotyped. The down side is that all of the episodes, so far (I am on 7) are exactly the same. She goes to work gets in trouble and wins in the end. But a good watch."
