0,"AND after the opening episode, even with the unexpected fantasy ending! I was hooked & raving about it to anyone who would listen.....So what happened after the initial 10 I gave it? Well for me it jus lost it's way & tried to cover toooo many subplots with a good handful along PC lines which I didnt think really fitted with the main theme, which was racism in 50's America in a fantasy setting . If they had stuck to those main 2 themes I think they had a real winner here but it morphed off into 20mins sub plots with no real part in the story eg his gay dad's escapades in the middle of an episode?? relevance?? NONE!After the initial opening, which alone is worth the watch it stayed strong before disappearing up its own ar$e at times in the middle before a great tale set in Korea which again you could watch as a standalone, before again we descended into a bit of a mis-mash.So much promise but in the end sadly didn't really deliver as it tried to cover too many (irrelevant) bases along the way."
1,"I can't believe I felt the need to write another review because I see users leaving reviews NOT KNOWING THIS IS BASED OFF A NOVEL from 2016 by author Matt Ruff. I shouldn't have to do this, but here we are. Please do your research on the novel before watching this show. If you can read this or leave a review? You obviously could look this up much easier than writing an angry review because this is not based off something that it's not supposed to be. Know this going in or you're gonna be very confused and maybe even feel the need to come on here and voice your displeasure. Just want to throw that out. Now the acting, the camera work, the effects are all top notch. The story is pretty good so far (currently on episode 4). Also it is not a H. P. Lovecraft story. Mmkay?"
2,"Pros:
The music/soundtrack for the film is fantastic. I love how they incorporated old recordings of civil rights leaders into the soundtrack. Very effective.The acting is really good for the most part.The production design and cinematography are pretty great.Cons:
The show is a mess. Tries to do too many things. It's clunky, and deeply corny at times.Far too much exposition. The writing is incredibly trite. It has an air of self-importance that the writing and directing never quite live up to.The CGI is very amateur.Overall, Lovecraft was deeply disappointing. It was incredibly obvious and beats you over the head with its message. It tries to incorporate far too many sci-fi/fantasy/horror elements. The whole thing is a disappointing mess. I'm not sure how the script made it past the development stage."
3,Creative history lesson whose fantasy ultimately got so absurd that it was unwatchable :-(
4,"I have watched currently 7 episodes, as they are the ones out at the time of writing this review.The first two episode set up the world and characters amazingly, you can't wait to continue watching. These episodes are a solid 8/10 in my opinion.The problem is that after each episode starts to feel like filler episodes. They keep introducing new characters to whom we should care and making vague connection to the main characters.This is like The Walking Dead started with Season 6 immediately.Not recommended."
5,"I was really impressed with the first two episodes, the third episode turned a bit strange, while the fourth and fifth have just sent it off the rails.
I'm a big Michael Kenneth Williams fan so I figured it'd be a great series, and there's nothing wrong at all with the acting or the actors, it's just not making sense.
I'm really disappointed because the story is getting hard to follow, it seems like it just took off on a completely unrelated tangent away from the science fiction and historical baseline that was established at the beginning. It holds true to the times of the 1950's, the racial injustice, etc., but beyond that it just seems to be kind of aimless.
I really don't know what to say beyond the fact that I'm disappointed."
6,Wanted to like it. First episode was really good and so was the second and third one but after that it pretty much went downhill.. too much going one and not finishing a story before it starts a new one. Too bad. The beginning it had so much potential
7,"I'm baffled by the high reviews for this. I love sci-fi and horror and all the kooky stories out there, but this was even too much for me. There is so much going on and it doesn't follow any clear path. The description of ""man looking for his father"" is so misleading. It's illuminati, mutants, magic, racism, vampires, monsters, ghosts, and even more. But it's so much that you just can't keep up! By the time I got to episode 5 I realized I didn't give a crap about any of the characters. None of them form a connection with the viewers. I was so disappointed."
8,"As usual with IMDB we have a bunch of idiots scoring a piece of entertainment either from their political viewpoint or just plain stupidity.The 10/10 reviews are completely over the top, overcompensating for the other extreme reviews or championing a show because it aligns with their side of the political divide splitting the western world just now.The low reviews are pushback on the irritating, delirious and frankly lunatic woke internet - or idiots turning up expecting a Lovecraft adaptation, then spitting the dummy out because it's not what they were expecting.To filter out the noise and find a middle ground somewhere in the reviews is not easy, so let me help you out with an objective summary of the show;Updated upon finishing season 1:The bottom line is, this is a badly written show. It's a mess. Lacks cohesion, structure, quite often any sort of plot and the characters are underdeveloped and become hard to care for because the is very little in the way of consistent internal logic.However can be fun B movie horror-lite escapism. It has a bunch of brilliant actors, exploring various horror tropes through the eyes of a group of characters played as best they can be, because actors embody the roles so perfectly, even if the writing serves them poorly.
If you like b movie horror you'll enjoy this as the production values are high.The period setting, sets, locations, probs, the hair & make up and wardrobe are all of an incredible and authentic feeling standard.A major issue with the show is the CGI. CGI in horror rarely works well and this is a particularly poor example. The show would have been much better served hiring practical effects people.If you are going to come on here and claim you did not feel this suspense in the first episode in the sundown towns, or the raw emotion of episode two, then you are either a liar......or you are just a dick. There's no getting away from that, so get a grip. However subsequent episodes cause the show to lose its way as the politics completely take over and the show gets heavy handed and stupid. It starts off dealing with racism, which is what we expect coming in but then branches out to gender and sexuality and before we know it you feel like you are suffocating in politics. Stuff I happen to agree 100% but I don't need constantly hammered over the head with it. Give us break ffs.Pre internet, pre woke social media we would have been able to enjoy a show like this for what it is, with no agendas attached.Sadly escapism really doesn't exist any more, between snowflakes wanting to cancel everything, politics infiltrating almost all sources of entertainment and the right wing reaction to them. It's very difficult to get an objective review anywhere.The vitriol aimed at the show is ridiculous. The 10/10s are equally as eye roll inducing."
9,"They just took a bunch of ideas and threw them into a blender. There is no coherence to anything in these episodes. They're hard to get through. I painfully got through the first two episodes and that was that. The ""Moving on up"" scene was dreadful, among others. I don't know what will happen to the characters but I couldn't care less. They were just cardboard cutouts you don't care about and since the ""story"" is all over the place, I can't figure out why anyone else does. This thing has a lot of 10 star reviews and I'm wondering if they even saw the same thing I did or they think they look smart by giving this poorly written drivel ten stars.The racism in the south in the early 50s was done well and the actors are all talented people. This is the only reason why I gave it 2 stars. Sadly these people are stuck in a terrible show. I wonder if they know it?"
10,"This series is a mess. It's never clear what exactly the message is. Is it about racism? All of the characters practice it. ALL white people are bad, but not all black people are good, especially the ones who betray their families for their white lovers. History? The actual history that is mentioned never relates to the plot. Gay people are made evil. Magic is desirable, especially if you can use it to hurt people. I watched every episode, some of them twice, trying to figure out what exactly was going on. What was I supposed to learn? I have no idea. And what were those monsters in the woods? Never explained. I wasted my time, but I can say I saw it. Knowing the state of awards now, this will probably walk away with all of them and I'll still ask why."
11,"This show is based on Matt Ruff's novel. Not on any of the original Lovecraft works. The people who are complaining about propaganda, liberal media, or bla bla bla are idiots. The TV-show is following the source material fairly well. They didn't choose the title just to cash in on the Lovecraft name, they choose this work because they clearly liked the source.However! The novel is so loosely connected to the Lovecraft's original work, that it's almost insulting. The novel is really bad and the show is doing absolutely nothing to improve upon it.I really feel like I'm watching two completely different things here.
On one hand it's a really well-crafted story about racism in the south during the Jim Crow era. On the other hand it's a horrible bad attempt at horror.The acting is really solid. The story is well-developed, but the characters are so flat and predictable. Both the antagonists and the protagonists are boring stereotypes. The side-characters are almost parodying. They are an exaggerated imitation that fails to be humorously. The only character that seems to have some flesh on his bones are Atticus.The dialogue is really well-written. But, The pacing of the script is terrible. It feels like I'm watching a 50 minute intro to a 2 minute movie.The soundtrack is just all over the place. I appreciate BB King everyday of the week, but when it's inter-cut with some unflinchingly generic hiphop it just hurts my ears. The intro is suppose to show a scene from Korea, but has music form the 20's. The show takes place during the Korea war (that ended in '53), but 'you upset me baby' wasn't released until 1957.The CGI is awful. Really really bad 2001-ish quality CGI. This is an HBO-show. Why does it look like a LOTR rip-off from some b-rate studio VHS tape?And it's just all these small details that constantly shakes you out of immersion with the show. Every time you relaxed and start to get dragged into it, you get jolted back into your own living room by the fact that you are watching a screen-play of a amateur novel."
12,"After 4 episodes I can't watch anymore, I get racism was prevalent but every white character is just an angry shell which not an inch of character. I was anticipating this show so much but it's just not that good, acting is fine but it's not scary and to be honest, it's quite boring. Hoped for a lot more!!!!"
13,I have not had a show relate so much to my inner nerd and suspense. This is an excellent show which gives factual Black history.
14,The artificially depressed rating of this show is shameful. Every technical element in this pilot episode is a 9/10 or higher. The script could be tighter. 7/10. Acting is superb. 8/10. Overall 8/10 and I cant wait to watch episode 2.
15,"Wow.Just wow.Two episodes in, and this feels like someone went and threw random concepts into a mixer, and poured out a mess, and called it a script.
After HBO spent a ton of money on it, it does look gorgeous.
But the plot is like something that the current MARVEL comics churned out: somebody who apparently tried to read some horror once (and got bored a few chapters in) wrote a weak fanfic that relies on invoking white/male guilt, because it literally has nothing else to show.
There's no setting, no plot line, the protagonists are cardboard cutouts, the supporting staff is somehow even worse, and NOTHING has weight or consequences, because hey, MAGIC!
If you're looking for even a hint of Lovecraft here, then better steer clear."
16,"I love how this show stretches the pages of LoveCraft Country to the end of our imagination. I love the way it's shot down to the film that's used. Everyone has that kit from within glow. I love how complex the characters are, how everyone has their own time to shine. I haven't looked forward to Sunday nights at 9pm since Underground. I really hope that there are a few more seasons inside these brilliant writers!"
17,"Great cast, scenery, music, cinematography and intriguing acting! I've been anticipating this show awhile even before there was a trailer with the creators/ producers involved plus I binged Underground by Misha Green a couple months ago. Not sure why Lovecraft Country already has a 5.7 definitely deserves better! From the trailers I can imagine the rest is exhilaratingly unique and has so much potential."
18,I love this show. Intense. Scary. Thoughtful. Harrowing. It's the one show I can't binge watch. Each episode is like a movie. I need time to decompress and think about what I have seen. I love it. More shows like this please.
19,"The pacing from the first to the second episode was incredibly inconsistent. The first episode was enjoyable enough and showed great imagery of racism prior to the Civil Rights.The second episode though - my god was that bad. Weird jumps between scenes, it didn't take time to develop the setting, characters, or do horror in any meaningful way. With this being commentary on Lovecraft, I would have thought there'd be horror, and not just vague illusions to tropes like cults or monsters. This was more of a middle grade dark fantasy story. Looking at the novel, this story was only a hundred pages long, and the HBO adaptation didn't add anything to it - so that is about the length of a middle grade novel. Adult horror is usually longer and better developed. With Jordan Peele involved as a producer, I'm really surprised by the low quality."
20,"This is my first review on IMDB.
For years I have been coming here for reviews on movies and shows, as a way to pick the good from the bad. Sometimes I agreed with the reviews, other times...not so much.
There were some pretty high rated movies I thought were stinkers. No problem, de gustibus non est disputandum. But 7.3 for this? No. No, no, no!
Let's start with the good stuff: Afro-American perspective. It's genuinely refreshing to see some more of PoC actors and culture in movies and shows. That, and Get Out (Us is even more ridiculous than this show), are the only good effects from Jordan Peele's directing/producing career so far. I'm starting to think he should return to comedy, Key&Peele are crazy good.
Acting is pretty decent, too. As good as it gets with this horror of a script, I suppose.Bad stuff? Almost everything else.
Story is beyond ridiculous (with episode 2 as a pinnacle of nonsense). No amount of suspension of disbelief would make me swallow this rollercoaster of absurdity. Maybe with a huge amount of LSD on the side it could appear somewhat plausable. Supernatural is a super serious show compared to this.Writing is downright horrible. My intelligence hasn't been this insulted since Prometheus. In 4th episode they drive a good bunch of hours to Boston to find the secret vault, than they walk for a couple of hours and BOOM!, they are back in Chicago! This kind of writing is beyond lazy, it's downright insulting.
Plotholes are bigger than the plot itself. Characters are awfully written, not just in sense they are basically cardboard cut-outs but they are often mean to one another (especially protagonists) without any apparent reason, just because.
Whoever made the soundtrack needs to find a different job. There are some beautiful soul, R&B and jazz songs in the show, fitting to both the era in which show takes place and the setting. Those are cut with some mumble rap and house. Oh, and Marylin Manson. Whose music I like, but fits in here like gangsta rap fits in Pride&Prejudice.Also, Mr. Peele, if you're reading this: hammering ""white people bad"" into every other scene or piece of dialogue isn't the most effective way to get across the message of racial tension in USA today and inequality that the African-Americans have suffered for centuries, and suffer still. Movies like The Help or Green Book should help you learn how those issues can be addressed with high quality.P.S. I know show is not intended to have anything to do with Lovecraft, but I would sure love more Lovecraft in it. This didn't affect the rating, just saying."
21,"The biggest question I had about the show was how much of the horror themes were gonna be racial or Lovecraftian. As of episode three, the horror is fairly evenly balanced. There are a lot of scenes that focus on racial tensions and horrors that are extremely well done, and never feels like a slap-in-the-face message about racism. Rather they produce genuine tension and anxiety. As for the Lovecraftian horror themes, they are fairly sparse and scattered (nothing really happens until the end of episode one), but when they do show up, they are exquisitely well done and interesting. There are constant nods to Lovecraft, and his mythos- i.e. episode three is a love letter to ""The Rats in The Walls""- and the story incorporates and weaves them in well so far, but it is only episode three. Now for why it may not be for everyone; it does have a complex story and method of delivery. A lot of information is alluded to, or glazed over so you really have to pay attention, and episode two was very confusing on the first watch and required two watches, paying close attention each time. It is not the show for you if you are looking for an easy story to digest, this one will make you think and put things together yourself. On the other hand, if you don't mind using your brain when watching this show, it's superb, especially for those who love and are familiar with Lovecraft and his mythos. The overall direction of the show is still a little unclear. It started out with a clear motive but switches up really quick. That is one thing I am still waiting to see is the overall story arc and direction. As I said though, it is only episode three of supposedly ten so far. I would highly recommend watching if anything mentioned about it sounds interesting."
22,"This show is amazing- each episode is excellent horror, touches on powerful history, includes three dimensional characters, and challenges the viewer."
23,"Lovecraft Country got rave reviews (based on the first five episodes) in the press where I live so was fairly excited about this show - even though I rarely trust professional reviewers. And, oh boy, was this a reminder of why.The acting is good and the characters are likeable. Albeit quite one dimensional. I'm getting pretty damn bored with the american fixation on parental issues as a drama engine and Lovecraft Country proves to be no exception.The camerawork is good, the scenery is splendid and the portrayal of South Side Chicago in the late 50's feels very authentic - until the immersion is torn away by the directors decision to use modern hip hop as a musical backdrop in one of the scenes. Like, why? What does that achieve?I'm aware that the name of the show is taken from a modern novel and that's also the only connection to H.P Lovecraft. As horror it is the exact opposite of his style. No atmosphere, no feeling of dread, wonder and mystery - just straight up cookie cutter monsters in a forest that appeared out of thin air after two minutes of building suspense. Not impressed.I can only hope the show gets better but I'm doubtful."
24,"I haven't been this excited since the first episode of Watchmen. Not sure where to start, the colors, the acting, the wardrobe, the writing, the directing! A fantastic and absolutely thrilling episode that leave you wanting more of everything. Everyone who was a part of this production should be so proud of this beautiful show they have made. I am so looking forward to the rest of the season!"
25,"Oh boy. 1st episode seemed okay but wow 2nd episode just nose dived so hard that it may have very well ruined the entire show for me. And the preview for the 3rd episode looks even worse.Folks, I'm afraid I'm going to be bowing out early here. I'll give 3rd episode a whirl and if it's not something at least good I'm going to call it a wrap on this show.Some shows have slow first episodes. Some times even slow 2nd episodes. This went from a so-so first to almost worst I've ever seen from HBO in the 2nd.Whatdafunk HBO......... seriously"
26,"It doesn't have anything to do with Lovecraft
It is political in every second
Says something about racism every 5 minutes
The special effects are bad
All white characters are villains. I wonder how the media would react if people of color would be villains in every episode of a show"
27,"Started off OK and then quite steadily going downhill. The casts are very annoying, male lead the most. There is no chemistry between them and it is just getting very boring."
28,Bailed on this trash pretty quick. May be the worst streaming series ever.
29,I'd rather watch someone run in a circle for an hour.
30,U will get political messages shoved at u every 5 minutes .
31,"I did not read the novel. A good movie or TV series is often better off when you don't read the source material. In this case I'll never know how good the book may be since ""Lovecraft Country"" went from promising to so bad in just five episodes that I won't be re-visiting this country any time soon. The series has some great actors and had an engaging start. Yet, when it started to get in to an overly complex secret brotherhood storyline a la ""The Da Vinci Code"", a lot of gratuitous violence mixed with a soap opera of entangled characters a la ""Game of Thrones"" and then threw in a combination ""Pirates of the Caribbean""/""Indian Jones"" underground cave/ride sequence, well it went from engaging to preposterous to ludicrous. Then, with the wokeness being shoved down your throat instead of being integral to the story, well I can get preach to at church and not from HBO MAX. ""Lovecraft Country"" is trying too hard - and failing."
32,"Anyone have a clue what it's about? Kind of an disjointed mess. Too bad, as clearly lots of expense went into it, and it has good actors. Was ready to quit into ep 3, finally watched all 10 via dvr (maybe out of curiosity). Yes, racism Is a very bad thing, but that's something (hopefully) most of us really know, already. A series also needs a comprehensible a story and writing, with some sense of dramatic flow."
33,"Please, no more. This is terrible. A very badly written show. I am aghast that this trash got aired."
34,"That's it. That's my review.Nope, IMDB says ""sorry your review is too short."" OKAY. Let me elaborate. The CGI is laughable. There's literally Zero Lovecraft-feel to it; to ANY of it. The whole thing seems rushed. Found myself wondering, if production was pushed through, due to covid. It's just not that good, not that good at all. To the point that, well, it's like something you would see on Syfy. Maybe that works for some folks, but not me. Couldn't have been looking forward to it anymore than I was. And I didn't make it out of episode 3. The monsters are pathetic. LEGITIMATELY PATHETIC! The setting is historically inaccurate. The direction is probably the best part of the show, but even that is disappointing.I bailed on this show like Christian. And couldn't be happier. Watch Color Out of Space, if you're looking for something truly special...on the Lovecraft front."
35,"What a mess this is. The actors do their best with what they are given but even they can't help this gigantic turd. There are brief moments of creativity but that creativity takes things beyond any semblance of coherence. If you have tons to waste by all means use it for that. If not, pass it up."
36,"At the beginning it was ok but after third or maybe forth it became to a kids show.
As I said do yourself a favor and watch something else."
37,"An incomprehensible, scrappy and utterly ludicrous series that drags so much each hour feels like three. Awful."
38,"Man I'm a huge fan of Lovecraft's work. I've read a lot of what he has written and when I heard that a show called ""Lovecraft Country"" was being made I was super hyped. Then the trailer came out. It looked AMAZING. The trailer is also completely and entirely misleading. This show isn't based on Lovecraft's work AT ALL. It's based on a 2016 novel by Matt Ruff. This show follows a black man who goes around the country searching for his father. The scenes you see in videos where there's any mystery... That mystery is not related to Lovecraft's beautiful monstrous creations at all. It's all propaganda to make you watch this nonsense show.In the first four minutes of the first episode I was greeted by the most ridiculously over-the-top scene that I could possibly have imagined, immediately lowering my expectations of the show. And it just never got better. It's uninteresting, uninspired, tries to be topical, doesn't even attempt to be Lovecraftian. You'd have to do something very wrong to get me not to watch a show with Lovecraft in its name and somehow HBO did it. Wow. In just two episodes I'm utterly disgusted by this trash."
39,"Lovecraftian horror is not about quoting Lovecraft's lore and then showing straight into your face some generic monsters eating people. It's about atmosphere. Sadly there's nothing of that here. The only element slightly worthy of the title was the ongoing investigation that the protagonist were following. It all crumbled at the end of the episode, it went full hollywood horror boring fest. No brains, no suspense, no cosmic horror. No atmosphere.Can't say I'm surprised. Shows and movies keep quoting Lovecraft but they often miss the mark. For a good reference the writers should watch Alien and The Thing."
40,"The combination of muffled, mumbled dialogue, an incoherent plot, and over the top CGI, basically made episode 2 unwatchable. As for episode 1, the Midwest and the Northeast that the three main Black characters drive through from Chicago to near Boston in the 1950's appear more like the Deep South of the 1930's. There were no ""Sundown Towns"" in Massachusetts or any Northern state in the 1950's!"
41,"I'm a fan of the Lovecraftian universe, theme and all that. I wanted to like this series, despite the red flags that were all over episode one. And it just got worse and worse as it progressed forward. It feels like someone had a good idea, wrote half of the script of episode one, then left, and now they're just picking some random guys to write some parts of each of the episodes. It's really dreadful.By episode 5 it has gone to the point that the Lovecraftian story line is about 25% present in the movie, and there's zero to no progression throughout the whole episode in that. But you get everything else, unfortunately, and this is the part that I don't like to be honest. Why did they have to turn this series into a speaking-tube of Hollywood? By episode 5 you get everything you need, rude, blatantly discriminating white people, minorities taking revenge, non-heterosexual people being introduced and portrayed in a VERY sexualized manner, which has literally 0 connection to the story line so far. What good or justice does this do to anyone, be them minorities or not? As most of the characters are displayed in a very one-dimensional and derogatory manner. What's the point of all this? I don't get it really. It's just sad.If this would've been only one thing, I maybe would've let it slide. But the lazy writing is just so blatantly obvious. Almost all of the scenes which have tension, end either in a very straightforward and anti-climactic way, or we just cut to the next scene (usually tomorrow), seeing the character shortly, without any clue how the previous scene got resolved. It just did, I guess, I should get over it. To me this feels like the writers think that it's a bunch of dumb people watching it, who either won't notice or don't care, which is insulting to say the least.All in all I feel that it's an insult that this series claims any connection with the Lovecraftian universe.I'm disappointed."
42,"Well, be warned - the show has nothing to do with Lovecraft's cosmos. Lovecraft Country belongs rather to the line of those new shows a la Carnival Row with the rather blunt ""technique"" of black and white painting of the characters.
On top, at time writing this few lines, 50% of around 4k of ratings are a straight 10 - I guess, this is a heavy indicator for a boost by producers, production company etc.
Anyway, if you like to watch another show around the theme racism and race embedded in horror/fantasy show you may like it. Acting and production are okay. But I don't see myself investing more time into Lovecraft Country - but I expected something different, because I had no clue what the show was about and the name Lovecraft lured me into it. My real rate would be a 4, but i subtracted one point for this ""click baiting"" with using the name of the great maestro of cosmic angst and terror."
43,"As a huge horror series fan I'm confused, this thing is so far, horrible, why is everyone saying it's not? What's going on?"
44,"First 3 episodes are fine, but the rest are just plain boring. Basically it's a Supernatural wannabe with HEAVY RACISM issue. I lasted 9 episodes, but stop watching in the middle of the 10th episode. Yes, that's how boring it is."
45,"Bad, bad writing. This is yet another example of writers thinking they are better than they actually are. It seems people get rewarded for writing complete rubish, and thats just the way it is. Not surprised anymore that such dribble get produced and praised."
46,"I enjoyed the cast of characters along with the blending of black cultural and intellectual history, particularly with the use of James Baldwin. Certainly, pays homage to the Sci-Fi and Horror of the period of the show as well as the lore of the shows namesake. Journee Smollet is the real MVP. A Beautiful shot, directed, and acted series so far. I can't wait to see more episodes of the series."
47,"Lovecraft? Really? The old ones? Really? Where?The only monsters I've seen on this show are the white people. I feel like HBO took everything they could find that was harsh and cruel about 1950's black living and crammed it into the first episode, jacked up everything wrong about this time - 65 years ago - and then called it Lovecraft County? Why?Well filmed, well set, good actors... but no Cthulhu or the Great Dreamer or Yog-Sothoth? Just a cracker sherif and a lot of mean, scowling white people.One thing that surprised me was casting Jurnee Smollet, sister of Jussie Smollett, as the girl in the trio of ""blacks looking for answers"" as Jurnee looks white. Are they making a statement?"
48,"So what is it?It is watchable modern horror, but nothing amazing. Nothing extravagant.It is a bit heavy considering current BLM environment and one may cast views on how it portrays white people, but ignoring those vibes, Lovecraft Country quickly turns into a monster fest which is not what Lovecraft horror is about.Lovecraft is subtle, elegant and slow suspense. This? It's quick, fast and there's no suspense.Only element of Lovecraft this show has, is in its name."
49,"Except its racist nonsense, shame as it had a few really good actors in it.Its like an 8 year old got asked to write about 1950s America."
50,"Episode 1 built suspense and left the horror elements until the climax.Episode 2 built nothing, did nothing and made me cringe.The one element running through so far is WHITE MAN BAD."
51,"I've been trying to come up with what I thought of it since watching it.It's a Sutter Cain story.In the Mouth of Madness, was a Lovecraft homage movie from John Carpenter centering around a clap trap horror writer named Sutter Cain. Now not to spoil the plot there because I suggest you watch it, but this show is like what a Sutter Cain novel is professed to be in that movie.The horror is kinda shallow in development, mostly shock value stuff. Kind of not so scary because it's a tad cheesy.Acting was OK, Johnathan Majors was most believable, most of the other actors seemed to oversell.It's not HP Lovecraft if that's what you're looking for. It's not really thinking horror (so far). To me that puts it in the solid average, it's certainly watchable, but like watching a budget paperback horror novel.Edit, as of Episode 4 it's kind of inconsistent. Parts of episodes will be good other parts will be bad. The opening half of the third episode was by far as good as this has gotten. Episode 2 was almost laughably terrible."
52,I see the ratings are a 5 point something and if you're Black you know why.. it's touching on a topic that some of these people rather ignore but also it's such an adventure and something so different! I look forward to the next 9 episodes! Please watch this show.
53,This is such a wonderful series. So much to unpack this episode. I haven't enjoyed a show that is unpredictable since the movie the Matrix. Where you don't know where it's going next. Yes. I know there's a book. But never read the book or knew it existed until.Each character has range. And their acting is superb
54,"I am a huge fan of Jordan Peele and the fact he was involved in this made me want to watch it, but, after two episodes I'm done. It's just the portrayal of almost every white character as an evil racist is just too much. All black people are good and all white people are bad and it's clumsy. Racism is abhorrent and there were people like those portrayed, but, not every white person was like that.
Such a shame really as the acting is really good, especially from the lead actors, but, it falls into the same trap as Marvel's Black Panther, thinking that making a show or movie about black people should be enough, but, it's not."
55,What is going on? I'm either too smart for this show or too dumb. Episode 2 is one is the most horrific and ridiculous episodes of television I've ever seen.
56,"After watching episode one, there was hope. If they stuck to the theme of racism and inheritance and mysterious creatures....maybe they might uave a chance of survival, but they are trying to do too much at once in two episodes. That causes confusion and chaos and you will absolutely lose your core audiences. Like myself. They doin too much here. Stick to the three themes and run with that. Everything else about adam eve and space and aliens and etc is all garbage...."
57,"I'm no Lovecraft aficionado, but I do know how to spot a well told and paced story when I see one. Lovecraft Country was great. Halfway through the first episode I turned to my wife and said, ""Yeah, I like this one."" For me, that's rare. The story is exciting and scary, grounded in a reality that juxtaposes seamlessly with the fantastical elements of the show. So far every actor/actress has been top notch. Visually, Lovecraft Country is arresting. I could have been watching a big budget Hollywood blockbuster film. Everything about this was great from start to finish and I will be excitedly tuning in to further Sunday installments."
58,Using Lovecraft's name to garner attention and relevance.
59,It started off great and there are some moments but it's trying too hard. I lost interest about four episodes in. I did continue to the end but I will not go back next season. It could have been done much better.
60,"This series is best described as a well-intentioned mess. It aims for the stars but ends up in the mire. For example, it (unintentionally) trivialises racism with its caricatures, and cannot decide on its message (beyond Indiana Jones meets Monsterland).
Direction is patchy, from good to abysmal.
Overall, pretentious dross."
61,"I forget exactly when I realized that Lovecraft Country was not a great show. Perhaps it was when magic entered into the plot. Or maybe, it was when characters started straight-facing about ""The Book of names"" and chanting spells at each other. Or could it be when the writers trotted out subtle masterpieces of dialog such as, ""I didn't need money, whiteness is its own currency."" Ugh, what a shame. For although Lovecraft Country could have been great, it instead opted to be a cliched mess without a clear voice or message.Now that's not to say that Lovecraft Country is terrible. I would even venture that, if you go in with the right mindset, you can enjoy it. But I wanted Lovecraft Country to have some teeth, I wanted it to bring us an interesting perspective on race in America. Horror, especially Lovecraftian horror, seems like the perfect way to do that. For say what you will about Lovecraft as a person, the man created a unique style of horror that remains immensely effective to this day. His stories are usually slow burns with unknown dreads lurking in the shadows. Often the most horrifying bits are what you don't see. The potential parallels to racism in America are clear. By invoking Lovecraft's name, the show leads you to believe it's going to pull off a grand ol' coup by using Lovecraft's own style to show the horrors of racism. Racism that he very much practiced. Yet this potential is almost completely wasted.Simply put, Lovecraft Country show is not Lovecraftian. It borrows a few names and high level concepts from Lovecraft, but that's it. It's not even its own variety of pulp. If anything, Lovecraft Country reminds me more of a show you'd see on the CW.Which, again, fine! A bit of false advertising IMO but whatever. Yet even if you take Lovecraft Country as its own distinct work, it's just not great TV. The larger series plot is an absolute mess, the messaging is muddled, and the writing ranges from passable to laughably bad. It's a guilty pleasure type of show at best, sort of like True Blood was.Again though, it's not like I hated it. I liked the characters for instance, especially the core family group. A few podcasts and reviews I've heard also note that the show features characters who you don't often see on the screen. Such as having a Black girl who likes astronomy. Such as opening with a Black man reading a book. I mean God that's a depressing low bar for representation when you think about it, but the real sad part is that it's true! And while these characters suffer from some major writing issues, at least they are properly fleshed out and feel like unique humans in their own right. It's not revolutionary but a good step towards what normal should be.But oh man, let me tell you: these characters are saddled with some amazingly bad dialog! Characters often just state what they are feeling and why. Sometimes a character will straight up tell you what the writer wants you to take away from a scene, such as the whole, ""I don't need money ..."" bit. That line made me cringe so hard that I fell off my couch. Writing like this insults the audience's intelligence. Maybe some old white dudes need blunt message like this, but the rest of us would have been far better off with more showing and far less telling.And then there's the season plot. I'll be honest here: I had no clue why anyone was doing anything or what was going on a good deal of the time. Why do they need this magical book? Why is their family special? And why is there magic in the first place? I'm sure all the lore and details and whatever are documented on fan blogs, but I was really paying attention and I still didn't understand the plot or what was motivating the characters much of the time. At some point, I just stopped caring too.I really don't understand why the show decided to involve magic at all. Like not pseudo magic or symbolic magic, but literal Harry Potter style magic! They were clearly trying to make some meaningful comments on race and racism, so why throw some many downright silly elements around magic books and spells and whatnot? It's some major thematic whiplash to have Emmett Till's funeral going on in one scene and then to have someone talking about invulnerability spells in the next. At best this feels like what a bunch of executives would cook up while hamfisting a difficult topic. At worst, it feels exploitative to use real world historical events as the backdrop for stories involving monsters, spells, and time travel. It would take a very deft hand to pull something like that off well. Lovecraft Country is nowhere near up to the task.The poor writing, over reliance on melodrama and cliche, and some of the fan service around revenge, romance, and wish fulfillment would be easier to overlook if Lovecraft Country didn't try so hard to prove to viewers that is has big important messages. Yet even here, the show again falls into cliche and the sort of obvious takes that fit nicely into hashtags. The show never develops its own distinct voice. Lovecraft Country is a house of the racist horrors, but fails to capture the living horror that was, and is, racism in America. And unfortunately the fantasy elements of the plot deaden the impact the real life horrors the show tries to examine.As entertainment, Lovecraft Country is an ok guilty pleasure. Watch it for the characters and some of the fun action/adventure/horror bits. The larger season one plot is pretty garbage and you may find yourself chuckling at some of the unintentionally silly moments or cringing at some of its fumblings. Lovecraft Country just could have been so much better though. It should have been so much better."
62,"I really wanted to like this series, but I found myself getting really board around the halfway point. About half the episodes are exposition, though interesting, don't really add much to the story. Because of every other episode being an exposition episode, it makes the story extremely convoluted and somewhat hard to follow. It feels like they attempting a pop cereal theme but they lost the narrative structure as an unattended consequence. Another issue is that the use of racial injustice is so heavy handed that all characters boil down to only being traumatized victims or foaming at the mouth racist monsters... there isn't much outside or in between. They could have made the villains more interesting with a bit more nuance or motivation, but the only real depth we are given is mindless racism cranked to 11 with 0 context. The main characters are so busy being victims of horrible racial injustice, we get very little character development outside of that. So overall, it's sort of a mess. I think if this series was cut in half, more nuanced with its characters and didn't shift gears on theme for each episode, it would be a lot more watchable"
63,"It has a few decent horror moments, the acting and characters are good...., but the convoluted story ... awful...with very little to do with lovecraft beyond the name, I was hoping for so much more as a fan of intelligent sophisticated horror.
First off , SPOILERS ->. cmon really a happy ending? WTF ? Ok the main character dies , but no one even ends up in an insane asylum , and time travel? What a mess. So Definitely not HP Lovecraft horror. It's more like a stupor hero genre film . I get the racial politics , and it's interesting to see that time in The American heartland portrayed irrespective of historic facts and unfortunately it's all in a rather extreme and unhinged way, absolutely no balance or attempt to show a deeper range of human behavior, basically it's very shallow. All whites are portrayed as bad, clueless or evil with nothing redeeming. The one Native American is slaughtered in a very graphic manner and with no logical explanation, that's the episode it really went off the rails . There was one interesting episode that takes place in Korea, but seems rather pointless to bring that character back, who is unknown to the rest of the heroic family for the epic final showdown, but by then its one hot mess anyway. If a modern show ever dared to be so extreme in its portrayal of blacks or Jews or Asians it would be condemned outright. but these days this type of thing has its defenders, and lots of HBO $$ behind it and It's a JJ Abrams production so I guess I shouldn't have been surprised by the crap story and reliance on CGI bling and lack of any logic."
64,"The first episode looked like it was developing a real story. Bit of a cliffhanger too. The second started off with the trio dancing around to the Jeffersons Movin' on Up theme song and really everything goes downhill fast. I got nearly to the end of the fourth episode, but the story and theme never got back to the calibre of the first episode. Off to a great start but don't expect that to continue."
65,"The actors and acting are amazing, kudos to the whole cast. The direction and visuals are also solid, the guy knows what he is doing. The way they melded hp lovecraft and exposed racism during the jim crow era was also on point. The overall story arches were just meandering and confusing as hell! There were way too many moments where I was thinking...well minus 2 minutes in one particular scene literally nothing in this episode had anything to do with what I watched last episode. I know this is based on a book that I'm assuming people like that, and this, which is fine. I enjoy a cohesive story so I'll skip a season 2 if there is one."
66,It started off a bit slow to introduce all the characters but by the end I wanted more. It's main cast is super interesting.
67,I can see where this is heading. It's great. Get over it petty people. It's unique and intelligent.
68,"Good looking actors and green countryside is the best part.
no content, one dimensional dialogues, bad people are all bad good people are all good, nothing else makes much sense or direction, strong horror of boredom."
69,This series is both supernatural and educational. There is an education my family needed to see within the entertainment. This country we love has some horrific acts in our history that are played out here while being intertwined with great story telling.
70,"First of all, let me just say that I've never heard of Lovecraft before, so wasn't really sure what to expect. To be fair, if I'd realised the genre of show I probably wouldn't have watched it. Apart from the weird sci-fi dream sequence at the beginning (which I thought was just that, a dream), I mistakenly assumed I was watching a series about segregation, repression and inequalities in America. It starts off okay. Set in 1950s America. Reasonably well acted and, whilst the portrayal of black and white segregation is not very subtle and a little unimaginative, I could still get into it. So, when monsters appeared about 3/4 of the way into the first episode, I was left wondering 'what happened there? Did I just switch over the channel by mistake?' After that I couldn't bring myself to watch much more. If the whole concept of monsters in a 50s style seemingly serious programme about segregation isn't enough to put you off, then the storyline and 'monsters' themselves probably will. Within about 2 minutes of encountering them, the main characters have already figured out how to keep them away. It lifts ideas from vampire, zombie and alien films and sort of mashes it all up into a new monster. Completely ridiculous. My own fault - next time I'll make sure I actually read the reviews/full synopsis, rather than just look at the headline rating on IMBD."
71,"This story could just as easily be told without sex. There is SO MUCH unnecessary sex! Hetero, Homo....the sex is explicit and rampant. What could have been appropriate for teenagers to view, turns into an unnecessary X-rated skin show. Lastly, a man is SODOMIZED with a 3 inch stiletto!!!!! Repeatedly! At least 5 times. The scenes of racism depicted in LC, are tame rated G compared to the sex scenes. I have found LC interesting up until Episode 5. After that, I will no longer be tuning in-I'll just read spoiler reviews on Monday morning."
72,"This show is so interesting to me, but I was so confused after watching the 1st 2 episodes! I gave the 3rd episode a shot & felt the acting was SUPERB, so it behooved me to tune in for episode 4 & I'm SO GLAD I DID!! Episode 4 gave me a lot of clarity on things I wasn't sure of initially. Things began to make sense to me & I picked up on a few things that have yet to be revealed (Christina/Will 1 in the same?? Idk??) yet it left me with waaay more questions now! Took my imagination in a whole different direction. I LOVE SHOWS THAT CHALLENGE ME & make me want to go back & rewatch earlier episodes."
73,"Very convoluted plot/script it's all over the place. Didn't make sense. I was watching and laughing thinking it looked like an 80's ghost buster or ""something"". And the music too all over the place and scary when nothing scary was going on. I'll give it a few more episodes but yeah with the consensus of the other reviews."
74,"I watched 3 episodes.
Kept waiting for it to improve; it never did.
I can't invest anymore time in this.
It's got all the subtlety of a community bedpan"
75,"Why is there modern music in a show set in the 1950's? This show is all over the place. Started out pretty good, then went completely off the rails. Couldn't finish it."
76,"If you hoped for a show that is slow and highly disappointing with the CGI watch this I guess. Nothing close to Lovecraft and should drop the name because at this point it's disrespecting it, it's so bad in my opinion. Plus just a note for everyone calling it sci-fi , it is supposed to be cosmic horror."
77,This is hurting me to watch i really want to like it im forcing myself to stay in this but honestly its just not very interesting at this point.
78,"As of writing, three episodes have been released.Episode one had me very interested. I liked all the characters, it was very tense and it left me curious as to the direction the story was going to go.Episode two ended up being pretty odd for me. It went in a direction which I truly didn't expect, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I still enjoyed it, but I let go of my expectation that the story would be Lovecraftian in nature.Episode three is great. There are some very spooky moments and the things which hooked me in Episode one (the characters, the tension, the strangeness) are still present. The ending of the episode was almost overwhelming in its weirdness and presentation.I still can't tell where the series is going to end up, but I like that. I don't find it predictable. I think if you go in expecting a traditional Lovecraft series about Cthulhu and elder gods then you'll be disappointed, but if you want a show about ordinary people getting caught up in paranormal happenings then you'll be happy enough."
79,"I got excited as this was apparently being advertised as an H.P. Lovecraft series. However, after painfully sitting through the first five episodes and wasting five hours of my life on this drivel I hope you don't make the same mistake."
80,"The second half of the first episode was somehow OK, but second and third episodes were just plain stupid. The very incoherent storytelling, stupid almost child like logic and forced narrative were insulting to the viewer. Dropping it. Not worth your time."
81,"This is simply one of the worst series I have ever watched. I enjoyed Riverdale better than this. The Pilot episode and the Korean episode was the only goo episodes. I don't why but I felt the performances were also poor eventhough they're all great actress. Maybe it's because of the poor story. Overall, I hated it (even the sex scenes) and I won't watch this if it gets renewed."
82,"First off, to all the people who say everyone should do a research, and should not be surprised this aint an H.P Lovecraftian show: frick off. Seriously. Why ever would anyone ever do research when seeking entertainment?! You like something, so you check it out. Of course people will be disappointed not to receive something they though they would WHEN IT HAS THAT IN THE NAME and the show's cover has strong suggestions aiming to Lovecraft?As for this so called show:
No structure, no story just random event piling on each other. The first few episodes were great, after that.. it went off the rail real fast.Nothing makes sense, everything is happening without a reason,in the end its unneccesarily gory.. This is a mess. A complete effing mess.
As for the setting: Racism is bad. No other ways around it, without anything to say really.
Huge disappointment, really."
83,"So, hmmm, did the Director or writers of this show ever read Lovecraft? What the hell is this is crap?I get it. I see how they are mixing things up from the normal Lovecraft stories, but this is nothing more than CGI with the Lovecraft name. I didn't enjoy much of the first episode which had about ten minutes of worthwhile moments. Then in the second episode, there were a bit less, except for the dinner scene which was very good.Maybe it gets better, but the first two episodes are lost to me. Yes, some individual good scenes, but everything else drags is either slow, absurd or inconsistent."
84,It's a esthetically enough to appeal to SciFi nerds like myself but it's poignant enough to gut check you into the ground.
85,"I am sooo late to the party with watching it but I love everything about LoveCraft Country. The messages, the history lessons, the supernatural elements, the clothing style, the characters!! Just wonderful!!!!!!"
86,"This show is fire , May we please have a season 2 and 3."
87,"The only people marking this down so far seem to be trolls or fans of the Lovecraft books. I'm just a lowly fan of good television which I find so hard to find.
If you've made it this far through reviews you'll know already the acting is amazing. I feel it tackles race and gender very well. Although a heavy theme (how could it not be?) it isn't heavy handed. A tool welded like a scalpel thay doesn't leave a scar on the story.
I don't find the characters stereotypical at all. The special effects are b movie only in the way Tarrantino movies are and I've never seen 1 review in the past write off Django because of the poor effects. Have you?
The show is heavily inspired by pulp science fiction and fantasy. If you don't like that kind of thing then please be my guest and go elsewhere. I'm not a huge fan but when it's brought to the mainstream well like Buffy, Kill joys and Blood drive then I can get on board. Like most of those shows there is a procedural element and a longer story thread. Mysteries come up and aren't dangled in front of you like most schlocky dramas and Sci fi.
Now one thing I do hate in TV and film... Tropes. They're pretty scarce. Even some tropes are brought up and disguarded straight away which is a relief. The will they won't they thing, the will anyone belive him about the monsters thing... I won't go on to stop any spoilers but I really could.
I can't help but feel anyone marking this down is not getting the pulp Sci fi vibe this show is intended for. I feel everything the creators have aimed to project from these stories so far land incredibly well."
88,Their is literally nothing related to Lovecraft. Their is no cosmic horror. Nothing but identity politics.
89,"I enjoyed the first episode even when it took a turn at the end! But couldn't watch the whole second episode, became too weird , and i was disinterested in the ridiculous storyline . But hey some people will enjoy it so ,to each his own, just my opinion at the end of the day!"
90,"This show suffers the same problem as 99.999% of everything made today : great actor, well produced, terrible writing. Long, drawn out scenes that lead nowehere, boring exposition that lasts way too long etc etc etc.I had trouble finishing the first episode."
91,"The slow burn that this could have been disappears in the first episode where you're already seeing monsters and magic. Where's the build up to the craziness? It makes no sense to set up the possibility of fantasy and then blow your load with it in the first episode.The second episode requires many leaps on logic at best and complete nonsense the rest of the time. I went in trying to separate my feelings from the excellent book, and lucky for me, it didn't matter.Jordan Peele and JJ Abrams have shown with Twilight Zone and the new Star Wars trilogy that they lack the ability build a coherent plot without relying on wild leaps in logic or leaning on crazy situations that hope to turn off the audience's brains.Truly lackluster and a real insult to the well thought out source material"
92,"Lovecraft Country is truly a time warp for the watcher, transporting you to the 50's. The time is reminiscent of Black migration, urban summers, block parties, and incessant and rampant racism.The wardrobe and accessories are fantastic for each and every character, down to the villians. The craft of acting is pehnomenal and paired with impeccable character development in the storyline.I've watched each episode 4 times and have been amazed by the Easter eggs, foreshadowing, and historical tidbits that entice the watcher to be a reader and research parallels between the storyline and real life horrors for Black and Indigenous people's across the centuries.Thos story is a necessary tale in so many ways. Using family dynamics, personal struggles and secrets to weave the lessons for a new century and decade in 2020.HBO picked a winner."
93,"Watched 5 episodes, hoping it could get any better.
It has no connection to Lovecraft's work.
That's just poor political propaganda."
94,"Episode 1 was good. Most bad horror still gets me to want to know the original version the writer intended it to be, but the horror in this series is so bad and apparently very well based on the original if I have to believe other reviews that I really don't want to read the book."
95,"Two episodes in, and this feels like someone went and threw random concepts into a mixer, and poured out a mess, and called it a script. After HBO spent a ton of money on it, it does look gorgeous. But the plot is like something that the current MARVEL comics churned out: somebody who apparently tried to read some horror once (and got bored a few chapters in) wrote a weak fanfic that relies on invoking white/male guilt, because it literally has nothing else to show. There's no setting, no plot line, the protagonists are cardboard cutouts, the supporting staff is somehow even worse, and NOTHING has weight or consequences, because hey, MAGIC!"
96,"I was really looking forward to this show, the first episode was good. The second episode was terrible, and the third episode is even worse.I don't think I can bring myself to watch another episode. I don't know why HBO thought this was good, this is such crap.Just a big jumbled mess that makes no sense."
97,"Oh man this is just corny. I thought the first episode was promising and I was intrigued by the story of the family/history of the big mansion. It's too bad they didn't keep the story focused there. I've just finished the 3rd episode and laughed at the ""horror"" scenes. They were so bad, like all the ridiculous B horror flicks out there. It's so silly and over-the-top that there's no way I can take it seriously. I'm really surprised. I don't think of HBO putting out cheesy shows like this. The only redeeming quality is the African American focal point. I won't be watching the 4th episode."
98,First pilot episode was very intriguing and full of thrill but now it's ep5 and I just can't believe what Jordan peele and Abrams did to this series. This series should be cancelled. The worst mystery thriller HBO has ever attempted. A flop show.
99,Finished the whole first season and it was disappointing. Needed more Lovecraft and less anti-white narrative. It's like the show wanted you to be more scared of white people than the creatures. The creators really went out of their way to screw up a great opportunity for a good show.
100,"Started promisingly but soon got quite lost and never really found itself again.
Struggled to keep my interest.
The character Abbey Lee Kershaw played seemed to be hamstrung by writers or directors.
Keep scrolling to the next show on your list"
101,"This is a blend of sci-fi, suspense, and horror, but lacking in all three genres. Often confusing, and packed with plotlines that lead nowhere, one winds up not really caring about the characters enough to even remember their names. I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Overall, it was all pointless with no emotional or intellectual payoff."
102,"Starts off interesting enough in the Jim Crowe south and tries to blend genres - racism, supernatural, vampires, time travel but I just couldn't follow the story and got lost along the way. The best part is the vampire fights in episode 1 and episode 7 but the rest of the episodes bored me and by the ending I had no clue what was going on. Maybe for those into these long winding twisty stories who have longer attention spans might be able to follow the story and enjoy it more. Still the first episode was decent. If they put more vampire monster fights I'm sure I would enjoy it more."
103,"As someone who has read the book, I wish they would have stuck more with the book. After the first few episodes it basically becomes completely different from the book and I'm not enjoying it as much."
104,"As a Lovecraftian fangirl this breaks my heart. This is everything Lovecraft would have loathed, cheap chintzy attempts at horror, no psychological horror or uncaring cosmos vibe to it in the slightest. Hollywood always do this, I'm surprised it's not by Netflix tbh they're the worst at pooping on the grave of the greats. All of Hollywoods writers combined couldn't compete with Lovecraft's worst story."
105,"This is the worst episode so far and by far. Disturbing, sad, senseless violence that adds nothing to the plot."
106,"This show is so bad I tried to watch it as a comedy, or B movie.
I was able to finish first episode, second episode was very difficult but third one is impossible, I stopped after 15 minutes.
I fully understand positive reviews, it is exactly same story as with new Star Trek shows.
And I fully understand this show will win many awards and will be described by journalist as best show ever."
107,"It looks like to me that these days the movie industry attracts more and more people who are maybe political activists and the like but really got not a drop of real artistic creativity in their blood. Lovecraft Country is another show/movie strangled by political correctness, wokeness or whatever term they use these days. One dimensional characters, a story written by some algorithm but not by a real talented writer. Production and actors doing okay. And last but not least, if you expect to meet Lovecraft, just take another road, you won't find him here."
108,Kept trying to like it. Just terrible. Storyline is so so so bad.
109,"As a lifelong fan of Lovecraft horror, I was very excited to see this announced. Where is the lovecraft? Way too much time spent on the racial inequality theme and not enough on the horror. It should've been either one or the other in which case they both would've been strong entertainment but it feels like they tried to breed a duck with a chicken. Confusing."
110,"A young African-American travels across the U.S. in the 1950s in search of his missing father???I watched the first episode, delighted to go back in time to witness an adventuring trio of friends/family across 1950's America. Coming across monsters and other mysteries along the way. And the atrocities of racism and how they dealt with that. But he found his father in the second episode! And now there's depictions of rape! Seriously, the shows description is misleading. I had such high hopes. If this review seems all over the place, don't worry, so is this show..."
111,The first episode starts out painfully slow...then get VERY weird. The show can't tell what it wants to be so it chose a little bit of everything. I'm giving it another shot but it's scattered for sure.
112,"Quite disappointed here. I was expecting something more like Penny Dreadful the original and I found something more like City of Angels...
Sorry but this is not Lovecraft or Cthulhu at all.I see good actors, some goods dialogues, but bad script, bad CGI and not Lovecraftiam atmosphere."
113,"I have been waiting for a show like this FOR A LONG TIME. It combines my favorite things, horror, sci-fi, and black people. Something like this has been needed for...forever.
First, we have the handsome, intelligent, observant Atticus ""Tic"" Freeman. A gentleman. Who seems to be searching for the truth of what exactly reality is.
Next, we have Letitia ""Leti"" Lewis. A firecracker who doesn't take s__t from anyone, not even a bigoted ghost who haunts her new home. She shatters stereotypes with every breath.
Then, there's Uncle George, played by the amazing Courtney Vance. Full of knowledge, this book lover holds all the clues the trio needs in the first two episodes to avoid a tragic ending.
Then Tic's dad, Montrose Freeman. A troubled man who I know has to be holding some deep secrets.That's just a few. There are so many other characters and stories I can't wait to see unfold.As a lover of horror and sci-fi, I only had to see the trailer one time before I knew I would be watching. Watch episodes again. You probably missed something the first time. Don't watch if you are sensitive about racial relations from the black point of view. Your opinion will be skewed and you will watch it with a closed mind. ""Whitey on the Moon"" is a piece about the US sending people to the moon while some of its citizens struggle. That's it. There is nothing anti-white about the show but I guess anything, where the ""majority"" isn't celebrated or praised, is anti-white. It's very obvious some of these low rated reviews are not giving this show the chance it deserves. That's unfortunate. This series has superb acting and a storyline that deserves a space.If you're looking for any homage to H. P. Lovecraft, who has been rumored to be racist, you will not find it here on this show.As with most pilots, the first episode my throw you for a loop. Not how it went for me but then again, I've been anxiously waiting for a show like this. The audio where most shows place music is always a perfect fit. Raphael Saadiq on the score.How can you not love this show?!Really?"
114,"One of the most boring, ovehyped TV turds I've seen in a long while. Painful to sit through. Badly acted, cast and directed.It is full of empty virtue signalling and meaningless wokeness, as if we don't already know the narrative and where it is heading...sigh... would it be too much to ask for a good show, with interesting characters and an equally interesting story?! I guess that would be too much to ask for these days...Give this show a wide berth... actually avoid like the plague! (pun intended)1 out of 10"
115,"I have truly not reviewed in awhile, but i had to for this tv show. For all the reviews that give this a 1/10; I guess we know who they voted for. lol. I assume they saw something about themselves in the first episode and started crying. This show is amazing. Yes the animation could have been tighter, but everything else makes up for that short coming. This can easily become a cult classic if advertised right."
116,"Great story, superb acting, highly recommend viewing! I'm so happy that HBO decided to pick up this show. It's refreshing to see something different and diverse. 🖤"
117,I know nothing about the writer or book. I found it beautiful. The main characters are so different and very interesting. It's imaginative.
118,"I'm a huge fan of fantasy and anything that dibbles in it. I was so elated when finally, we get to experience the fantasy but through African American eyes. Most shows and movies don't display weird happenings with the mystic arts and the mystical creature with African Americans as main characters. To be honest, the fact that the main characters are black were a plus. When I watch this series, the characters have character and not just putting black people out there as characters just to get other black people to watch, oh no, these were really well thought out characters and the icing on the cake were the actors. The way they pull you in, they make you feel like you're literally living this fantasy, you're engulfed. This show of course is for everyone to enjoy, no doubt but there's some relatability when it comes to actually seeing how it was and in some sorts still is on how it is to live life through brown skin. Plus, I love Chicago, a place where the most underdogs originate from in my opinion of course. I'm inspired because for once, this production touches on my weak spots, the spots that ache with pain, spots that runs my imagination wild, as well as spots that ignites my fire and makes me proud to live through my brown skin. Hats off to all who's involved in this production!👏👏👏👏"
119,"My first ever review ever because...Too many ridiculously low reviews just because peeps are ""real fans"" of lovecraft. For anyone who has never heard lovecraft country ( like myself and i love the sci-fi/horror genre that this is), then it's a great watch! Make your own mind up people. But I would recommend giving it at least 2-3 episodes"
120,"All was going well till e5, when things started rolling and not maiming any sense, as If jumping in time and missing out too many details. Ending was somehow stupid and didn't make sense !"
121,Just really couldn't take more than about one a half episodes of this. The premise is interesting and the series is well-done but it's just a bit too weird.
122,"I'm in the U.K. and watched episode 2 immediately after episode 1. What is going on with the sound? I can cope with the jump from one scene to another without continuity, but I can't deal with the dialogue under music under sound effects muddle. I need to hear the dialogue! The ""previously on Lovecraft"" run before episode 2 was crystal clear. Sort it out, please."
123,"I had high hopes for this series, but after two episodes, I am very unimpressed. This show is an example of an excellent premise executed poorly. It's almost as if it was made for the CW or something. Some of the actors are amateurish. The creature VFX is pretty laughable.I am a Jordan Peele fan when it comes to Get Out and Us. Those are well-written, well-acted, and tense films with high rewatchability. He did not direct this. He's a creator, sure, but did not have a hand in the directorial side of things, so reviewers should stop saying he directed episodes of this show.It took all of my strength to force my way through two episodes of Lovecraft Country. I won't be watching a third. Too bad. It could have been great."
124,"But after three episodes I've had enough. It started out well, the acting is solid, and the story is definitely interesting, so lots of promise. I would have given this series 7-8 based on the first episode, but it has been rapidly declining and I don't plan on watching it further. I admit I was hoping for Lovecraftian cosmic horror, but even as a generic horror/mystery this has been disappointing on multiple levels and a waste of a great cast."
125,"I tuned into this expecting something along the lines of American Horror Story, not Lovecraft - I knew this wasn't based on his works. Instead, this is a bit like Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter - there is a basic premise, but the story is all over the place so there is zero suspense. Loosely connected noise with some pseudo-intellectual banter. Had they focused on dialogue, it might have worked, had they spent some money on the CGI - which is cringe-worthy - it might have entertained. However, like most of the stuff with Jordan Peele attached, it's unbelievably lazy. Like, absolutely no effort at all. The actors do a fine job, but they're not given anything to work with."
126,"1st episode is just crap...there is nothing beyond black people mistreatement and there are better movies or series to watch for that stuff.
Story looks like a total joke, hope ep2 gets a lot better...."
127,"If you are already started with the show out of curiosity, dont get further than episode 4.
Worst show ever HBO. Another two shows like this and HBO stands for ( Historical Banana Office)."
128,"They do say you can't be disappointed if you don't expect anything and after what they did to ""colour out of space"" needless to say my hopes weren't high.This certainly seems to be the case for this series.First things first let's clear the fact this isn't a Lovecraft series.You expect a lovecraftian story to be well written, story driven and have the element of madness and despair taking over the protagonist like it usually happens in his written work.
The whole aim of the series is using Lovecrafts name to drag it down to the mud and project mr Peeles political agenda as it's usual the case with all his work.The problem with that is that there's no interest in creating an interesting story whatsoever.I could understand if there was some effort put into it but mr Peels moto is ""why work and do your job right when you can just promote your agenda?""If you are a Lovecraft fan and expect to see something lovecraftian,an interesting story or at the very least a story driven series to begin with then this is not your series."
129,"The first two episodes kept me interested and was entertaining. Now, I cannot even watch it. The gore is gratuitous. The storylines are trying to do too much. I want to watch good character driven dramas about members from the black community, but this is a gore driven political caricature wrapped in fictional magic cover of hogwash. I had to fast forward through half of the episode tonight because I couldn't watch it. I'm disappointed and done watching"
130,"I'm not a horror fan, I'm mostly peering at the scary scenes from between my fingers, but there is so much that is excellent about this show. As an examination of a genre it is both critical and loving. As a confrontation of a dark past that is the dark present it is harrowing and effective. It's also feels like a rush of fresh air into a stuffy room to see a show telling stories centered on and performed by people of color that HBO has positioned with so all the resources it needs. I believe that some reviewers are reacting to deliberate choices in pacing, complexity and narrative hooks or riffs that are deliberately cartoonish. I don't see this as accidental or a flaw, I think the show is playing a game with the audience."
131,"Was looking forward to seeing what this was about, and very impressed! I'm intrigued and ready for next week's episode NOW!!!"
132,"Sad to see! I had HIGH hopes..
Great cast superb acting cinematography awesome landscape fantastic.
Another, white man bad show!!
Enough of the race crap!! People want to escape this political garbage we live in all day these days.."
133,"The first episode was fine as a drama, but nothing to do with ""Lovecraft"" or crazy horror. I felt like they were trying to do something similar to the opening of Watchmen; there were perfect recreations of famous b&w photos by Gordon Parks and others centered around segregation, etc. An interesting idea, but it felt almost distracting for the first episode of a horror-themed TV show. However, I really liked Montrose and his business of ""safe"" trips for African-Americans through white America; this was a fantastic narrative device with great room for educational growth of the audience.By the end of that episode, it's as if they remembered, ""oh yeah, we need monsters or something"". The last few minutes seemed drastically forced and tacked on; but it gave us a cliff hanger to end on to insure we'll return to the next episode.The second episode was just weird, stupid, and kind not very interesting. Someone was trying to cram every trope of the recently fabricated genre of ""folk horror"" into this one for sure!! Yes, even a wicker man! Still, by the end of this episode, I felt zero atmosphere based on Lovecraft, nor any connection to the characters. Kinda just fell flat... I guess the monsters are there, but we find out they are controlled by the people in the castle; which means, they're not too scary after all.Curiously, I'll stick with this. I'm sort of interested in what happens. After that heavy historically dramatic first episode, I can't imagine anything will get that ""real"" in this story again. Honestly, I'm more curious to see if I can last more than 1 or 2 more episodes."
134,"Too much on the past that feels more like a history lesson than a storyline.It's also excruciatingly slow. First Episode didn't get interesting until last 15 minutes or less.The ""monsters"" are silly, verging on the Mucinex man. I'll pass."
135,Acting is excellent. Story is confusing but it's ore than enough to keep my interest. I'm really enjoying this show and I'm not exactly sure why! Very very engaging. I love the two leads and they make me hope it all turns out well for them. I love the music!
136,"So many inconsistencies in this. One minute they're in a racist hostile environment in 1950, the next morning the main character Atticus barges into a white community and walks angrily towards a white woman screaming at her and everyone around finds it normal and go about their business. Which is it? There's even a man giving a blowjob outside a bar. In 1950, Really? I know Hollywood has agendas but the odds of anyone walking in on something like that outdoors in the 50's would by those of winning the lottery. So why even bother if not to push an agenda? And why is the main actor playing Atticus overacts so much? He's always angry with a face like he's smelling something rotten all the time? He's definitely not the next Morgan Freeman.
I'm quitting this in the middle of the 2nd episode."
137,"I was really looking forward to this show. The name Lovecraft led me to believe it would be based on his works. Reading the reviews here, I see that it is based on a different book that was written loosely based on Lovecraft's stories. Okay, that's one step removed from the stories I expected. And, I hate sex scenes thrown in for shock value, as some here are. I want good stories, not sex scenes to move stories along. I'm not a prude, but I think the scenes in this series has no purpose but to shock. I fast forwarded through it, because it doesn't interest me. I've watched several episodes, hoping it would get better, it didn't. So, tonight I took it off my scheduled recordings and delete those I had already seen. I'm moving on, hoping to find some good series, with good, entertaining stories. This isn't it."
138,"The series tried tying together so many ideas in such a short period that it ended up being way too choppy. Every episode feels like its purpose is to highlight racial inequality during the time period, rather than delivering a coherent plot. It focused so much on race that it really hampered the enjoyability of the fantasy aspects."
139,"Like others already stated, its all over the place and it´s hard to actually care about any of the characters.
It´s watchable but only if there is nothing else on."
140,"I Just finished watching the first season. To summarize it: they had one of the most unique and the least utilized horrortheme at their disposal, which could had resulted an astonishing series with a honest attempt. But all that, utterly wasted and for what? So they just have to play modern rap music, because that does wonders to the immersion, which should be 1950s. Apply same approach with other modern themes throughout the 5 episodes and you get, Lovecraft Country."
141,"Amazing start! Then... quite the opposite, ive tried to carry on but can't bring myself to do so. Such a shame since the first episode was something else"
142,Excellently fleshed out show with plot that builds each episode. Historic references every episode meshed in with sci-fi thriller dramatic twists. Lovers of several genres will find something here. The costuming is to perfection. The characters are dynamic and complex. Rave reviews on social media match the fervor of the show. Each episode is action-packed and heart pounding and serves to tell an unexpected story embedded beneath the top story. Anyone saying otherwise is lying and has another agenda. This show is topnotch and well produced. It deserves the attention of a majority of viewers in modern society and will help to understand the perspective of the 1950s through the lens of a psychological thriller.
143,"I really wanted to like this show but in the end it was a huge disappoitment. It tried way too much to be social commentary while sacrifising character development, plot and suspense.Also alot of the social issues raised have already been done many times before and with alot more tension and realism. So it doesn't really add anything groundbreaking there, just imitation. But nowadays any social commentary automatically makes it great to some no matter if the commentary is actually done poorly.Then the biggest issue there's no build up and suspense at all with the monsters and they are really just an after though and thrown in there which is a shame.That said, the main actor is good and looks stunning and has elements of a great show. But in the end the story isn't there and no matter how they dress it up or how much sub-text there is its just average. 3 episodes in, I can't do it anymore I'm out."
144,"Hopefully the show gets better. I found it to be extremely dull. Tired of watching ""White people are the devil"" shows and movies.Smollett is a good actress, a lot more believable than her brother."
145,"Well, if you don't know Lovecraft, and also don't know American history or geography, this may appeal to you. Everyone says the same: first episode was good - in that it had the entertainment factor. But it fades fast in a bad way - like I imagine quicksand might feel like. it's not a show for educated people or fans of Lovecraft."
146,This is one of the dumbest tv shows I have ever seen. The clearly had no idea what sort of program to make. The tone skitters wildly from august Wilson to Raiders of the Lost Ark. this seems as if it should star Nic Cage. Truly awful and filled with characters who constantly do the dumbest possible thing. Each episode is worse than the one before. Utter garbage.
147,"Another movie/show that is borderline incompetent with regard to writing, storytelling and acting, but has a black cast, so it has to be rated highly. This is ridiculous! This is the most uneven, poorly written and acted high profile shows that I've seen in a long time. Nothing to do with race. Watchmen was genius. 1. Absolutely NOTHING to do with Lovecraft in the very least. NOTHING. If you say different, try cracking an actual book. 2. CharacterS do incredibly stupid things (especially the main girl) simply to advance the awful excuse for a plot that there is. 3. Graphic gay sex just to prove how modern and contemporary the show is. 4. Choppy and incompetent editing that seems to be forcing two hours of a show into an hour every episode. It's embarrassing. I'm guessing the studios hired a group of people to post positive reviews on October 5th. Come on. Really? This is maybe a 5 or 6 show for an average viewer. 10 for those with white guilt. It's a 2 for anyone that has a casual appreciation for competent storytelling. I haven't read the book, but if this is any indication of what it is like, no thank you. Like Jordan Peele's ""Us"", nobody seems to be allowed to give a negative review or they're considered racist."
148,"Jordan Peele seems to have taken a card from Ryan Murphy with this chaotic and confusing series, filled with 'Ooh I bet this would be neat' moments that fall flat. The premise of the show is decent, and it is what led me to want to see it from the very first preview. So far, it is nothing more than another quirky season of AHS that offers very little actual horror and a lot of chaos and reasons for Jonathan Majors to undress. There are some good moments throughout, but viewers must first endure some tired running around and soap opera 'Ooh look what they did now' moments. Episode One introduced us to the rich cultural world of music and dancing and livelihood and mystery - all of which seem lost when Episode Two rolls around. Of all of the cast, Wunmi Mosaku is the stand-out actor in this series. Her portrayal of Ruby is the most well-rounded and properly defined character to appear and to have a somewhat constant role. However, there's not enough of Ruby to make up for the scattered performances by Mr. Majors, Michael Kenneth Williams, and Jurnee Smollett - an actress I've always enjoyed but have trouble getting to know her character with her character's unbalanced personality. Jonathan Majors became a favorite of mine with his film 'The Last Black Man in San Francisco,' and I will remain a fan, but his character in 'Lovecraft Country' is so broken that it does not allow Mr. Majors to shine in the role. Instead, he takes a backseat to the ensuing rushes of plot twists, turns, and breaks that wreak havoc throughout. Mr. Peele, along with JJ Abrams and the rest of the massive production crew, throw a lot at us in each episode. In fact, we're given so much that it becomes hard for most of it to make any sense in the hour that each episode is given. Each episode ends on a cliffhanger of sorts. Those cliffhangers are, for the most part, abandoned once each new episode starts. Bits and pieces pop up here and there, but not enough for anyone to truly know what's happening, and after so much of this, I found I no longer cared what was happening. 'Lovecraft Country' still has a few episodes left in the season, and those are chances to turn this around. Yet, if the past couple of episodes are any indication, it will only get worse and more chaotic."
149,"I really liked the first episode, it was a great pilot. Very refreshing and I would recommend everyone to watch it. I don't know what happened after, but the show quickly after the first one because very boring and unoriginal. I think they might went too far with the racism as well. Not because of the white people, but because it makes the whole story and character actions very predictable and cliche. A part from the first one, this show was a letdown."
150,"Loved the actors and camera work, costumes, and scenes. Extremely disappointed by the story. Social problems - cartoonish and laughable, horror problems are trite and cartoonish as well. It's not Lovecraft, its' B rated movie horror. As far as ""racism"" portrayal, it was very bad in 50s, no reason to make it grotesque. It makes it a joke.
Never the less will watch other episodes, actors make you invested in the show. Cast is superb."
151,"I really wanted to see this series. Lovecraft name was the primary reason. But what it turned out was a mash-up of Social Justice messaging, pathetic CGI, laughable Indiana Jones copy, tired copy-pasted writing, series wide discontinuity and clearly the characters were not sure what emotion they need to portray. The protagonist was forever frowned, his father forever high-toned and all characters extremely foul mouthing. But what this series completely bypasses is horror. You will laugh at the so called horror scenes."
152,"Lovecraft Country started off strongly, and I had previously given it 9 out of 10 stars here for its cutting-edge insight into the everyday horrific racism so many people of color experience, and it also had some solid monsters and creepy vampires and witches. It seemed an altogether Lovecraft started off strongly, and I had previously given it 9 out of 10 stars here for its cutting-edge insight into the everyday horrific racism so many people of color experience, and it also had some solid monsters and creepy vampires and witches. It seemed an altogether wonderful series that combined pointed statements on the racism prevalent in America while also being truly scary, suspenseful, well acted, beautifully set, and burnished by impressive sets and creature computer graphics.
But.
Then Episode 5 happened.
Unfortunately for my dreams and emotional state, I watched the whole episode, which contains a rape scene so graphic that it made me physically ill. I had nightmares for two weeks and would probably still be having them if not for the fact that horrifying nightmares of a Trump win replaced them.
As a person who experienced sexual assault when I was a teenager, I believe very strongly that this series should contain very strong warnings that contain details specific enough to warn rape survivors that it will cause them trauma. This series just added another layer of trauma victims to that long and horrifying history of abuse in America. The story could have stood the same if they had cut the camera away from the scene and only suggested it, but the victim!s realistic and horrifying screams, combined with the monstrous zeal of the attacker, pushed the scene and the series into rape pornography, in my opinion. It also requires a discussion of the idea that revenge and retribution provide carte blanche permission for any sort of violence, as long as it is deserved and the victim ""has it coming."" I think Jordan Peale is a better writer than that. I stopped watching the series at episode 5, so here's hoping that the rest of the episodes are less horrific; I won't be watching. series that combined pointed statements on the racism prevalent in America while also being truly scary, suspenseful, well acted, beautifully set, and burnished by impressive sets and creature computer graphics.

153,"The genius of the show is to take common horror/fantasy themes, but place characters who have always been traditionally on the periphery of these stories, directly at the center. Well written and directed. Not perfect, but refreshing and necessary for all those unheard and uncelebrated perspectives and themes that reflect a more complete vision of US American culture."
154,"Great cast, storyline all ever the place lost me after 4 episodes very disappointed"
155,"There are so many interesting themes and it attempts so much. Stylistically it's cool and well produced. But the storytelling and characters are just all over the place. While the writing takes time and care to insert historically accurate tropes about race and obvious easter eggs for forgiving fans, so much of the time the actual storytelling is SO lazy. Which is just a huge shame, because the acting, production, and overall concept/intent are top notch. There's so much potential for a really incredible show! If only they could get it together and stop spending all of the time on cheap leaps to push the story forward and cheap hit-you-over-the-head payoffs. Even the melodrama moves in fits and starts. An incredibly frustrating experience. The show will most likely succeed in viewership on style alone, but I'm really hoping the storytelling improves and the heroes and villains become better written and more complex than just caricatures."
156,"So here we go. I was interested in watching this based off all the 10 star reviews.... let me pause for a minute to describe ""a 10 star review""A 10 star review means it's a perfect piece of entertainment on the movie screen. In my book there is probably only 15 films ever created deserving a 10 star review.So I click on these 10star reviews and notice 90% of them have only reviewed this one show.... nothing else. Folks this is what we call a bot account. They aren't real.And what is it with people giving either 1star or 10star reviews. Hello. Not everything you watch is the ultimate worst or best. Come on. We're not idiots here.So that being said. This 1 episode is all we have so far. So saying all of these reviews are premature is an understatement.From this one episode I'm intrigued. I'm also drenched in something that is starting to feel massively overplayed... racism. Racism is like the new sequels for Hollywood. Why? I don't really know. Some say agenda. Not sure. But it's obviously so overplayed it lets the air out every time i see it written into the story. -1 star for that. Come up with something fresh..... please.The acting is pretty good, but not great. Good enough to make it work easily. But no one is captivating in the least.It goes from weird, to funny, to sad, to dull, to gory, then to confusing etc. lots of turns. Hope the rest of the episodes get that ironed out which I'm pretty sure they will.The boring factor is why I'm act about a 5.5 right now. It just hasn't grabbed me. Yet anyway.
I'll update as the show goes on."
157,"The lovecraft name in the title got me to watch this ,along with some beautifully done visials in the trailer but the horror story is overwhelmed with the reality of the times its set in...The Real horror is in the people, their views , the predjudice and hatred...Its so strong in this story that it eclipses the gothic horror thats going on...With so much racial tension in the world today, I dont know why writers would choose to introduce This into what could have been an interesting storyline...the acting is good but not great ...The cinematography and effects are beautiful and capture the period and the gothic vibe.
I would much prefer the same story Minus the racial undertone and just keep it focused on the supernatural and the surreal, gothic aspect.... The recent watchmen HBO series also went with a heavy racial vibe that really
ruined that show for me....Maybe some people Like this but for me it detracts from what could be a cool story.."
158,"I really wanted to like this series, unfortunately very disappointed. It has slick production and good looking actors, unfortunately charactors are 2 dimensional, poor cgi effects, and poor attempts at humor. Everything is over the top and feels forced. Speeking of forced, going to try and get through the third episode"
159,"Cap 1 and 2
When the script is so incoherent and the editing so absurd, so much photography, production and performances are lost in nothingness.
Terrible.
PS: It's not based on Lovecraft, it's based on a novel by Matt Ruff.
They use monsters from Lovecraft and references like practicing cartoons.
I repeat.
Terrible.Edit added
Cap 3
Now the script is acceptable and allows you to enjoy and approve the excellent performances of the protagonists and the beautiful photografy"
160,"This is just another empty monster flick that predates on the name of Howard Philip Lovecraft. Cheap jump scares, atrocious CGI, mediocre acting, and nothing of the elegance and ominous narrative from the master of cosmic horror. Typical thrash from JJ Abrahams and another episode of the downhill trajectory of Jordan Peele, aka The New Shyamalan."
161,"I watched the 1 episode and go hooked. I'm pretty sure you will get hooked too. Thriller, Drama, Fantasy, Horror, and Mystery. What more can you ask for"
162,"I just had to jump in here after reading some of the other reviews. I watched this the other night and loved the first episode. Great to look at, interesting story. I was excited to move on to the next episode. What a mess.It was like it was written by someone else. It was horrible. So bad, in fact, that I am done with it. I know other reviewers say it gets better again but I don't care. You can't make something this bad and expect me to trust you are going to pull out something worth watching. If I went out for dinner and the appetizers were great but the dinner sucked, I wouldn't be sticking around for desert. I would leave and I am leaving Lovecraft Country."
163,"Was thrilled to see a big-budget HBO TV show featuring a mostly black cast...What I got was a messy show with terrible character development, caricatures and an absurd 180 of plot every five minutes.Managed to go from a strong 8.5-9 in the first episode down to the *SPOILER* anti-gay feeling high heel induced woman on man rape scene which landed it at a firm 3/10 (this episode was also my good sis POSE on FX? Where are we?).Let's pick an audience to pander and invest in some authentic storytelling.Also... ""B*tch Betta Have My Money"" in THAT time period... way to pull us out of it every chance you get. I'm so mad this show is like this because of my hopes for it."
164,"This series has wonderful actors, showing true emotion with love, fear and pain. The cinematography is acceptable and the CGI is forgivable. But what completely ruins the set and settings is the choice of music for each scene. It takes away all of the suspension and feeling from every scene, it ruins the hard work of every person that worked on this series. I really feel like this single stupid thing takes away everything that could have made this series awesome."
165,This show is unlike any other ever written. The casting is superior and the storytelling unlike any other. If you don't understand please continue to watch you will eventually get it. It always helps to join a group chat online or watch party. This show is a deep think show not a eat popcorn and giggle!
166,"The mix of magic, racism, and treasure hunting has kept my attention. The actors are amazing. The plot while it takes a few liveries from the book is on point. I love it!"
167,"Just the usual liberal woke left propaganda, nothing to see here. What a waste."
168,"OK episode 2 was a bit of a mess, but does form an important part of the story. Episode 3 is back to form. Whether it is your cup of tea or not and happy to watch spells, ghosts etc will vary. The cast is excellent and the ""all whites are bad"" trope makes a refreshing change. Happy to go along with the ride."
169,"I was really enjoying this series up until the fourth episode where they introduced a Native character. It's near impossible to have Native people represented on screen in non-stereotypes depictions, but despite the level of nudity she was introduced with I was intereseted to see where it would go. As a Native myself most people do't understand the complexity of the ""race"", but I was willing to overlook that in order to see representation in any form, but by the end of the episode a Black character kills her off despite the fact that she has been metaphorically silenced by other means. It's just sad. I wouldn't go as far to say that Native people have a worse history (despite near total genocide), but the lack of fair representation and the killing of one minority to another, it creates a symbol of hierarchy. Such a disappointment."
170,"To begin with, the title of the series was misleading.
The characters have a very flat structure and interact with each other in the same flat way. Thus no emotional bond to the characters can be established.
Black empowerment was tried to be depicted, but as bad as the character of the protagonists.
A wild, insufficiently coherent story, which was not told well.
The ending was one of the worst I have ever seen.
The actors were good, they can't be blamed for a bad base.
I would like to give 0 stars"
171,"It's mediocre.
What else is there so say, it's a good idea for a show badly realised, the acting is great but the storyline gets more boring nad boring."
172,"I really don't know how to start with review..
So i will choose to say nothing as series are doing so far.
1/10 and an easy don't waste your time with this.PS. i am really surprised for the average score which atm is at 7/10."
173,"It's classy, well written. very well acted and intelligently produced and directed. I'm currently watching Ep. 7 and still not so sure what exactly is going on, but I'm enjoying the ride.Episode 6 was beautifully done, even though it was mostly subtitles. (I'm not a fan of subtitles).Ignore the trolls and form your own opinion. Approach it with an open mind. You won't be disappointed."
174,"The show just kinda drags on. There are some nice visual effects in a few episodes so far. However, I find myself more often than not starting to just scroll through my phone after about the first 15 minutes of each episode. The pacing of the show just seems to be off and after 6 episodes now I am still struggling to find the real point of the story. I'll probably watch the remaining episodes of the season but unless it significantly gets better I don't think I would continue beyond that."
175,"Don't get me wrong, the 5 star score does not mean I try to put the series down, but this is no where near to the Lovecraft Mythos. On its own, the series is solid and has a good cast and acting and even special effects, but it failed to induce any Lovecraft horror element. The Lovecraft horror is not about the monsters, or about the action, but about the slow descent into madness as the witness takes part to something his/her mind can not comprehend, leaving them mentally scarred and destroyed no matter how strong they are. It is a horrible pain to see and, in part, ""The Color out of Space"" did achieve it (as silly as that movie turned out to be). If this was directed by someone who did Stephan King movies (Frank Darabont - The Mist) then we would have seen a very deep message painted here. People will say this is the first episode and that I have to wait for things to develop, but this is the problem, the first impression is the most important one to Lovecraft fans, and personally it did not hooked me up. To me, this is just another HBO monster flick that labels itself as Lovecraftian but has nothing solid to its ideology to backup that claim and feels more like a ""ScoobyDoo gang in search of Mysteries"". By all means, I highly recommend you watch and enjoy this series, just keep in mind that Lovecraft stories are far superior in narrative quality vs. what you get here.Also, I do not understand why so many users that gave it 10/10 are clearly new accounts made just to review this movie alone. This feels very unauthentic and forced. Even their names are easily recognizable as they are generated with numbers. It feels like the show-runners do not feel confident of their own talent that they have to artificially inflate the score. Personally, I respect the story and the fact that they approach it from a racial point of view and yes, it will divide some viewers on this matter. For me it's an irrelevant topic as I'm here for the cosmic horror (which is severely lacking) and not for political and racial differences that happen in usa."
176,"I lasted 40 mins into the first episode before switching off as this is supposedly the best. It's boring, clichéd, poorly acted and about as subtle as a wrecking ball. Rubbish."
177,"Censorship to protect certain delicate audiences. I'll be blunt; this show is a dark revenge fantasy with a supernatural/horror veneer. Not a good series but these days, this sort of PC approved shallow nonsense is trendy."
178,"This series is excellently written, directed, produced, and performed! The details are so well-thought, and the show makes me think. There are so many nuances included that makes this far different from any series I've ever seen. The cast, especially Jurnee Smollet, does a phenomenal job bringing it to life. There's never a dull moment."
179,"Entertaining for Sci Fi and Horror fans and those that love culture and history. Given Lovecrafts's revolting racism and his well read science fiction work, the title of the book and series show's the intellectual depth. Throw in a Denmark Vesey reference, Gordon Park's photo reference, too many to mention. The first episode was outstanding. Looking forward to the rest."
180,"An average script and play. First two episodes reveal major mysteries and then it just becomes an average detective/criminal/thriller show.
Separate pot in hell for soundtrack selection of some bi-polar genius. Why spoil ideally selected soundtrack of the epoch with not best of the class modern rap with auto-tune 🤢"
181,"This look like goosebumps episodes, the sound directing, the story, its all so comically bad. No suspense, no atmosphere. What a disappointment, and this has nothing to do with cosmic horror or Lovecraft, but that could be put aside if this was at least good entertainment, but its just plain bland and really boring."
182,"Weeeeeell....this is a series based on a book that leverages on the whole ""historical racism"" theme - and uses Lovecraft's mythos as a backdrop (and quite badly at that...).To avoid any discussions: any and all institutionalised racism is not only wrong but utterly stupid. One of the reasons we are still here as a race is that we MINGLE - so the gene pool never goes stale and leads us to a quick wipeout.That being said, this series is nothing but an exploit on political correctness and all that comes dangling on that chain.If you're into that sort of mind-numbing crap, you will have a banquet here. Otherwise, steer clear of it.
Brain damage ahead...."
183,"After always thinking about it when watching other blatantly overrated Shows, I really had to create an IMDB Account just to tell others how angry I am.I watched all 10 episodes, really trying my best to give this Show a the chance it deserves. First two episodes we're great but then ... I mean okay every Episode had its musical Number after that, If you are into that kind of stuff. Otherwise it was just an insult to logic or plot, feeling more like some unrelated episodic adventure. What angered me the most was that the magic didn't follow any rules, just deus-ex-magic whenever the plot had problems otherwise.
Oh how will they continue? Just new magic rule that didn't matter afterwards. Characters are shallow and unlikable, everything seems super forced and without Logic.Avoid at all costs, nobody will give you back the time you wasted."
184,I loved first episode...then just confusion. I don't understand why they had to change the book this way. A failed attempt for a series that had potential.
185,"There are so many parts of this I enjoyed.There are lots of ridiculous things going on in each episode, but I'm pretty good with suspending disbelief and rolling with them for the sake of a larger story. So I enjoyed how out-there the whole thing is. There's nothing else like it at the moment.The downside though is that it's real heavy-handed with the racial aspects of the story; Caucasians are all villainous, greedy and/or aggressive towards non-Caucasians. Non-caucasians (the only term I can think to describe the other actors) have greater depth of character, are more varied, and you can accept their flaws as being part of a complex person.Stick it out for the sci-fi/horror, it's worth it. But you might be rolling your eyes at overtly basic characterisation of 'white people'"
186,"After 3 episodes, i gave this series a 5 rating and dropped it off. Fool me!
Now that I watched it complete, just wow!
I was not ready for it, incredible, powerful and beautiful.
Everybody should know this story, and all Lovecraft/Sci-fi fans should enjoy it.
But don't be like me and have some patience for its depth to unfold.
I just started watching it again!"
187,"Whoever wrote that it was, obviously has never once picked up a Lovecraft tome, much less read a single story. There is no influence of Lovecraft other than a passing mention in the first episode. There are no old ones. There is no ocean or outer space imagery. There are no monsters (other than the first episode). Lovecraft with regard to this series exists only in the title. Each episode is So tonally inconsistent As to give you whiplash and populated with horrible characters doing ludicrous things only to advance the Plot Or to have sex. Episode 5, we're subjected to a fairly graphic gay sex scene, wedged into the episode as of to demonstrate how progressive they are. HPL, a product of his time and station, was fairly racist by today's standards. This was not Really portrayed in his works, but to have a show baring his name all about the condemnation of racism is a bit hypocritical. This is an extremely average show with great production values. It has no idea what it wants to be and no direction to get wherever that is. THERE IS NO LOVECRAFT HERE!"
188,"Started off good but lost me half way through episode 1. Episode 2 was worse. Seems like alot of different storylines thrown together which doesnt make sense nor compliment each other. Seems like youve missed episodes, as theyre so disjointed. Very disappointing to me."
189,"I love to see us in shows other than reality. The acting and storyline is amazing. SCIFi, mystery, romance, history and more. I look forward to every episode. May I add, the sound track is fire!!!"
190,"Horrible mess of weak plot, magic, aliens, monsters, cults all jammed together . Main character is often incomprehensible while whispering or talking in a calm manner. Soundtrack is not even mediocre, it's bad. I mean elevator music level bad. And last, but not least, it has nothing to do with Lovecraft."
191,"Great show!!! Amazing acting, each episode is with a different style and a little bit scary, the only thing I don't like is it being based in the 1950's and has modern music playing as background music, feels like it kills the vibe 😕 Other than that it's a really great show!!!!"
192,"Not unenjoyable, but rather hammy, :especially the baddies and the plot seemed to jump forward sometimes without filling in the gaps, I kept rewinding as I thought I had inadvertently fast-forwarded."
193,"Just watch it. It makes you uncomfortable, it creeped me out. It also os the only show I watch ( I dont watch Tv) because most things on now are predictable. This is not and it seems someone did their research"
194,"The first episode was excellent; great characters, an interesting premise and some good SFX. By episode five it's turned into a children's show with added sex, violence and swearing."
195,"I'm not sure what it is but on the 4th episode i kind of gave up caring for the characters... i found myself wanting to skip forward... to get to something interesting, i wasn't finding it in the dialogue and the relationships between the characters just didn't seem real enough... as if they were just reading a script and I was just waiting for some cool CGI to carry things forward..."
196,"Ok, it started as promising thriller, if not horror, with kinda universal scientific/fantasy setting you can do whatever you want in.
Then it went trashy with more TrueBlood vibes, and lost all that gloss of high-quality stuff but still was intertaining and good-looking enough to watch ferther.
Discrimination theme is kinda trendy right now and the story is about black people.
And most of horror elements are actually about white people discriminating black rather then about some supernatural stuff.
But closer to the end main characters go wild too much,
Never thought that with this type of setting I find myself empathizing to white aristocratic villain girl. But she was sincere and adequate, when main characters are chaotic, violent and treacherous. It feels like a major flaw of the story. And ruins overal impression of the title drastically"
197,"Great acting and writing, love this show.I can't wait to see more."
198,"This show seriously blew me away. It was AMAZING. A lot more sci-fi than I thought (stupid of me I know), but that's a very good thing. Amazing acting, stellar writing, kept me on the edge of my seat. I'm a baby when I comes to scary tv/films, but I'm sticking it out because this show is too good to not see."
199,"Superbly done!!! Not a fan of sci-fi, but so far this show has made me a fine. Music complements the scenes , the action doesn't seem over the top."
200,"I loved the first episode, it was promising a lot .
So much potential, and several genres presented very well .
The 1950s portrayal of racism in particular was credible and disturbing.Unfortunately, the series then became a nonsensical succession of stereotypes, both in terms of content and style .It's a shame for viewers and the movement the show seems to try and represent, that the quality of film making and intellectual comprehension was subpar .Nice editing, mediocre special effects; the cast and the acting , and the screenplay were horrid .
The actors being the main offenders, what a pathetic display by all of them .Well, if this is woke, it doesn't do it any favours ."
201,"I've been waiting for Lovecraft Country nearly all year, and the anticipation was not unwarranted. The premiere episode was everything I hoped and dreamed it would be.The acting, cinematography, writing, set design, and wardrobe were all top notch (as we've all come to expect from HBO). This first episode really does a fantastic job of taking you back in time.My favorite part was the way that my expectations were completely upended by the ending. I thought I knew what this series was going to be about, but now I have no idea where they are going to take us, and I couldn't be more excited!"
202,"""Just going over a bridge named after some dead slave owner....."" Nothing political going on here, right, right?In spite of the positive reviews, many of which feel like they were written by marketing agencies, full of zesty adjectives, its next to impossible to view this series as ""just entertainment"".That's regrettable too, because that's just what we all need at the moment. The colour of the casts skin should not and does not matter. That said, dropping yet more political messages, into what is supposed to be entertainment, is downright tiresome.On the upside the acting is solid and the creepy story line could have worked too, if not for the incessant need to lecture.5/10."
203,"Really wanted to like this and I have the views of many people here, how epidoses 1-3 start off great, then tapers off into tedium. Too many stories that were broached but finished off in a rushed way, making the series drag on and on, to the point of becoming a trial to watch.The effects are top notch, so is the acting, monsters and magic you gotta love that, but then it just wallows in its own smugness and I doubt whether I'll be sticking it out for series 2 and that's a real shame.Tme to find another series that will get me hooked, because this left me flat."
204,Headline says it all. It's boring. I had high hopes and I renewed my HBO subscription but if this keeps up I'll cancel it again.
205,"Not sure why people think this is so good or so bad?
The characters are a bit one dimensional even though the actors are trying their best to give them some substance. The acting is pretty good considering the script and the stories they're working with are pretty poor. I hate the way its set in the 50's yet they go from 50's era music into modern hiphop (I love hiphop but it's just out of place here).
For the reviewers that keep chirping on about how it's nothing like H.P. Lovecraft, it's not meant to be. It's based on a modern book written by a different author.
The quality of the show varies in each episode. I enjoyed some episodes but episode 4 turned into all the worst elements of The Goonies with a bit of Indiana Jones and the last crusade thrown in for the hell of it.
All in all it's just OK. It's not really worth the budget they've given it. I'd spend all those dollars on something with a bit more consistency or sell it to netflix cos they'll throw money at any old rubbish these days whilst they cancel all their best shows (just wanted to have a dig at netflix there really).
To summarise some bad episodes and some ok episodes."
206,The show started ok and was very pointed in addressing racial issues. It then just became a non-sensical jumbled mess. The ending was just a waste. I wont be back for the next season.
207,I never read the book the series is based on. I came into the show expecting too much with Mr. Peele as a producer. And honestly the first couple of episodes really had me drawn in. Then slowly the stories were spreading and getting worse and worse. Feeling so forced that it all fell apart to me. And the ending was barely able to wrap it up. It was messy. The acting is pretty good. The effects were ok most of the time. But the writing is what ruined the show. It could have gone so many other places and settled to be so hum drum and repetitive then predictive and ultimately completely disappointing. I really hope they do not give it a second season.
208,This shoe probably has the best first episode of any show seen in HBO. Whilst among the 10 episodes there are some great ones thereafter the pace remains uneven with some episodes dragged on unnecessarily. The season finale was also disappointing considering the expectations. It's good but could have been great and overall a missed opportunity.
209,I was expecting a great episode to begin this series and it surpassed that. Incredible start. Can't wait to see where things go next.
210,This story is not strong enough to carry on past the completely out of place Jefferson' theme dance routine at the start of episode 2. It also is not Lovecraft - for anyone who's read the real thing. It's a really stupid show which pulls out all the stops for the first episode. Nothing worth watching thereafter.
211,"This started off well and was good until 3-4 episodes. After that it was just pain to watch. Some side actors have overacted. The plot also is just complete bs moving from one thing to next with no explanation.
I just fast forwarded it to see the end.
Save your time and watch something else."
212,"I really want to love this show. I came in expecting a True Detective-esque show with more actual supernatural elements. My expectations were immediately thrown out the window. Next I expected a show more akin to True Blood. Again, expectations thrown out the window.Unlike True Detective that slow burns, this show jumps and jumps and jumps some more. Unlike True Blood, this show gives you so much so quick you are left confused if you're not taking notes and have no room to appreciate what you've just seen because you're already 3 plot points away.Every episode could be a season or a movie on its own. I don't mean that as a compliment-I mean it as a disappointing critique. The pacing is horrible. The acting is fantastic. There is an amazing plot underneath the mess if it has room to shine.I feel like this show is trying to meet an expectation from some Executive producer or CEO rather than the writer, director, or whoever's vision.All that being said it is very watchable and I keep finding myself waiting for the next episode to find out what's going to happen. There is something there underneath the breakneck jumps to new plot points. I just wish the show would give us time to digest and sit with the scene and the characters more.I hope this show gets green lit for another season and they check the pacing. There is an EXCELLENT show inside the CHAOS that this first season has been so far. Please someone just give the plot the space it needs. I gave it 6, the strongest possible 6 I could possibly give. Bring Ava DuVernay on or Shonda Rhimes on as a creative consultant and this will be a MUST watch (Hell, I'll even take Weiss and .Benioff if it means this show can get the space it needs to become what it should be)."
213,"I'm not into comic book series and this is or should be one. Fine acting, a good storyline and high production values are essential for me to rate something highly. The cgi special effects are good, not spectacular. The acting is fair and the storyline is pathetic, bouncing from one nonsense situation to another. I watched 2 episodes. Done. It is, as far as I am concerned unredeemable. I have to be involved in the characters and what happens to them. Couldn't care less. Secret societies, secret rings, secret monsters, secret powers...better they had kept the whole thing a big secret."
214,"I have no idea why this has such a low rating, it feels brilliantly written and executed. It may be because I'm not black. But I love Jordan Peele and this show is my new favorite obsession. The music, the story, the pace. Spot on. I look forward to more episodes!!"
215,"How many times can you get the main characters to jump into bed together, seems to be the question writer Misha has asked herself from ep.3 and onward. I'm sorry, this isn't good enough. The story is starting to get real thin."
216,"This show is a bit of everything that i want. Black history, sci-fi, horror,& facts! Misha Green is a great producer and the cast is all star! You have to understand what's going on to appreciate it. Jurnee is doing an awesome job as Leti. I hope it gets many seasons because I'm a fan for life! Runners never quit and we are strapped for the ride."
217,"I want to like this show so bad, but HBO did what they usually do. They take a good story and say, ""Oh, we can make this better!"" Just one problem. They can't!This show is like GoT season 2 bad. You want to watch it because you love the story but it breaks your heart. There a snippets of good decisions, getting you excited, and then they let you down.Some changes I'm onboard with. The small ones that don't change the story but did better visuals than what the book would have provided (episode 4), but a lot of the changes don't make any sense. They just changed them for no purpose. It actually hurts the story and severs plot lines.I get changing a book for tv. That makes sense, but not in this case. Should have kept the characters to the original story. I hate how they dumbed down ""Tisha"". She was clever in the book, but now they almost make her helpless. Shame on whoever made this decision.Oh, and no Caleb Braithwight. Guess they decided ""Christina"" would hit a wider demographic. Too bad they found the most bland actor they could find for that character too. Another poor decision. I'll finish the first season, but I'll be honest, it's painful to watch what they've done to this story. Like watching friends get knocked around..."
218,"Lovecraft Country takes a show, based on works from an author with inherent bias towards black people, and flips it on its head. Atticus is a strong and willful veteran trying to find his father. Uncle George is forging a safe path for people to travel and see the country. The setting of 1950s Jim Crowe America sets the tone for a racially driven narrative, during a racially tumultuous time in America. It doesn't matter if you are white or black. The 50s happened, this is fact. The racial discrimination that happens in this show, happened then, and to an extent, is still happening now. If you can't move past the fact that some people that look like you, do TERRIBLE and AWFUL MURDEROUS acts during this show, you might need to take a retrospective look at your world view and your self importance. The protagonists in the first two episodes are black. They are strong. They are wholesome. They care about family. That's America. I love this show, and hope it continues to show the horrific monsters of Lovecraft lore, and sheds a probing light on the nostalgic view of ""America of Yore."" 8/10 because the story is excellent so far, but some of the visuals/visual effects have been jarring from poor green screen/digital effects.Steve"
219,"Take Lovecraft off the title,it's insulting.Do not waste your time watching this awful show"
220,"No spoilers here, but I've been waiting for this show since I first read it was in development. Just watched episode 1 and I can already see that this is/will be one of my favorite HBO series of all time if it continues at the level of quality we've seen so far.The characters, setting and dialog are fantastic. It's just great story telling so far, I can't wait to see how the season unfolds."
221,The acting is excellent but the monster scenes are a tad cliched and prosaic. It has some real potential and I'm looking forward to the next episode.
222,"The crazy mix of horror, sci fi, adventure, with the undertones of racial injustice is something I have never seen before. You never know what to expect each episode. This show is excellent."
223,This series is exciting and refreshing. The acting and historical references mixed in with the scifi element is brilliant and well done
224,"Historical fiction and H.P.Lovecraft weird sci-fi fantasy! I absolutely love this show from the minds of Jordan Peele and Misha Green. The screenplay, music, and actors are all superb. The show honors the novel by Matt Ruff with respectable differences."
225,"And a whole lotta people down-rating this show whilst claiming they know what the real Lovecraft is all about. First of all, you don't. Second, the show is based on ""Lovecraft Country"" by Matt Ruff. Which is a book. You should try reading it.Third, Peele is growing beautifully with Lovecraft Country. The camera work is excellent, the production design is first rate, and the story seems to bother a whole lotta white people, some of whom claim they've had enough or are having trouble stomach ing the show because of BLM. Please disregard the closet racists, too, and enjoy this production as intended: a story.
It's a story whose protagonists are black people in the Jim Crow Era forced to deal with supernatural horrors. Sure, there's an intended Lovecraftian vibe, but that's it. Sure, it's nowhere near perfect and there are things I would have written/shot/edited differently, but I'm giving this all my love because too many people invoke HP Lovecraft like they really know what this show is about.It's a great show with plenty of potential. The characters are deliciously nerdy and interesting, as is the original plot, which I hope the show will follow because the book was actually quite good. The realism will be disturbing to a lot of white people, but that is to be expected. It's inspired by reality and American history. It's supposed to make you feel uncomfortable. I'd say 8 out of 10 based on 2 episodes, for now. Chances are it will get more out of me along the way. Peele has a style of his own."
226,"I didn't know what to expect, especially after the first few minutes, but I was thoroughly impressed and completely hooked! I'm looking forward to the rest of the season! Best Sci-Fi I've seen in years!"
227,I read Lovecraft as a child and enjoyed it. It wasn't until many years later I understood the racial insanity he suffered from. I can't wait to see how this series turns that aspect of Lovecraft inside out while giving us gorgeous cinematography conveying the horror in this beautiful landscapes. The acting was great and natural and I loved the references to older black photography (Gordon Parks is one).
228,"This is a well done show. The cinematography is great. Acting is decent. HOWEVER, the show feels more like an anthology series. I mean, from one episode to the next, you can see these jumps in the storytelling. There are illogical time gaps and unnecessary side character devoted episodes. It's like the show forgot who the lead was. It just feels disjointed. I will say this show isn't for everyone."
229,"It starts as a 12 years a slave type movie, excellent, tense, rivetring then becomes kinda ""Davinci Code"" movie , with snippets of ideas from ""Predators"" . Overall is excellent. Smullett is hot . All the Black actors deserve an award. Excellent acting."
230,"This is one of those series that probably should have been delivered with a fewer number of episodes.
There was definitely a promising core thread in the beginning episodes and some good scenes but faded as episodes progressed.
At times all the extra ""period"" style and drama can seem like filler.
I like most of the eye candy but looking at vintage cars and clothing can't save a confused and weakening story.
Similarly, the racial elements might be interesting to some but often feel like they belong in a totally different show.
So... I watch, enjoy some and just skip ahead when things start to stray or bog down in some unnecessary drama.
The last episode was mostly boring and the ultimate disappointment, you might want to pass it altogether.
Since it has become so easy to record shows, awarding stars (or not) now depends on how much/little I use my fast forward button."
231,"I have this 10/10 because that's what it deserves, well written, well acted and genuinely well presented, I like the supernatural approach and I think the historical aspect (no matter how discusting) is genius. I hope this lasts a long time to come! Another win for HBO. Can't wait for the next episode."
232,Second episode and I'm still loving it. The entire cast is wonderful but Jonathan Majors has really sold me on this show. Give it a chance if you're trying to decide on if you want to watch it or not.
233,"This show is amazing! Misha, Jordan, and J.J. have done a superb job of blending history and horror. There are so many layers to each episode. If you know American History (all of it) you can see the layers and see all of the hidden gems they have artfully placed in the script and on the set. I was a little afraid to watch it initially because I don't enjoy horror films as much as I used to. But, I decided to give it a try and I AM HOOKED!. THANK YOU HBO!"
234,I loved it. The acting and authenticity of the time is fantastic! Can't wait to see what happens in the upcoming season. I'm hooked.
235,"Given that the story makes no sense or perhaps there isn't one, this series is remarkably well cast and very well acted. The special effects are awesome. And there is an excessive amount of gore. Not for the squeamish or the faint-hearted."
236,"This is the most fantastic series in a long time. It breaks conventions left and right, fantastic storyline, great acting, all while confronting the viewer with the terror of racism in a true Jordan Peel way."
237,"In this world of immediate gratification impatient people, like me, have to sit down and push away our 'just add water and two minutes in the microwave, bam you're fed"" programming. This is a challenge for me- perhaps this is why I like the show. I am left with more questions than answers and for the time being is okay. I hope the story arc will become clearer. We have six episodes left to prove that. Nevertheless I look forward to every Sunday evening.As an actor I am absolutely blown away by the talent and skill that is coming out of everyone of those actor's pores.I am not familiar with the source material and have only a vague understanding of Lovecraft's horror aesthetic. Perhaps this is why I am coming to it with a more open mind then I might have otherwise.The biggest thing I appreciate out of this show is the representation and the light that is shed on our sordid American history living in us today."
238,"Beautifully done, down to the fine details. Pure horror monster flick."
239,"Really thought the first episode was as great. I appreciate anything that can mix American history with science fiction and do it well. Good narrative, can't wait for the next episode."
240,"But I tell you what it kept me on the edge of my seat. I don't usually do a lot of horror, thriller, suspense stories. But I like supernatural stories. I've never heard of The Lovecraft Country but I plan to sit down and read the books.The twist, turns, disppointments and mega victories are not missing on this show. I'm so happy it's a series. If this were just a movie it wouldn't be enough. I love how much the show looks likes it wants to be normal but then there's always that twist. That's what kept me lost in show. I binged on it until I wast like wait I feel like I've been watching for 10 hours. But I was only 4 episodes in. I promise if your looking for something binge worthy. This is it!"
241,Okay so I saw alot of trailers for this show and after carefully thinking about it I watched a episode and boy I'll tell you now it takes a while to get started don't get me wrong but it's one of the absolute best shows of this new decade or of the previous one the action is packed to the core and adventure is there too I can't recommend it any higher 2 thumbs way way up
242,"This show started off fantastic then about 5 episodes down it lost its touch. What happened to the story ? I say remove the ""lovecraft"" name because the name is now tarnished."
243,"We were skeptical at first due to how slow it took to get going, we thought it was going to be boring. Boy were we wrong, this show has taken us on one hell of a ride. & I thought Watchmen was good. This is better! Very deep, haven't seen any show or movie do it this way. Phenomenal job to the creators and actors. We love this show!!! Stay WOKE Fam!"
244,"Brilliant show! Lovecraft country brings an incredibly complex and mesmerizing plot, top-notch acting, great cinematography, and tackles major issues from white supremacy to racism and slavery in the medical field. I love shows that require critical though and harbor discussion- this one definitely does that all while being exciting and monster-filled. Hopefully season 2 is renewed because this is the best show I've seen since Dark!"
245,"I knew nothing of H.P Lovecraft, but have found out he was a racist. Then I found out that this show is based on a book that came out in 2016.Regardless of all of that, this show is good writing, good actors, set in the 50s and is based off of truth of how we were treated and have historical characters that you will find interesting on how they intertwined them in the story line. Please watch!"
246,Cant believe Omar took part in this cartoon like tv show
247,This was a phenomenal premier for what looks to be an amazing series. The blend of the horror found in our own backyards with the otherworldly horror of Lovecraft was poignant and enthralling. These are the stories and characters we need.
248,Lovecraft Country is really getting under the skin of so many hateful trolls and I wouldn't have it any other way. This is such a special show for so many and it's already a hit so GET USED TO IIIITTTT.
249,The first episode is definitely a slow burn until the last 15ish minutes get past that and you're in for a treat
250,I've watched 5 episodes so far and its by far my favorite show of the year. The originality of this show and the challenging perspectives it puts to viewers added with the unpredictability I'm amazed at how its made. A gem of a show.
251,Love this! Its so unique and each episode is different but within the same storyline! Its got fab ideas and makes u want to watch more! Each episode gets better and better! My favourite is episode 5 so far!
252,"This series started off great, but the focus of the plot is all over the place. Hard to follow. Some scenes are very hard to watch. After watching episode 5 , I'm done !!!"
253,"This is an incredible series. Action, drama, comedy and a love story. Not to mention the truth and realism of the treatment of our people.
Another hit series that makes them uncomfortable.
Great writing.
#underground"
254,"I really like this series. Love the visuals, suspense, the action, the stories....all of it! Look forward to next installment each time. Brilliant work on all accounts."
255,Normally I never watch horror (scares me half to death) but I went into watching this blind having no idea this series was a horror. That being said I just couldn't turn it off. The writing & acting is brilliant. I may never sleep again.
256,"Like other reviewers have said, it's not Lovecraftian in the sense that it resembles his writing. It *is* Lovecraftian in that it feels very similar to games of the Call of Cthulhu tabletop RPG I've played. Regular people investigating supernatural events, being antagonized not only by monsters but by the authorities, people having sudden breakdowns when confronted by the unknown. It's fun too see on the screen.The acting and writing are very good. The special effects are good enough. The characters are engaging, and the history is eye-opening. I highly recommend it."
257,"So far I am loving Lovecraft Country - it's a great balance of Sci-Fi, Horror, and historical connections. The show goes even deeper with a good number of small historical references. The acting is also superb! Definitely check it out!!"
258,This is one of the best shows on TV right now. I hope it gets another season.
259,"I am amazed at the depth, the nuance, and the in-your-face brazenness of the weekly story lines. I love that this is set in a time when so much was happening in and to the black community but so little was said about it. The characters and casting is perfection. I can't wait for it each week!"
260,"HBO still knows where to put the money. They're the most consistently good television network out there, still making quality stuff, and my most recently favorite shows are made by them. One more point to them for Lovecraft Country. Even though it's only been one episode, it's got me hooked, line and sink. It's the welcoming refresh we need. When I see it as a whole, it feels like the better subversion of expectations of the works of HP Lovecraft. Lovecraft is one of the most prolific horror authors in history; he was also a known racist and horrible person. Talking about his work is a delicate balance of the two, but Lovecraft Country took that balance and turned it on its head. Most of his work was a consistent slight against other races or creeds, especially African Americans, but the HBO show pulls a great switcheroo; we make them the main characters, people who have a goal, depth and things about them we like and care about. You never really see that in any other Lovecraft adaptations; makes for a great change of pace and excited to see what happens next. With Jordan Peele and JJ Abrams as producers, it feels like a nice combination for weird stuff to go down. The first episode is very reminiscent of Watchmen and how it deals with race, but both shows handle the subject much better than anyone else does. HBO takes it seriously while others just candy coat it and turn it into a cookie cutter boiler plate. It's got great acting, great special effects, an interesting story, a great combination of setting and horror; basically everything that makes a tv show cinematic and worth watching. You got me, HBO, so now I'm settled in for what happens next."
261,The *real* monster in this tale is the exposure of the *real* racism that took place in our not so distant past. The acting is brilliant. The sets and costumes are phenomenal. I also love how the writers intertwine real life horrors into the plot.
262,"I believe the negative reviews are mainly from yt people who don't get it, or who don't want to get it which i'm not shocked or surprised about because its in their DNA to hate on everything we do lol.to my point, I highly recommend this series. its magical, excellent writing, unbelievable character development, fantastic world-building, and most importantly its very very very unpredictable - but in the best way possible."
263,"I love this show because of the unhealthy societal narratives that it challenges in mostly organic ways. I am a scifi fan and the episodes to this point have been entertaining, but have been more horror and gore focused than I prefer. The episode entitled Meet Me in Daegu is the last one to have aired as of this review and it is brilliant - really solid storytelling which I find incredibly inspiring, especially during a time that artistic talent seems lacking in most shows. It very directly challenges common unhealthy conceptions, but it does so authentically through the plot rather than constant clunky and out of place dialogue which seems to be the trend right now in other shows. This episode is sci-fi with a hint of gore which for me is the right balance. It shows the shades of grey in some polarizing situations and people. I think choosing to have so much of the dialogue be done in a language other than English serves an important, subversive purpose. I would have left this review specifically for that episode which I rate higher than my overall rating, but decided to leave it here because it displays the same elements I like from the rest of the episodes, just better."
264,"So lots of reviews here saying that the show does not get Lovecraft right or that the show is just playing off the Lovecraft name.Given that the show is based on the book Lovecraft Country by Matt Ruff which plays both on the blatant, explicit in his own words, white supremacist, facist views of H.P. Lovecraft combined with the iconography of his fiction, that criticism misses the point of the story/show title and the core of both the story and show which is to turn Lovecraft's universe on its head. In short the show is a series of parables and morality plays regarding black Americans fighting against the very real racism and segregation of the 1950's with the twist of the supernatural.Like all such efforts its characters are recognizable archetypes and don't have huge depth but do what archetypes do in morality plays- play out the battle between good and evil.In doing so, it confronts Lovecraft's dystopian, amoral, anti-humanist vision as well his concrete expression of supremacist fascist occultism.Lack of depth, however, does not mean bad acting. The cast is solid and Majors and Smollette are great leads with Vance, Musako, Ellusand Williams as backup. Both Lee and Smith do evil very well.This is very good melodrama with social conscience and fun. If you are looking for high drama try Chekov.If the show went as horrific and dystopian as Lovecraft it would miss the point it is trying to make and its audience would be smaller.A few final notes should be made given some of the reviews here. There were in fact thousands of restricted towns and counties in the midwest and northeast United States well into the 1970's when the Civil Rights Act and other legislation started dismantling not only redlining and housing discrimination but school segregation on a more aggressive stance. To suggest otherwise ignores any sort of reality."
265,"It's a pretty good fantasy (not Sci-fi although pseudo-sciency) story.My main drawback is that the plotline is very discombobulated. The flow is just strange. It's kind of like The X Files where you have core mythology and then monster of the week episodes, only in Lovecraft Country those two genres are intermixed in nearly every episode.My secondary drawback is related to what makes the show special. Obviously the show has a primarily black cast. I was hoping it would simply be a really good fantasy horror show with a majority black cast, that would be great. The show is a horror show and does a good job at portraying the horror of racism in the 1950s. I was baffled though by the direction this ended up taking. (SPOILERS AHEAD). I'm fine with the over the top portrayal of nearly every white person being a raging homicidal racist, it is a horror show after all, but in the finale Leti makes it so no white person can ever have magic again... WTF? I haven't read the book so I'm not sure who to blame, but are they trying to make Black people out to be the monsters? Or maybe the point is everyone is a monster? Either way the intent is confusing."
266,"The show is everything that WE have been asking for. If you are going to make a show during a specific period, especially civil rights movement, then make it factual. This is factual. Additionally, to whoever said this is bad horror maybe that can be subjective. At times I am horrified and I think that some things just hit the audience differently depending on your cultural perspective. If you don't ""get it"" then that's ok, but that doesn't make it terrible. Everything isn't for everybody. This show is superb and just based on the first few episodes it deserves a second season at minimum. The characters can further develop and I look forward to the future."
267,I love the characters and the fashion! I love the historical references interwoven. Love everything about this show! Each episode is more intense than the last! What a master work of horror!!! Peele and Abrams are a dynamic force. MORE! MORE! MORE!
268,"As someone not familiar with the original novels, I've really enjoyed this through Episode 2! A good combo of story and superficial worlds!"
269,"I've never seen a show lay it on so thick. They act like ALL white people in the 1960s were genocidal maniacs-or that America was as dangerous as the Amazon Basin for black people,
Rather than being a television program it plays more like a lecture on critical race theory (yes, folks they do play such a lecture in lieu of sound track during one montage)
Seriously, shooting people for sitting down? The whole scene was so preposterous... I'm know this sort of thing happened, but do you wanna have a show about struggles in the civil rights era or one about the world of HP Lovecraft? Make up your minds
I gave it a few stars because the acting is good and I like the characters, but if the shows producers want people to take these issues seriously, they might need to add a dose of subtlety."
270,"I've seen ALL of Jordan Peel's horror works, from Get Out, remake of the Twilight Zone to Us.I just finished watching the first episode, and it felt so fantastically realistic, I was petrified on my seat. Throughout the episode, there were little snip bits of hints scattered around the episode that set an ominous vibe to the environment. Nothing was rushed, undeveloped or sudden (there was a little jump scare). But all the characters have story to them and help you begin developing emotional attachment.
The songs in there are also very enjoyable!Normally when I'd read reviews, I'll start with the bad first but in this case, DONT READ THE BAD REVIEWS. Those reviewers are basing theirs views on being uncomfortable with black actors/pretty much history itself as well as THE INCORRECT ASSUMPTION THAT ITS BASED ON LOVECRAFT. The series is based on ""Lovecraft Country"" by Matt Ruff, where the lead IS a black man. Thus there's not ""racial overtones"", because IT IS true to the novel."
271,"Everything is in place here, nothing to add. A must see for every AHS and Preacher fan."
272,And i LOVE the music...people saying they dont like it cuz its not from the period...ur dense. Especially love the scene where her sister gags and ties up that guy then sodomizes him with her stiletto whilst shedding her white woman flesh all over his office. #goals
273,"This show is amazing! It gets better every week. Misha, Jurnee, Jonathan and the rest of the cast/crew are doing the thing!! Although I'm usually not a fan of horror/gore I can't stop watching. 10/10 would highly recommend!!"
274,"I keep getting the Supernatural vibe out of this show, and I love it. Characters are well written, acting is perfect, and story gets you hooked for more."
275,"I love it. Very interesting show. The actors did a great job,can't wait til the next episode."
276,"There's a lot to enjoy in this especially visually... the cinematography, sets and costumes are beautiful and captivating. And the acting is generally strong.And it's a wonderful, refreshing experience to watch a show that in which almost all the main characters are black, and it gives some rich insight into what life might have been like in 50s America (and how - sadly - too many of those prejudices exist today).If for no other reason than that, I really, really wanted to like this.But man, the plot is a sloppy, disjointed mess and the script is clunky and predictable. That makes it really hard to enjoy the show. But the saddest consequence of those two weaknesses is that it harms the characters. You want to get to know them more but half the time they're just saying cliche, melodramatic nonsense that lacks any real depth or nuance. The rest of the time you're so distracted by the absolute madness of the plot to care about the characters. No spoilers but this show throws everything at you. And I mean, EVERYTHING! That could be a super-cool rollercoaster ride but it's done in such a muddled, frantic way.There's no world-building - you just jump right in to this unrelenting series of unbelievably weird and crazy things. But the main characters are just normal people but they basically never seem particularly phased by all these unbelievable things.Once again this impacts the characters. They don't feel authentic because they seem to just be totally fine with a never-ending succession of supernatural occurrences. Like, they sometimes seem scared in the moment, but immediately afterwards they've just taken it totally in their stride and they're on to the next mad thing. And because there's such a frantic rush from one weird thing to the next you don't really get to know the characters as real people... you just see them kinda bouncing from one ridiculous scene to the next.Overall, it's just a bit of a mess, and it's totally failed to really capture my attention. I've stuck with it and will finish it just to see what new made things it has to offer... but at this point it is mostly stubbornness with a bit of curiosity, rather than actual enjoyment."
277,After the first episode it took us weeks to be bothered to watch the next one and we gave up after 30 minutes of that. You don't get to care about anyone and it's all a bit lazy and silly in the writing and plot. And I say this despite having read some lovecraft and playing the RPG at uni.
278,"Who complains that this is not Lovecraft is one of those who thinks that putting tentacles on things is Cthulhu. Stop complaining, why do you even comment and review stuff if you don't like it? Celebrate what you like and ignore what you don't, there is so much to watch these days. I love it and I will celebrate it as much as I can. You guys calling this show trash are like the ones who watch other people having fun from the windows, hating them for having a life."
279,"Kinda wish the dream sequence at the beginning was more indicative of the movie, but nonetheless, it is an awesome series. Peele does awesome work yet again. I can't wait to see tge new Twilight Zone.The title caught me, because I like the Lovecraftian outre horror.....but this is based on the novel.....NOT written by Lovecraft. That doesn't make it not Lovecraftian by any means. Just not what an HPL fan might be looking for.Still it caught me and kept me. The characters are engaging, the acting top notch, and the storyline keeps you binge watching.The racism it contains might make some people uncomfortable...and it should. This is what happened and STILL happens to black people even in this modern day and age, so yes, it should cause discomfort. It adds to the horror, showing the human monsters as well as creepy crawly monsters... both of which are things of nightmares.I'm all caught up, waiting for the next episode and hoping for more seasons."
280,"Misha Green knocks another one out of the ballpark, I remember her brilliant series Underground, now she brings her talents to HBO with LoveCraft.We watch with intense emotions as these brave black americans find their way through the weirdness of sci fi and actual relations of the Jim Crow and hateful racism in America.
One has to understand what the monsters actually represent and not just take it as a segment to scare the hell out of you but what it means in their journey.
Jurnee Smollett is magnificent in her role as a strong black woman determined to find out all of the truth. Along with the rest of the cast I commend HBO for taking on this often times
swept away subject."
281,"Reading the many negative reviews it's plain to see the persons who enjoy the show have melanin and those that don't are..... one review asked how people of color would feel if they were portrayed as the villains.. ( welcome to our world)...that was laugh worthy. Another review said the ""racism"" is unrealistic as there are no sundown towns that far north. Its laughable cause there are still sundown towns today in 2020, and black people get harassed living in neighborhoods e.g. Valley stream, long island.I love the show. I've learned so much. I love the subtle references to Prince hall lodges, Emmitt BoBo Till, the Tuskegee experiments, voodoo, the arawak Indians, pioneering, the green book...so much more. It's a show for smart people. So I'm not shocked when people don't get it."
282,"It is everything I didn't know I needed, can't wait for season 2 and beyond, these first 4 episodes have been more then what I could have thought this show would have been"
283,"I am a huge fan of Fantasy, Mystery and Horror theme. I have not read the book and i do not care. It started out slow at the first episode but wait for it. Just finished the 3rd episode and i am totaly hooked. Its interesting and captivating. Acting and storytelling is good. Nice cgi effects. I am glad i did not listen to other critics. I always watch it and judge it by myself. I do not care what other people said. I can recommend it if you like what i said above."
284,"Really enjoy this show, ignore the extreme reviews, they are written by people trying to silence black creators."
285,"This show is amazing. From the very first episode on, it keeps me sitting on the edge of my seat. I've watched each episode multiple times and discover a new piece to the puzzle. I highly recommend."
286,"Huge scope of characters, most larger than life in the most believable way. Incites a mixture of sorrow and anger over the audacious segregation of the 50's while mixing in a thrilling and captivating surreal plot that dominates the watch."
287,"First episode was good... then it becomes BLM propaganda. Quite lame turn.
Could have been a great show"
288,"Edit: after watching the last episode I removed 2 stars from the rating
Let's be clear, I don't know if the novel is any different but there is almost nothing Lovecraftean to be found here. This shameless name-dropping is my main complaint with the show, which is otherwise good, though very uneven. More specifically:Episodes 1 & 2: Clark Ashton Smith-ish country with a lot of August DerlethStarts with the only references to HPL you'll find - a dream that includes Cthulhu, and a discussion of the 'Lovecraft country' region (and ahem, ArDham, where not one person looks fishy) and addressing HPL's racism (necessary point given the series' eventual subject matter). Admittedly, the first episode's introduction to the extreme racism that permeates the show (and at least then-America) is powerful. There's also some Evil Dead in here, but the bloodthirsty monsters seemed totally out of place.
And then? Magicians. Yes, magicians - but these guys are not summoners of eldritch horrors, nor are they necromancers wallowing in the decadence of Zothique, as C.A. Smith would have it. No, they perform low fantasy spells. Worse still, there is a secret society that wants to open a portal to the...garden of Eden and a main element to the overall plot is the language of Adam (I can smell Derleth's undesirable christian, good vs evil morality edits across time and space). Serious question: Why not open a portal to the primeval ooze of UBBO-SATHLA? He has the tablets with the knowledge of the Elder Gods. MUCH MORE RELEVANT than the bloody garden of Eden.I will admit the idea of a ""Nomicon"" as counter-Necronomicon is smart.Episodes 3-4: (mass produced) Robert Howard countryEpisode 3 is a mediocre haunted house story, while episode 4 might as well have been an episode of Young Indiana Jones (or Relic Hunter - remember Tia Carrere?), with museum artifacts, secret passages and traps, all - and I can't stress this enough - very cheaply done, like adventure stories R.E.Howard wrote by the dozensEpisode 5: I don't have a name for this - an episode where a black woman takes a magic potion and turns into a white woman. Obvious symbolism, clear message, needless gore, can be missed.Episode 6: Hentai CountryA (relatively) bold view into the Korean war (and american war crimes). And then...tentacles! Are we there? Are the stars right? No, wait, it's THAT kind of tentacles. Still, a very good episode.Episode 7: Edgar Rice Burroughs CountryThe protagonist's middle-aged, housewife aunt suddenly knows advanced maths, astronomy and whatever else is needed, and a machine transports her to another planet. FINALLY. IT MUST BE THE GREAT RACE OF YITH - OR AT LEAST YUGGOT...no, wait, is that alien Diana Ross, why, why, why? And it's not another planet, it's a multiverse/time machine thing. The aunt lives several lives as a dancer, warrior and whatnot, and sure, again the message is powerful but the episode goes nowhere except give random superpowers to a character for later use in covering plot holes.Episode 8: Bruce Campbell countryExcept without Bruce Campbell, so less fun - still, we move forward. Little girl gets cursed by magic cop (MCAB), Korean girl appears for 3 seconds, and a gory end sets the stageEpisode 9: Ku Klux Klan CountryThis is a very good episode in how it deals with the Tulsa massacre and characters' reactions to it. But, honestly, they need to go back in time to retrieve the book of names before it got lost/destroyed in the massacre. OK. Aunt now also knows how to fix and operate time machine and also is a cyborg for some reason (the 1950s time machine is technologically compatible with far future tech). Ok... So let's go back to the very same day of the massacre. WHY. You can go a couple of days earlier at the very least and steal the book. Won't make a difference. But no. We will go at the worst possible moment even though we can choose literally any point in time. Aunt becomes Storm from X-Men at the end.Episode 10: total randomness countrySpells that the show doesn't bother explaining (how they work, what they actually do), people having learned pronunciation, syntax and grammar of a dead language in 10 minutes, random help from ancestors at first but not later (why? because!), Leti falls to her death but doesn't die (because!), aunt knows how to construct a futuristic robot arm in half an hour with materials available at any 50s home, ghosts that bleed, spells that shouldn't work because we didn't get the ingredients but work anyway (BECAUSE!), forgetting to use time travel this time, the list of things that make no sense is endless. An atrocious episode."
289,"To be honest, I started this show without any expectation and it turned out great. The story starts slow, gives you the window to grasp and then builds up. The cast, acting everything blended thoroughly, leaving almost no scope to complain. Anyone in love with thriller, horror, mystery genre, you won't regret giving it a shot.
I am eagerly looking forward for the next episodes."
290,Great acting and great story. granted only 2 episodes in but cant wait to see which direction this show goes. recommended.
291,"This was one of the most anticipated shows, for me, this summer. I'm absolutely intrigued by the first episode and I can't wait to watch the rest. We need more black american narratives/stories!!!P.S.For the triggered white people...STAY MAD."
292,"Literally, one of the best HBO premiers in a decade. What a cast, dripping with talent and power. These review bombing trolls can't obscure the incredible and cinematic hour of television we just witnessed. Blown away."
293,Do not listen to the bad reviews cause those people don't know what a good show is.. so far LoveCraft County is a great show with many twists and turns!!'n
294,"Only could stand watching 2 episodes before I became bored and moved on to other things.
Just too slow for my taste I guess..."
295,"Didn't expect much of the series and was afraid of a lovecraft story made into a racial issue. But it was very good, the main characters are very likeable, the US 50's era with racial issues comes over strange for us Europeans but it adds another element of horror. And isn't being alienated with hostiles all around you apart of lovecraftian horror?"
296,"First episode has some pacing problems and is trying to be a little bit of everything.
Having read the novel I can say it follows it decently and I'm looking forward to how they will handle coming episodes.
The novel is quite episodical in its nature and the show may risk end up feeling a bit disjointed."
297,Don't listen to the trolls. Very simple. It's an epic HBO show and you'll be happy you gave it a chance
298,The show definitely had a lot going on but it's done in a great way. I find myself engaged and anxiously awaiting the next episode. To me it's gotten way better as it's gone on. Don't let the reviews from those stating it's a mess out you off. It requires a bit of attention to keep up with but it's more than worth it.
299,I seen this show on HBO channel for a few episodes. The actors were mediocre at best. Plot was boring. I hope HBO has better shows to offer because I am thinking of canceling This show is crap.
300,"The first episode drew me in and really created a world I wanted to know more about. The next few episodes took me out of it unfortunately due to its lackluster delivery. I am happy I came back to the show because episode 6,7,8 have been absolutely phenomenal and I will now add it to the list of one of my favorites shows. If you were let down by the first half of the season, keep watching, this show keeps getting better and better."
301,"Indiana Jones meets the supernatural 😎, I can't really think of any other way to describe it, you get something different from every episode so far."
302,"Some of The music , like Cardi b and stuff , are just cringe and dont fit The show at all"
303,"Still giving chances but.... Meeh. Clearly it's finely and beautifully crafted mess wtf show. still didn't understand what's going on. what line should I follow, It's like every episode is one stand alone movies. no any connections.
JJ Abrams and J Pele big disappointment."
304,Special effects and stories is good. mix of horror and drama
305,Another hit show. What an amazing pilot. Absolutely loved it. The racism is more scary than the monsters. Maybe that's the point. Certain demographic of people who refuse to face the huge problem of racism in America are going to hate it no doubt. But for rest of us this is amazing story telling touching upon subjects which are as relevant today as it was in 50's.Only downside? I can't binge watch the entire show.
306,"Great start for this show, Jurnee Smollet-Bell was amazing!"
307,"If the future episodes are like the first episode, this series will be considered a masterpiece. Amazing visuals with richly crafted protagonists. The acting is superb. That 5.3 rating is quite puzzling as the other two reviews left were 9 and above. In this time in which binging is the norm, the wait for the next Sunday's episode is worth it."
308,"***Spoilers***Sin Number One: Why change the name of the town to Ardham? In Lovecraft's stories the name of the town is Arkham, Mass. Why do something like that? I dislike writers who fiddle with established mythos. Sin Number two: Why is the series so Anti-White? That is just reverse racism which is just as bad as racism. Sin Number Three: It rides on the coat-tails of a great writer while having little to to with his established mythos and world that other writers have created.
Now other than these sins against Lovecraft, it is an okay and entertaining series in and of itself. HBO does need to get out of the rut they are in with all the diversity programming they are brainlessly shoving down their viewers throats. Let us simply say, been there done that, and move on to some other ideas."
309,"Seems the monsters have found this page and are chiming in.This show is excellent! The acting, the storyline-the writing, the setting, wardrobe, historical references, the suspense, thrill/horror, the sci-fi, the music, Tospy and Bopsy...omg! This show exhibits everything I want and expect when spending an hour of my precious time watching tv.
I didn't like the show at first because I had my own preconceived notion of what I was expecting to see. With every episode, however, the writers/actors proved me wrong and this show seems to be one of the few tv shows that will turn horror, scifi and historical fiction on its head. Not only that, I'm learning more horrors of the Jim Crow American history I never knew. Love the show! Need more like it."
310,"I attempted to watch the show into 5 episodes but it's too much. The show is all over the place with no direction in side... is it a horror, sci-fi, African American racisms, interracial relationships, gay relationships, magic, war... I'm left nauseous & confused :0~Very good acting lineup but just cannot waste any more time with this thing!"
311,"If you don't like the show you have little to no imagination to be honest. I've been seeing these negative reviews about people not understanding what this show is about. If you can't get it then you will never get it, it's simple as that. there is tons of references and plus you have to get the nuance. If you can't get past that, then maybe it's not the show's plot that you have a problem with. You gotta think outside the box for this one and if you can't handle that then it's not for you now is it."
312,"Wonderful and diverse stories
Keeping things interesting"
313,"I am loving this show. It has action,thrills,romance and some comedy but not to much which is good. The actors and actresses are well played and perfect for their roles. Looking forward to more episodes."
314,I love it already and see it getting so so much better!! The cast is perfect!!
315,"This series is amazing. This scifi horror plus spot on racial accuracy is refreshing during this time. Add today's pandemic, racial disparities, and race to the White House, one must wonder and admire God's timing. I absolutely love it and the Easter eggs are off the chain. It's refreshing to see amazing artistry, I can't wait for episode 5."
316,"This show has an amazing cast, story, soundtrack, and commentary. I haven't had this much fun since the earlier seasons of Lost - and it's actually more fun, but also relevant and outrageous at the same time. I usually pride myself on being able to guess what comes next - I can't here - and I love that! Also love IMDB and never wrote a comment until now - worth it!"
317,"I had to watch Lovecraft Country after seeing the trailers and yes its horror which I don't usually go for. After the first episode I'm hooked cause its not just about Atticus finding his past (what all black people would like to do), its about a super intelligent group of book reading, history loving, cool black geeks who are fighting supernatural monsters and the horrors of real life racism. This is so unique and wonderful. Can't wait for the rest of the episodes."
318,"Amazing so far through the first seven episodes. I did not think anything could give Watchmen a run for its money on mixing the sci fi genre of masked super hero lore with the horrors of racial injustice, but man oh man if Lovecraft and Jordan Peele as executive producer just upped the game ten fold and made Watchmen's powerful season seem tentative by comparison.Now we have the horror genre and the ""literal horrors"" of racial terror turned on its head in a way i have never seen. Every episode has been outstanding so and you can tell all the wonderfully talented actors involved are feeling every moment of the terror their characters face on a day in day out basis. The music is brilliant and timely throughout each episode. Even with the running from literal, screeching monsters, every moment where they get a chance to be normal is interrupted by the constant drumbeat of white terror and oppression. It is exhausting and makes your blood boil, but every moment you are rooting for them as they survive a new horror each week in unexpected ways, but also absorb heart breaking loss.This could not be more timely to remind us how dangerous racism is and that human monsters are the worst kind of monster you will ever face. Bravo!"
319,It's a bit fast paced so you have to pay attention to details. I've enjoyed all 4 episodes so far
320,"I've watched the 1st 3 episodes 3 times and the 4th twice so far. The casting is PERFECT! I'm loving the mix of true crime story (yes these things happened LOOK THEM UP!), horror, family and adventure! Excited for the rest of the season!"
321,"I just want to say that I usually do not like watching movies/tv shows that showcase what my grandfathers and grandmothers went through. It just hurts and it makes me angry, however this show kept me in tune. I was furious at what they were going through that I just wanted to be there and help. This show is so good. My review is all of the place but just watch it. Especially if you're like me, an African American person."
322,"The acting and writing is superb! The imagery is amazing! Even though the time period is during the Jim Crow era, a lot of it still resonates with today. I also love how it depicts Black people as people and not with the usual stereotypes."
323,"Plot/subplots are not as hard to follow as users with low reviews suggest - just get off your phone and pay attention. The cinematography of the show is beautiful - as is the set/costume design. There is a mix of modern music with an awesome score that's straight out of 50's mystery and adventure radio shows. Finally, the acting is flawless - it's both believable and dramatic (like intended).Watching this show, I can imagine this is what people felt when they listened to a weekly radio show in the 50's. Being that each episode is directed by a different director, it makes for an exciting, fresh look every week.Now, this show is great but it isn't perfect. For one, it can be predictable at times but doing anything unique is hard in modern times. Similarly, there are many Jordan Peele tropes at play which means there will be a lot of social commentary. This is not a bad thing but it can become distasteful when overdone (hence the word trope) - it's more in some episodes than others. Sometimes a mystical monster is scarier than oppression and vise versa. Hopefully the directors will adjust the overuse of Peele tropes, but I assume Peele is pretty hands on. This is fine with me, but apparently others are still sensitive to seeing a white villain (even set in the early 50's). I really like the show and hope the producers/directors can come together to create something that lasts another season (or more).Score 8.2 (rated 9 to compensate for baseless 1 ratings)"
324,"Has a real Jordan Peele feel, in the best way: Black experience filtered through horror conventions and drawing on black culture, high (Baldwin) and low (Afrofuturism). And thrilling and creepy as hell, making well-manicured (scenic) agricultural areas seem ominous and scary-white In a way even a suburban white guy like me can feel. The definition of the uncanny, racialized."
325,"Everything about this production is on point. Set production, wardrobe. Music. The action and effects are top notch. The cast is amazing and you feel the tension, fear and frustration. If your genre stan is science fiction, horror, drama, this has all of it. HBO got me again. I'm hooked."
326,I'm only second episode in and cannot get enough. I love a bit of mystery especially of the Fantasy nature. I can't wait to see where this goes.
327,"A really solid first episode, an intriguing mystery and some edge of your tension. I loved every bit of this and can't wait for more."
328,Good first episode. It was intense. At times uncomfortable to watch because - despite being a horror/supernatural shows - it draws from the reality of those times (and I don't mean the horror aspect). I can see why a certain demographic might be upset and started an artificially depressed campaign. We saw who the real monsters were in the first episode.
329,"The mark of a good horror story is characters you care about. By the end of the first episode you fall in love with Tic, Liti, and Uncle Freeman!"
330,"Unique, interesting and worthwhile. Lovecraft country is off to a great start, haven't seen a show in quite some time where Im eagerly awaiting the next episode with little to know idea of what will happen. The acting is great, the characters are well written and likable, you genuinely care what happens to them. The genre I'd use to describe LC is Adventure/Horror, and it is refreshing to see them mesh together so well."
331,To Glorify the fantasy of H.P. Lovecraft and ignore the reality that he was an extreme racists is exactly why this series exists. The show thus far mixes in the reality of what H.P. Lovecraft believed in with his fantasy of creating monsters and science fiction when the very thing he practiced and believed in was an actual horror itself.The show doesn't skip out on the reality of what pre civil rights America was like for non whites. The true monsters that hunted and killed people at the time were those that practiced and supported racism. Then add in the irony of the fictional HP Lovecraft monsters and they seem rather tame to what people of color actually had to endure in those times.I'd say that this isn't going to be a show for everyone. More or less just not for people that have the mindset of seeing nothing wrong with the racism but would rather complain about the series not being Lovecraft enough.Oh it is very Lovecraft just not the side of him he wrote about in his books.
332,"What a great first episode!
Don't mind this 5 stars reviews, my bet is that they don't even watched the show!Judging by the first episode the show have great potencial, and I look foward to the next 9!Enjoy!"
333,"I feel like this show is a hit or miss with each episode.Episode 1 showed some promise with interesting elements of horror, mystery and race. Episode 2 was a complete nose dive, so much random exposition and lore from all different angles that really didn't mean anything and was just confusing. Episode 3 was probably my favorite in terms of horror, mystery and character development. It set the tone of what the entirety of the series should be. But again, as the series progresses we're thrown a bunch of lore and exposition that doesn't hold much weight. The pace at times is either way too slow or fast. Episode 6 serving a backstory filler was completely different in tone, yet I really enjoyed it as it had the perfect mix of horror, mystery, lore and character development. After that one episode I really cared for a brand new character, more than some that have been featured in the series since episode 1. Episode 7 was okay until the acid trip of a plotline kicked in.The soundtrack is decent, but jarring at times when the songs don't match the time period.Overall, the series feels disjointed and isn't sure where to go and when at times. I'll still continue to watch because of some interesting and complex characters, decent script, and good horror and mystery elements (sometimes). It needs to find its' footing and decide what its' main focus is going to be in regards to plot, because right now it's a bit all over the place."
334,"Today, I learned that the book that this is based on, which is marketed as ""exploring the conjunction of H.P. Lovecraft and racism in the United States during the era of Jim Crow laws"" is, according to other reviews here on IMDB, not supposed to be inspired by Lovecraft's stories. It has otherworldly monsters, secret cults, and names that are strikingly similar to those used by Lovecraft. It even makes direct in-world references to Lovecraft's stories. But, despite all this, and despite the title, I'm assured by numerous other reviewers that it was never intended to relate to Lovecraft and his darker themes whatsoever. While I find this hard to believe, I still think the show, even as a stand-alone horror is merely ""okay"". The reason I give it an overall 7 is because of the acting, and because it is entertaining if you're looking for something along the lines of Dan Brown and Indiana Jones. It's not particularly deep, and if you have any passing interest in supernatural fiction from the early 20th century, the only thing new are the protagonists. That part is refreshing; I just wish the characters had been given a better story to explore. Some real darkness would have given them a chance to show us what they can do. This isn't cosmic horror. It's barely horror. It's adventure, and if the original author didn't want us to associate it with the Lovecraft name, perhaps a better title would have fit his novel."
335,Unfortunately the rest of the show treats you like you are stupid or had a mind wipe between every episode. Also it has some homophobic undertones.
336,"Love the series after the first episode! Dying to see where the later episodes go. Love that white America is being intoduced to the concept of a ""sundown town"". In fact that little injustice is the source for on of the most TENSE moments in that first hour. Also, I love LETI! Her sprint for her life puts all other witless horror inginues to shame! Looking forward to many more scares and lore!"
337,Good production and actors but episodes don't seem clear enough to be satisfied at the end. Black Mirror has set a high bar that Lovecraft Country hasn't reach.
338,"There is some decent horror/sci fi elements here, but ultimately it suffers from an out of place focus on race relations. Nearly every white character is overtly vilified and two dimensional, it just feels like lazy writing. I get that it's the 50s and racism was prevalent, but I came to watch some cool and creepy storylines, not poorly done social commentary. The first episode was awesome but subsequent ones get bogged down by the aforementioned focus on race.Get Out was great because the white characters were disturbing and subtle, but the antagonists in Lovecraft Country are like cartoon villains in comparison. The storyline throughout the episodes is weirdly disjointed as well, and the only character I really cared about was Montrose, who has a more interesting storyline later on. Some good era-appropriate music, although I wish they would've included a bit more jazz. Definitely could have done without the Cardi B!The interesting thing is the episodes almost follow a steady decline in quality with episode 1 being excellent and episode 7 being hot garbage (sweet afro though!).Oct 6 edit: Ok episode 8 is back on track, dancing girls were ultra creepy and end was epic. I'll wait until episode 10 for a final review."
339,"I guess I was spoiled with Watchmen and hoping Lovecraft would be of the same quality but I was disappointed. I don't know where to begin with what's wrong with this show. First and foremost, there's so much going on it's unclear what it all means. It's uneven; lacks a consistency with each episode and written like it's a separate series. There's bizarre and then there's just nutty. This is nutty and keeps going nowhere."
340,Absolutely amazing! This show will have you on the edge of your seat. The third act is phenomenal. I'm hooked. The police are even scarier than the monsters. Jurnee is such a great actress and does a great Letitia. Probably the top new tv show of the year.
341,I desperately want things to be excited about and look forward to with everything else going on and this show checked all my boxes!
342,"Could have been great, not great at all, yet. Still it is not fair to judge just right after the first episode, but so far it was a big disappointment for me. Not even close to being Lovecraftian, it was pure boredome, the characters are not so exciting (yet), the atmosphere is nothing special and the CGI is quite terrible. No tension, no horror, nothing but poorly made gore unfortunately. Also a touch of currenty trendy BLM propaganda, but not that bothering I guess (yet). Still I'll give it one more shot to see where it heads, really hoping it'll get better."
343,"The layers, the depiction of segregated America, the horror (both human and supernatural, the performances, and how the show spins so many tropes of horror while making us reflect about Lovecraft's writings and his racism make this show a MUST watch."
344,"Bit of a comedy spoof (i hope). Got potential, appears to be on the lines of Sabrina and Buffy."
345,This show is the best it sheds a lot of light on African Americans past history that continues today in 2020 some of the same acts African American face every day that are being swept under the rug as for the magic part in loving every bit of it it plays a lot on your mind an thoughts but I'm like this hands down the show is amazing amazing actors I just love William really honestly everyone pls give us several more season because it's a big GAME CHANGER.
346,"I don't understand the negative reviews for this show. I gave it a 9 at first but changed to 10 after watching a few more episodes. It really is u folding nicely.Better yet, I don't understand how people can not get addicted to this show! I've watched each episode (4 so far (CURSE you HBO for not binge dropping!!)) about 10 times each and every single time I see a new piece of the puzzle that I missed the first time! For instance, 1st episode - Atticus says he gets a letter from his dad explaining his family history, and the first time I never noticed the look on George's face but after episode 2, rewatch it and things start clicking. It is crazy how they just drop that stuff in so subtle but it makes a huge impact down the road.Next, how can people say the acting is so so?!?! Have we been watching the same show? I mean seriously, episode 3, the emotional pain that Journee Smollett shows is heartbreaking so much so I know what's going to happen and it still makes me cry every time I see her pleading for help from the spirts and when they come together and become whole, is just amazing especially when you see what was done to them. FYI - that baby head did not just come from nowhere - I think the lady with her breast and arm cut off, when you see her start to regenerate you will see her cradling a baby when her arm reappears and then you see her pregnant so you know they cut the baby out of her, ugh so sad. Like I said, once you Start to rewatch these episodes, you'll see the little things that make so much sense, like Epstein's arm is missing when he confronts Lettie and next episode you know why! Point being, if you can't get lost in the moment then your not watching the show, you are really feeling what these people are going through.It's true it is following the book with alterations but it's for a reason - some things just do not translate from print to movie so the changes made from book to show, I approve of so far.Each character has pain and depth and the onion layer gets peeled back every episode!Honestly give this show a chance and sometimes the gruesome horror that these people are complaining about this is show lacking, which it isn't, is quite honestly because they missed the point on the implied horror that humanity contains. Quite honestly seeing the human monsters for what they are and how much much hate, rage, and the enjoyment of torture they can afflict on another person and to justify is just plain terrifying. Sad thing is if those reviewers can't see that, be afraid of them because that is just a clear view insight into these peoples minds...yikes!I like it, I hope the season ends strong and they can extend this for another season and if anything please just give it a chance and think for yourself and above all else remember even though this is a show, all aspects of what they are saying is based on an element of truth so once that sinks in that will get your brain reeling!"
347,"Lovecraft Country is a compelling sci-fi, adventure, fantasy, horror, and historical fiction all rolled into one. There are references to African American history & art seamlessly woven throughout each tale. The writers give a nod to the ""literary cannon"", yet challenges its ideologies and spits in the face of the white supremacy that permeates many works/authors of it. Watch the show, read the book, listen to the podcast, and start reading the novels referenced. You'll see influences from Baldwin to The Odyssey. Simply beautiful."
348,"I was really looking forward to this show, but after two episodes I feel let down. Maybe, I will feel differently as the series progresses.The biggest problem, for me, is the pacing. At first it feels too slow- then it's too much, too fast. I find myself losing interest at both speeds for different reasons.The CGI is really terrible, so bad it's distracting. It's possible this was a deliberate choice, because the real ""monsters"" in this show are the white folks. The monsters are a work of fiction (bad special effects convey this), what we really need to fear are the humans. If true, it is a clever choice- but clever isn't always entertaining.I find no issue with a story portraying white people as villains (hey, if the shoe fits...). If nothing else it's equal opportunity- historically Black folks have been portrayed as villains in TV, disproportionately. I find some of these reviews laughable- and I'm white."
349,Fantastic start - can't wait for the rest of the season!
350,"My review is based only on first 2 episodes. Started off really slow, but my god when it got going, it really got going.
Loved 2nd episode too, can't wait to see where its going.
Don't let the bad reviews put you off, Its a fine good show, so far."
351,"To all the folk complaining about this show not being ""Lovecraft-enough"", do you not realize it's based on a book, in turn, based on the characters, having, in turn, read Lovecraft? That's kind of the point. The horrors of being a black person in the Jim Crow south almost outweighs any kind of flying monsters in some esoteric setting. But we get both! I've only watched the first episode so far, but am definitely enjoying what I'm seeing."
352,How dare they depict what times were like back then. How dare they give a solid drama with a mix of action and horror. How dare they make such beautiful sets and capture the cultures and environment of a very dark time in America's history. If you want to pretend that segregation never happened and that people of color were treated so differently back then. Then don't watch this show. If you want to open your mind and accept a dose of some sad reality with a mix of fantasy the check it out. You won't be disappointed.
353,"The acting is good, but it's tediously slow and when the action starts, it's CGI laden and unfortunately not good CGI.Pretty poor premiere."
354,Combining lovecraft with racial conflict should've provided infinite opportunities to create a good show. yet the creator of this show and the cast failed to do so.
355,"The one who kills a dragon becomes a dragon himself. If the authors wanted to show it, then in series 10 they were able to do it. As a result, the daughter of Hippolyta became a real monster and the embodiment of evil."
356,"As the name implies this is inspired by H. P. Lovecraft's Universe and also being based on a book in it's own right also named Lovecraft Country.This is a pretty amazing series, with crosses between magic and science and blends them together without breaking its own universe. The story follows a african american family called The Freemans in the 1950s and how there is a great history and destiny for the Family. Because of the setting it deals a lot with racial tension and segregation of the time and also has fun sci-fi monster of the week episodes to break up the tensions of the show.The special effects and make-up are all top notch like most HBOs TV show a lot of time and money has been put into this show.Definitely well worth the watch and I'm interested in where Season 2 will take us."
357,"This is one of, if not THE most disgusting show I have ever seen!, I tried to keep watching to see if it got better, it only got worse!! I am embarrassed for Smollett, and Michael K Williams to be part of such a gory, creepy mess!!
Cortney B Vance was lucky
he got killed off before it truly went off the rails, the writers and creators of this
XXX rated horror, truly need professional help!
To be able to write such
trash, out of the blue, one has to be clinically INSANE!!"
358,The show consist mainly of two parts that feel at times complete disconnected from each other. Mystical horror and struggle of black people in 1950s USA.While I wouldn't have minded having some part of the show display the hardships of being black it seems to dominate over the fantasy part of the show. Dragged out sections of drama kept losing my attention. The show starts with a lot of fantasy and mystery but soon turns into 1950s drama accompanied by a bit of fantasy.Overall the show has good actors and interesting themes but to me the themes feel off balance.
359,I love the cast and fresh actors. Great depiction of a great novel producers and directors did an excellent job!
360,"First thing first, this series is based on a novel of the same name, which I had no idea of going in. I thought this was an original work going in, that would deal with both racism inherent to Lovecraft and the legacy of the area in which the stories come from. It very much is not.If you are going into this series blind, its probably best to ignore the ""Lovecraft"" part of the title in your mind.With that out of the way, this series is messy and inconsistent, with a feeling of ""throw it at the wall, see what sticks"" to it. I have just finished watching episode 6, which is nearly completely divorced from the rest of the series thus far, and calls into question some actions of the... protagonist(?!) of the story.Jonathan Majors is a major disappointment as well, with Mr. Majors seemingly knowing only one acting technique: grimacing and scrunching up his face. I wish I had anything positive to say about him, but both the character he plays, and the actor himself, do a poor job of acting real. After the 90th time per episode you see him making the same face, I hope you wont be as tired of it as I.The other characters get a little story to them, but they fall a bit flat overall. They also feel a bit out of character for the time period in which they exist.The earlier entries in the story have been filled with a lot of 'white guilt', which was starting to become tiresome. Fortunately and unfortunately, this changed in the most recent episode, which focuses on the Korean War.Overall the story feels meandering and pointless thus far, with few real concrete goals, and those it does have are rendered pointless when the plot just decides its time to wrap it up. Note that I said the plot makes these decisions, not the characters. Many things are so contrived, it feels like boredom more than desire to write something compelling is what drives things in the show.This being an HBO show, it looks great. The soundtrack is a bit all over the place, with things like old school jazz bumping heads with modern songs, and not in a complementary way. The CGI isnt the best, oddly, but works well enough to not totally take you out of the story.If you were hoping for something that actually feels like it is connected to Lovecraft, this isnt it. If you want something that touches on both racism and monster horror or just something new in general, give it a go.This is most definitely NOT the next GOT or Sopranos."
361,I like this show but not like Raised by wolves. The diffrence is just hbo and hbl max
362,"I've never heard of Lovecraftian horror, Matt Ruff or the other author reviewers are complaining about. Im viewing this TV show with no expectations or preconceptions of how I think this show should be. That said. I love this series. Yes episode 1 was a bit slow however I feel it did justice in allowing us to the and feel the backdrop these characters are placed in or coming from. It gives dept to the show. After episode 1 things started to happen creepily and nicely paced. I cant wait to see the next episodes."
363,"This show is great. I'm seeing a lot of low ratings, and people being triggered by the show. Someone even said ""this is the most racist show on TV"" - I chuckled.For those of you who are triggered by this show, and those who feel uncomfortable watching it, you might want to search your heart why you feel the way you feel. That's all I'm going to say.As far as the show itself is concerned, this is one of the best I have seen."
364,"Really tried to get into this, but had a hard time following the story. Maybe it was just me but I was looking for more after a friend referred this to me. Not my taste."
365,"The story is good, acting is really good. hilarious how everyone is calling the depiction of whites ""racist"" when in fact they were probably a lot worse than they're portrayed here"
366,"Lovecraft Country has the flavor of Watchmen, Get Out!, X-files, and the Twilight Zone. Like those series, it is subversive - covering emotionally challenging history in a sauce you just can't stop eating. The cinematography and acting are top rate! Of course, if you don't appreciate your history & current events served up fantasy/sci-fi/horror style, then you're in the wrong restaurant - the Documentary Diner is three doors down and Fox ""News"" Is on the other side of town.Me: I'll be back for a second helping."
367,Not at all impressed. Certainly NOT the Lovecraft I know and love. Next...
368,This was not what I was expecting from the show. I didn't really pay attention to the trailer so I thought it was just another one of those boring drama period pieces.I was pleasantly surprised after watching the first episode though! Its exciting AND explores a dark side of american history and racism. Fusing it with fantasy and mystery/exploration elements.Truely a unique show in the making and looking forward to see how the first season develops. This reminds me of how I felt when watching trueblood for the first time!
369,"Segregation, horror, thrill. And they are combined with each other in a very beautiful way. The first episode is an epic pilot for a series , which anyone who watches it will enjoy in some way. It is a well crafted jordan peel/J. J Abrams combination, with layers upon layers of secrets and hidden meanings . As a horror , it sayisfies most horror loving audience, but with just one look at it, you can see the series is more than that. Real refrences to segregation related behaviour and events, even in the background , says alot about how to approay the series.you can enjoy a well crafted story, with great visual effects and acting , altogether to make the series one of the best series of the year"
370,"Episode 1 had me hooked and I loved it but one main character's development is becoming more and more unlikeable it's putting me off. I love Atticus' character and the actor really understands and portrays his character so well. The same can be said for Montrose and I sincerely believe that my inability to decide if he is a villain or his actions are with good intentions make him so interesting. But is Leti (Letitia) meant to be so arrogant, reckless and selfish? In an effort to be seen as confident and independent has she mistakenly ended up being self serving and extremely unlikable? I see a big difference between an admirable female (wonder woman) and Leti. I hope her character develops better with coming episodes because this series has so much potential to be as amazing as it was in episode 1"
371,"I love this show! The concept and story is amazing! The acting is great and the cast is perfect! I am addicted! Waiting each week for episode is torture!
This is definitely a show to not miss!
If there are negative reviews then I can only imagine it's from folks who didn't watch it. It's too damn good to garner genuine negativity."
372,"I'm not into scary shows. But, I just can't get enough of this show.The twist, the turns it's so intense. The writing is truly amazing and the acting is GREAT!! I'm in love with each and every character on this show. I went out and purchased the book too. Also picked of The Ballad of Black Tom. I might just be into black horror films....Who knew!! Hahaha"
373,This is one of the best shows I've watched in a long time!
374,"Really can't understand all the negative reviews, i think it is one of the best things i have watched for years. Love the characters and i think that all the negative comments are simply from people who have not got anything better to do than try to appear like they are some sort of film critic. Ignore the plebs, just enjoy."
375,Great show. I love the flashbacks. The story keeps unraveling and gets more interesting every show. Every episode keeps you wanting more
376,"Misha Green has outdone herself with the writing and directing of this HBO series. Rarely do we see black people portrayed in action/drama/horror (without dying)/ and sci-fi without them being a sidekick to a non-POC. The timeline of this show is set in the 1950's when segregation and outright, in your face racism was thriving. You definitely get all of that in this show. There are no white saviors in the book... or in this show. Thank goodness!"
377,"Episode 1 was interesting with all of the terrible police and downright evil personification of 1950's White people. The pace was good with nonstop action and/or entertaining events. The part of episode one where they had a 10 minute outdoor concert take place and they show played the ENTIRE act...all ten minutes of it! If I wanted to watch music acts on tv I go to MTV or whatever it's called now. It was way too much and I almost turned off the show due to it dragging out too long. Fortunately after that the show picked up just fine.The acting was good with the female lead commanding most of the show. Atticus is an interesting character also. I feel as though they have gone way overboard on the race war thing, and it quite literally has been made into a war on this show and I feel it detracts from the plot because all of a sudden this show is all about race war and not Lovecraftian cosmic horror. In a nutshell episode 1 is great minus the issue noted above.Episode 2 is where it starts to go bad. I can go along with everything in the show up until the last 20 minutes of the show where right when the climax of the two episode arc is about to take place by opening a portal to Eden, another musical interlude takes place, just like in episode 1 ! Not only can the viewer not really hear the conversations, chanting and general witchcraft taking place, but the song itself is pretty much an F.U. to caucasiens. It's shocking enough that it draws the viewers attention away from the show climax that is supposed to be taking place! Terrible. As a result the viewer is scratching their head asking there self ""What TF is going on""?It was from this point onwards that the show goes downhill fast. Episode 3 and 4 are unfortunately coming up short. If only the show could have kept some of that episode one magic mix of Lovecraft horror, tense dramatic experiences and more depth on the Lovecraft lore that really needs to be explored quite badly!5/10 on this show based on the first four episodes. Maybe it can change for the better? I doubt we will ever get to see a season 2 on the air, unless things change fast!"
378,"This is a solid show. The negative reviews are expected. This show is well acted, has good music and has an interesting setting. The show is set in 1950's USA where the main characters face racial discrimination with Jim Crow and segregation happening along with experiencing the terrifying monsters of HP Lovecrafts writing. It's a very interesting idea and I'm excited to see where it goes. Some of the negative reviews brand this show as bad because it's ""anti white"" which is laughable due to the fact that it's obviously not anti white but pro black. Huge difference there and says a lot about the person who labels it anti white.
This was a similar problem with the HBO Watchmen series, which eventually garnered a lot of positive feedback as time went on. My advice would be to make it through a few episodes of Lovecraft before making any final judgments. Something to note is that this isn't based on any specific Lovecraft story but uses a culmination of his ideas to create the world within. A lot like the Castle Rock series. Anyway give it a go if it interests you"
379,"The setting, the magic, the monsters. All the acting feels top-shelf. The sound tracks. It all adds to one heck of a ride for me!"
380,"This show is a fantastic reimagining of Lovecraft. The performances are outstanding, the plots are bonkers and fun, but still meaningful like the best of horror and sci-fi. The score and sound design are stellar. If you loved HBO's Watchmen, you're gonna love this, too. It don't see the horror of racism in America, then you might skip this and watch DW Griffith or something."
381,"Another social drama about the complexes of African-americans with a minimum of plot. It is extremely boring to watch the development of the characters.
The main action begins at about 55 minutes of the first episode. I'm not sure I can handle the second. Nothing to do with Lafcraft."
382,"If u want to have fun and explore the the Cuthulu mythos, this show is unfortunately a disappointment. This show is nothing like other good Lovecraftian themed movies, such as The Thing, The Color Out Of Space, The Mist, From Beyond or Reanimator. There is a lot of name dropping. Mentions of Lovecraft himself, Arkham, Shoggoths and other Cuthulu mythos writers. These mentions have led to nothing visually substantial. Basically the creatures called Shoggoths are not what is described by the Cuthulu mythos writers. Instead, you have a big mole/rat with a lot of eyes that is vulnerable to sun lite, that the characters relate to Bram Stocker's vampires. In the end it is entertaining enough to watch and the acting is pretty good. The CGI is not the best, and Lovecraftian monsters should never rely on just pure CGI, which the monsters in this show do. Expecting Lovecraftian themes will have a negative impact on your view of Lovecraft Country. So go in without thoughts of Lovecraft. To late for me."
383,"This show is shining a beaming light on all the injustice Black people have dealt with in the most creative way I have ever seen. If this show makes you uncomfortable as a white person then shame on you, you can look back in history and see things way worse than what is being portrayed on this show. To the actors/actresses, writers, directors and everyone involved JOB WELL DONE & KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!"
384,"I love EVERYTHING about this show! It has representation, real historical facts added in, and all the creepiness of your favorite horror film."
385,"This show is easily one of my favorite of 2020. Each episode is packed with suspense and manages to feature a well-contained story that folds nicely into the overarching plot. I also love the many historical Easter eggs that pay homage to African American history: from a young Emmett Till's fate being forecasted by the Ouija board, to the Greenbook guide, to the Tulsa bombing reference-so many important cultural references. The acting is also superb."
386,Love this show! Each episode has so much histirical information that you can miss if you didn't know any better.
387,"Which made the show fantastic to watch... I can't wait to watch episode 2 after the horrorlific final twenty mins of the first episode , it took a little while to get going but I was never bored once , the lead female and male I'm not totally familiar with however they are brilliant and perfect for what it is to come. HBO new horror series is perfectly timed and perfectly executed"
388,"I'm just going to say this and leave it at that.
I've watched the first episode of this superbly acted brilliantly written joy ride of a show four times straight and will probably watch it at least once more before the next episode airs,thats how good it is."
389,"It's just exactly what I needed
Keep going with the show"
390,"I do not know much about Cathulu and Lovecraft, so did not know what to expect. I enjoyed it a lot! It was keeping the suspense very well. Plot is great and progresses dynamically. If you enjoyed the new Watchmen you will enjoy this as it is made in a similar style."
391,"I don't understand how some people are rating the ""series"" when we only got the first episode? Is there somewhere I can binge all episodes because if so is d I'd love to.Anywho, the first episode I think was pretty solid. At first the start of the episode threw me for a loop and I was wondering what the heck am I watching but then it became normal (in a good way). Acting 10/10, script 7/10 but plenty of room for improvement, SFX 9/10. And for me the mood was 10/10. I don't want to give anything away; I would say if you're not a fan of settings being Jim Crow America then you may not like this. I personally don't like movies settled around this time because it just reminds me how awful people can be but So far the show is more than its setting.I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews and I don't know why the series gets bad reviews when we haven't seen all the episodes yet but it's whatever. You should give it a try and find out for yourself."
392,"Numerous people have done reviews complaining that the series just adopted Lovecraft in the title to cash in on the name. Such people are clearly unaware of the fact that the series is based on a 400 page novel, 'Lovecraft Country', which was published in 2016. So ignore those reviews. Secondly, some of the negative reviewers are based on political bias, and not on the merits, or lack of, of the series. Why should you watch it? Well, because it's great entertainment. It's an HBO production, so you know from the start that it's going to be quality. The only thing you need to question is whether or not you enjoy the storyline, the acting and the direction. I thought all 3 were executed admirably and after one episode I'm hooked."
393,"If you like horror and history this series is for you!The cinematography, set design, and the set wardrobe are all beautiful.The story lines are thought-out. You will scream and anticipate what's next. You will re-watch the episodes for ""what did I miss"" questions in your head.
And in the mist of all of this wonderful Hollywood production you will learn historical events that traumatized the Jim Crow Era African American community."
394,"This show is absolutely amazing with the combinations of sci-fi, black history, drama, and action. Its a hit on all levels for me. Great job to Misha Green and Jordan Peele!!"
395,"It's and educational fun ride wrapped in a house of horrors. I enjoy this show immensely! I'm engaged with all the characters, the writing is next level amazing, AND its given me the creeps on more than one occasion. FANTASTIC!!!"
396,It's a show that exposes a lot of deep things many won't address. I enjoy the fact that it is showing humanity and our faults in a time of discord. It's history with a sci fi thriller twist. Unlike a show I've ever seen before I hope it continues on for more seasons.
397,"If you love horror and sci-fi, this is for you. Each episode has surprises and a little history. It's best watched all episodes back to back. As I rewatched I found things I missed the first time."
398,"This show has a lot of fantasy things in it! From the characters, the acting, the effects, ALL OF IT IS AMAZING!! I haven't seen anything quite like this since Stranger Things. But I am definitely in love with this show. I hope it continues to go on with more seasons & also win many awards! It will be well deserved! GREAT JOB!!"
399,"This series took me to another place which is something most of these shows haven't done. When episodes have you so absorbed that you have to research and finding interest in the things that you're reading and comprehending then have you wondering why no one has either spoken about it or got deeper into the stories of racism that took place and IS STILL taking place.. MANNN!! No its not like the orignal LoveCraft book(s) but Matt Ruff's edition with some changes makes it all the more reason to want to start researching. Seeing the literary genius, the fact that they are flashing back to actual historical incidents, and the abhorrently ACCURATE portrayal of the times actual events that happened has me in awe! The narrative around black artistry and how black and brown people are represented in different genres of film is extraordinary. If you don't like it or understand it then don't watch it but don't put it down bc you don't understand it. Try researching, try understanding what's going on bc if you're not trying to understand what THIS history is teaching than you're losing out on some real knowledge."
400,"Made it through the fourth episode, but I don't think I'll be going any further with this show.Lovecraft Country is a show that attempts to be too much at the same time, and consequently falls flat in several areas. We start out getting a compelling, if a little pointed, look at Jim Crow America through the eyes of a black family from Chicago. The characters are interesting, the dialogue well written and the acting is above a standard HBO show. The show also does an admirable job transitioning into a slow building story about a mystery inheritance that has all the trappings of good Lovecraft.Then suddenly and without warning everything goes down hill. The slow pacing, atmosphere and drama is replaced with cheap CGI monsters and nonsensical plot lines that will seriously strain your ability to suspend disbelief. While there is an overarching narrative that loosely tries to tie the episodes together, we find ourselves watching a drama in one episode, a tacky monster horror flick the next, a half-decent ghost story the third and a weird Indiana Jones meets National Treasure clone in the fourth.The constant genre hopping left me both confused and wishing that they had stuck to a more consistent approach.I should note that I have no problem that they're taking liberties with Lovecraft's universe, and no issue with the political side of the show. In fact those parts are probably where it is strongest."
401,"If you are a fan of classic horror movies, period pieces from the 50's and great acting, please watch this show. The trolls are working full time. Don't belive the negative reviews. This a one of the best series of the summer."
402,"What a fantastic adaptation, it's like someone has brought a game of cthulhu to the big screen well done"
403,"A great, uncomfortable watch. So excited about this show!"
404,"Enjoyed the entirety of the premiere. Main characters are well-developed, performed, and written. Can definitely be an intense watch in some scenes but steadily develops into a supernatural story that makes me excited for the future episodes."
405,The tension of a Black family dealing with the fear and pain of living in a segregated America had my heart in my throat even before the monsters showed up. I needed a few new heroes to root for. Favorite new series of the summer. Loved it.
406,"Dont know anything about the books or source material. I also didn't know anything about it going in. I was pleasantly surprised that is a scary show. Scary in the way stranger things is scary. The acting, costumes, set, shots and generally everything about it is awsome. I can feel Jordan Peel's touch, that complicated more to the story. It creates anticipation for the story to come together! I did not feel like the race issues took over. I thought it was historically accurate for the time and also added to the scary suspense aspect."
407,... apparently only works one way in this production that alters Lovecraft's original vision.
408,Some of the best tv in a long while love it cant wait to see where it takes us
409,"The negative reviews of this show are abhorrent, and it is painfully obvious that they are intended solely to bring it down for nefarious reasons. The racism depicted in this show PALES in comparison to the true hideous visage of the 1950's Jim Crow era in America. This series is a love letter to every African American boy and girl that couldn't fit in anywhere in peace unless they had their nose in a comic book or dreaming up their adventures. The representation is brilliant! See this for yourself, and really see it for the artistic and thrilling ride that it is. Or just watch something else..."
410,"As I watch Lovecraft Country I'm taken by certain imagery like the characters searching for safe places to drive to in town, making sure they leave all southern towns before dark... Watching this movie brings back those thoughts to my mind of the past and the""present""... The mindset of certain viewers won't get it. I get it, I know it.. I understand it. Now, the story has flaws, not many, just some. But they're fixed as you watch it.. Deep thinking and watching are needed, so don't get up to make a snack. Get your snacks first then watch.. Hey... I didn't really put spoilers in this.. did I? Not really lol"
411,"The Sci-fi and horror genre could use more of this. Which/ who are the monsters really? What situations are more horrifying than those suffered in the real world? The first few episodes are disparate, but all part of the whole. I love this show as much as it disturbs me every episode!"
412,"Keeps you on the edge of your seat! The character detail is amazing, and the story line touches to many topics."
413,"Really enjoying this show, stylish, beautifully shot, great fashion and some real scary moments. On episode 8 and it gets better week."
414,"Now this will not be for everyone. For many reasons. First This show was released in a time where it will not be received well by some with what is happening in the real world politically/civilly and in others eyes it was released at the perfect time to showcase what we need to see (2020). Not only is this show a great science fiction shown by JJ Abrams production but also a no bars held look into the 1950s civil rights movement shown throw Jordan Peele's genius. That, put together in the mind of Misha Green and you have HBOs Lovecraft Country. If you have just 10 spare hours somewhere in your pandemic filled year give this show a shot. The acting, the music, there really isn't anything wrong with this show besides it's confusing. Confusing as hell. But confusing in the most beautifully puzzling ways. Now most people will dive into the reddit and spoilers to figure out what's going on but naturally it will and is till to unravel. But some of the craziest episodes ever witnessed and just head scratching scenes will make you come back Sunday to Sunday. Hopefully the last two episodes will be the ending we are all hoping for. Strap in and get ready it's time to head to Lovecraft Country."
415,"Typically I cannot bring myself to watch anything horror related, but this show is so well crafted that it sucks me in every time. Every episode is packed amazing cultural and historical easter eggs and gives me something else to research and learn. Each episode keeps you guessing about what will happening next. You'll root for the characters, get mad at them, yell at the tv and watch through your fingers LOL. It definitely will appeal to your inner history and science fiction nerd. There's not a weak actor on the show, Johnathan Majors, Jurnee Bell, Aunjanue Ellis, Courtney B Vance, Wunmi Mosaku, Jamie Chung and even little Jada Harris who plays Diana (Dee) Freeman are all captivating. Personal favorites include episodes 1, 6, and 7!"
416,This show touches on the ugly truth of American history with Sci fi and horror. It's a great hour of your time. The negative critics choose not to get it because maybe they resonate with the monsters.
417,Have to say 5 episode into this show kudos to the showrunners for taking risks and telling a wild compelling story. That plus a great cast and the best modern use of some of the lovecratian lore to date makes this a great watch.
418,I heard about this show and it took me a while to watch it.... But I love it... It's different and it's good!
419,Right up there with HBO's Watchmen. Great storytelling with a much needed voice.
420,Jordan Peele and HBO does it again. A great show so far. Thrilling and intense and this is even before the monsters show up ;). Highly Recommended!
421,"I am a huge fan of Lovecraft's works such as The Call of Cthulhu and The Colour Out of Space and many others. This show provides those aesthetics but not that kind of storytelling and world that his works are known for. Also this show is actually based on a novel written by a completely different author.The show is cool and fun at times but it does let itself down throughout and feels less of an actual Lovecraftian show and more of a traditional drama. Not to say the drama is bad the acting and writing is really well done, it's just that a show that has Lovecraft in the name should be more about the creatures and less about the characters.Overall it's worth a watch but it's not something worth talking about deeply in the long run."
422,"The series divided into independent subplots (intertwined), which have a few threads in common.What's great:
1. Jurnee Smollett's character
2. Nuanced take on ""racial segregation"" with a flavour of horrorWhat's bad:
1. The script (except for the pilot). The high production value tries to compensate for an uninteresting story-line but fails.
2. Fast-paced, compromising character development
3. Minimal essence of Lovecraft's horror
4. Distracting CGI in places
5. Not engaging enough
6. Too preachy sometimes"
423,"This show is amazing. There are a lot of reviews that are negative on here but let's face it- they are haters. We have here a show that we don't get to see nowadays. This isn't some Tyler Perry show. (no offense to Tyler) This is something new and fresh and different. Peoples comments seem like they wanted something predictable based on their own tastes but when something fresh comes they diss it. This show is amazing, great acting, interesting and new storyline, with history nicely woven in. We need more of this. More shows with black leads. More shows around black history or recreating the terrible history entirely to create a magical tale. We need this. 10/10. Wish it had more episodes - every episode feels like a little movie leaving you full and ready for the next one. Can't wait to see more."
424,"I'm probably half way through the first episode, and couldn't wait to write a review about this show that I've seen so many mixed reviews on.
1. It's set in the 1960's during Vietnam. There's a lot of segregation, even in big cities like Chicago, which were thought to be more progressive.
2. There's mystery and intrigue from the start. A man comes home from the war to search for his missing father, who leaves behind a cryptic note.
The main character is a sci-fi novel fan, the name of the show comes from a town often named in many HP Lovecraft's stories, referred to as Arkham.
3. The richness of detail, story, acting, character details, cinematography, and events remind me of something akin to Steven Spielberg. As a child of the 80's it reminds me a little of Amazing Stories.
4. If this had just been a story about white people in Lovecraft country, it wouldn't be nearly as interesting as the setting and circumstances that are being used.
5. The story centers around the importance of family for survival in the Jim Crow south. Despite our main characters being honorable, warm, loving people, they are treated like monsters and driven out of everyday places you and I might take for granted. On top of that, officers of the law seem to not only tolerate, but facilitate the discrimination.
During a time of civil unrest where the world is seeing the depths of the plight of black Americans in their fight to be treated as human beings, this is indeed a very apt and poignant story that is very relevant today.I have no doubt that Jordan Peele will be remembered as one of the most important writer/directors of our time because of the amount of thought and detail he pours into work like this, but also because this work really is the zeitgeist of the times. The actors really sell the characters and make you forget you're watching a show.Travel Safe"
425,"LOVING THIS SHOW, the acting is phenomenal and the settings/costumes are stunning. It's really awesome to see these stories being told in such a unique way."
426,"The three episodes are stunning, visual, plot and full of talented people"
427,"Beautiful, well written and I can't wait to see more! There are few tv shows that can hook me fully in the first episode but this is one of them."
428,"BUT... I was looking so forward to this and then WHAM!! there be monsters, very badly done monsters. I must admit I went into this blind. My son loves this kind of thing at age 35. I detest racism in all it's forms and just when I think I wont be able to handle this series, I get a face-full of monsters. That's when I know for sure I will only be watching this one episode. Sadly and disappointedly as I love the era, the clothes and styles but I despise the racism which, as a 65 year old white woman, I cannot even begin to comprehend and I know it was and is real. Love the Music from that time and the joy of community within the black area of Chicago. I might wait and watch the last episode to see if Tic finds his Father."
429,My husband and I really enjoyed the first episode. We are looking forward to seeing the remainder of season. Lovecraft is something different with its majority black actors. It's absolutely refreshing.
430,"I didn't know what to expect, and have been delighted. The African American perspective is refreshing, and the adventure element is great fun."
431,My husband and I LOVE this show! We look forward to it every Sunday!
432,"Not familiar with the book at alL... Watched this out of curiosity and loved it from episode 1! Each episode has a decent amount of suspense, and also keep you asking yourself questions. I look forward to the new episodes each week. Extremely well done, a definite W for HBO"
433,It's worth watching. the CGI is good. i neva got bored watching it. HBO is on fire
434,"I was very intrigued by the trailers of this show and they blew my expectations with the first episode! Epic cast ,great momentum and enough gore to satisfy the freaks ,I definitely will be tuned in for the rest of the season 😎"
435,Brilliant first episode. Great cast and acting so far.Sad to read that people are judging this based on colour!Cut us and we all bleed red. Get over it already its 2020 and stop living in the 1900s. The world is changing and I hope for the better.Really good story line here that takes some time to build but I really like where it's going.Watch it before reviewing!
436,"Normally, pilot episodes of new shows are slow, establish the main characters, and get to the meat and potatoes of the series. About the first half of the pilot episode of Lovecraft County was a bit slow, and the second half is ""WTF did I just watch?! O_OI have the first season set to record so I expect great things from this show."
437,I read the book a few months ago and loved it. The show is everything I hoped for. An excellent start!
438,"Visually stunning set design, strong acting, and a menagerie of compelling characters combine to create what couldbe HBO's next big thing.
Don't let the low score fool you just because there are fools who don't like being confronted with the sins of the past that still haunt us today. They tried it with Watchmen and it didn't work and it won't work here either."
439,Okay i gave it a 8 cause it takes awhile to get started but wow once it got started it really never quit alot of action alot going on here cant wait till sunday to do it all again the characters are fun and enjoyable actings great cant say much bad about it
440,Short and sweet this show is amazing!! Just watch it and it speaks for itself. Just gives you so much in one show. Don't listen to the bad reviews please
441,"I love the premise of the show. I've been waiting for a show like this since I started reading Lovecraft when I was a kid and I think if anyone's going to do it right it would be Jordan Peele. Plus, insanity-inducing monsters are a great (if not obvious) metaphor for racism in the US, so I really can't wait to see where Peele takes it after the first episode."
442,"I've never read the source material this show is based on (Lovecraft Country novels), but this show is a breath of fresh air. Love the cast, the mystery, the visuals the music and symbolism. Makes anticipate every next episode."
443,"There is so much to love in this beautiful genre breaking show. Misha Green is an intense story teller, taking you on a thrill ride that leaves you craving more!"
444,"People need to understand that this is just for fun. If you take it too seriously, then you're going to miss out on a great show.
I don't usually review tv shows and I'm not an expert about what goes into filming shows and such, but why are people giving this such a hard time?
I absolutely love this show! I love the way its shot. I love that it takes place during the segregation era (not that I agree with segregation at all, that's not the point here). This is something special, in that, I haven't seen it before. Not in the context that it plays out. Again, not to be prejudicial here, but fantasy, aliens, wizards, the dead, vampires, and the macabre are not something I usually see in African American based tv shows. This is fresh, and it's different, it's smart, and the sequences are shot perfectly. The writing is great! The use of literature and music in the show are phenomenal. It's what wins me over the most, plus the acting is superb!
If people would just stop trying to pick loopholes to complain about because it's not done to their liking and just sit and watch the show for what it is: a fantastical journey into a spellbinding world, then you would get so much more out of it.
I mean, how is this any different from the CW shows that make millions out there off this kind of story telling? It's kinda the same concept except HBO does it better!
Everyone went crazy with Stranger Things right? Nothing wrong there, right?! Please, people.
Enjoy the show, stop complaining that it isn't perfect. It's phenomenal.
Don't try to dissect it into some comparison that you just find ""doesn't fit well with the culture of science fiction because, blah, blah, blah."" It's an adaptation based off a book, that is all.
Give it a chance, sit through it, and go for a ride. If this does anything for me, it truly helps me get over the stress of the day. It's that much fun because I'm transported...and that should be the point here."
445,"This show is amazing, it brings forth what BLACK PEOPLE go through through the eyes of BLACK PEOPLE.... its amazing and I can't wait for more"
446,"It reveals to much to fast.
So far its a slasher horror when i hoped for psychological horror.
Yet i find it much to serious for a slasher horror so im left awkwardly with a slasher horror thats taking itself serious.This is a review of the first episode. So dont take it to seriously"
447,"Artful television. Feels like a movie. Beautifully tackles racism, violence and Jim Crow society while having an incredible central mystery driving the plot. Acting is superb, production value excellent."
448,"Loving this first episode. Well written, well acted, and suspenseful. The cliffhanger at the end has me wondering why (No spoilers) and I'll stay tuned in for the upcoming epidods."
449,"I've been starving for some new horror adventure supspense thriller content and this hit all the right spots for me and then some!!! I'm a fan of Stuart Gordon, Brian Yuzna, Sam Raimi, Mariano Baino, Carpenter, the new RLJE titles Housewife and Color of Space and The Void etc. I'm also a voraciously avid reader of Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, Ramsey Campbell, Brian Lumley, Arthur Machen, Algernon Blackwood, Edgar Rice Burroughs, August Derleth and of course Lovecraft himself, not to mention author Matt Ruff Lovecraft Country. If you're a fan this is it! So many references and so much visceral eye candy!!! Alot of thought went into this! Fans of the literature, the book, and the genre overall get their moments in this! Check, check, and check!!! Exceeded my expectations by a mile! Jordan Peele and JJ Abrams, nice work!!! The cast is wonderful and the locations and cinematography are awesome! You guys have done us fans a solid! Can't wait to see more of this epic tale!"
450,"Premiere was so dope!! Most shows tend to have a slow burn to introduce and this managed to introduce and have a punch to it! So many themes to explore from history, racism in america, monsters, aliens, mysteries, the whole works. I cant wait to see what it brings next."
451,We need season 2. Amazing show cannot stop watching.
452,"I'm a sixty-four yr old white woman.
I absolutely loved this story. The cast was great, the acting perfection. Made me laugh, made me cry. Our history is so horrible at times. It was nice to see the truth with a little horror and fantasy thrown in. Well done!!!!!!"
453,"The the story telling is smart and creative. The series looks gorgeous with the backdrop of 50's Chicago. The mixture of SciFi and horror is excellent. There has never been a series that centers Blackness and tell our complicated stories. ""I am"" was one of the BEST episodes."
454,"This is by far one of the best shows in television, in a very, very long time. The way factual historical events are incorporated into the show is fantastic. Having strong Black lead characters who have depth and are believable is so necessary. I truly hope there is a 2nd season we don't have to wait a couple of years for. Just exceptionally well done."
455,"Beautifully dressed and well set in the time period, great actors, very peculiar story.You have these three really nice, kind, good black people going out on a road trip to find a family member. Everywhere they go they are mocked and/or terrified by white people. They even get attacked by a super racist sheriff who, with his buds, drags them out in the woods to be MURDERED for being 'out after dark', evilly laughing all the while.OK!! The ""monsters"" come up out of the ground to attack and save our brave trio but Lovecraft sure never saw any of these in his wonderfully fertile imagination. I think they used the name 'Lovecraft' to lure in the young people who just love those books. If they called it Mean White People Hurt Good Black People the audience probably would be less. Well, less white people anyway.I say no spoilers because all these bits are shown on the trailers."
456,I can't wait to see more of this! I really hope it does well. I haven't read any of the negative comments that other reviews mention. Other than a slowish start there was nothing I didn't like. This definitely has potention. Lead actors had solid performances. Definitely check this one out.
457,"I expect the next episodes will be stronger, beautiful acting, great photography, I expect it will be more beautiful than stranger things"
458,"This premiere was a great start to a black sci-fi series! When you have Jordan Peel as the creator and JJ Abrams as an Executive producer, you know it's going to be good."
459,No surprise - sensitive egos are out in all force downvoting as soon as there is a show with a largely black cast with depictions of racism. Hope people ignore the reviews stemming from white fragility and give this show a chance.Getting back to the business of actually reviewing: this is an exciting show and I can't wait to see how it all unfolds. The acting is great and production done very well. Not sure why so many are commenting negatively on the CGI. I found it entirely satisfactory. The Witcher was a show that failed on that department and Lovecraft Country is leagues ahead.Great start and hopefully I will be treated to a great continuation when the confusing (as of now) story unfolds. I have patience and am not left without entertainment until I hopefully am treated for a great season finale.
460,"Jordan Peele is a genius. Even you find his other work a little clunky or on the nose, I think you may still enjoy this a lot. Just being black and traveling cross country in the green book era creates a baseline level of danger and tension that puts the viewer constantly on edge. When the monsters show up it's actually an incredible relief and release of all of that. Very entertaining, love the background of the main character, war vet who loves sci-fi and fantasy I read in college, Lovecraft, Burroughs, Wells, etc. then ends up living in it. I think they really do a fantastic Job of baseline World building.I'm only one episode in but I'm hooked.While the show is very meta in its premise, it's all played very straight, without people breaking character, and the grounded elements (the home neighborhood, the racism across the gorgeous picture perfect countryside, family life). Actors are all excellent. Direction is excellent. Clearly there is a bigger arc going on, but i understand many of the episodes will also be MOTW. Special effects so far very professional.Don't seek to be promoting this one that hard On the HBO Max app. But I think it could be breakout hit. Much more accessible than Watchmen, which this will inevitably compared to (I loved both. But Watchmen moved slowly definitely was aimed at a more comic book audience and required full investment and concentration on detail to enjoy. Lovecraft Country is compelling just being with the characters, especially Atticus, living lives in 1950s America. A war vet who fought for his country with many towns that don't even let him eat in a restaurant. The pride. The anger. The resentment. So much to bear.Hopefully the main bigger story arc will hold up as the series Unfolds. I have faith in Peele."
461,"A brilliant hybrid of entertainment, elements of history, horror, music, fantastic looking visuals and my new favorite character Leti, the acting from this ensemble is superb, above all it is serialized how it concludes, all in all , this show has gotten off to a good start, bravo to the production team for this Gem."
462,"A new mix of Horror and Social Relevance. I'm not really into Horror,but this one,AND it's great cast has me hooked after the pilot. Misha Green has a groundbreaking hit on her hands!"
463,"It seems crazy that anyone is rating this single episode a 9 or a 2. The acting is good, the production is good, the story is intriguing, but most of the episode is boring. Nothing much happens until the last 10 minutes. I'm interested to watch the next episode but the pilot doesn't match other HBO pilots like Game of Thrones, Westworld, or Succession. Very little happened in an hour and I can only think of three plot points that need to be explored this season. Overall, I'm disappointed because I was so excited."
464,"Strong acting, it was a weird show but I like weird."
465,"First episode crushed, really looking forward to the rest. Really loved the Baldwin clip - still so timely, and great to see it included - as well as the near immediate attention paid to Lovecraft's racism."
466,This show after one episode is sooo many things and unlike any show thus far!!! Loving it!! Can't wait for the next episode!!!
467,"The first minutes might throw some people off, it did me. i just hope people stick around for those few minutes because this is a real, story with great actors. people need to see these kind of stories, they are not easy to watch, but people need to know. i just loved it, and i am a tough audience."
468,"Starts off with crazy unexpected visuals, then the story slows down a bit, but picks up at the perfect time. Can't wait to see where the story takes us."
469,This show has a lot of potential. I don't understand the horrible rating after one episode.
470,"We all know normally premieres are slow, boring, and set up to give us the foundation to the rest of the series. This premiere was not the case! Yes, the base for the show was created but it was engaging, intense, and beyond exciting. The fears were both based in reality and the supernatural. 10/10 I can't wait to see what comes in the future episodes!"
471,"This is show everything I needed! From the actors, the storyline that keeps you wanting more, to the little known black history facts that I have learned from watching this show.... it's all amazing. The clothes they were are on point for the era. The messages that are subtly displayed every episode that make you have to stop and think and then rewatch the episode to fully understand. After the show I even tune in to the podcast for the full breakdown of every episode! Kuddos to the writing team for the show, you have done a phenomenal job!"
472,This one is a must see! The characters go on a journey from fighting for equality in the 1950s Jim Crow era to fighting real monsters in a sci-fi twist! I see a new genre on the horizon and I'm excited for it!
473,"Episode 1 is really good. The acting, pacing, scenery, etc. Courtney B. Vance is always good in his roles and I'm excited to see the brother that plays Atticus shine. Journee was good and I'm always excited to see Aunjanue Eliis (she's criminally underrated). I'm a sci-fi fan and so far, the show seems like it's going to be a treat to watch. Don't listen to the naysayers, watch for yourself and make a decision!"
474,"Overall it is good but oh my god the main guy Jonathan Majors is the worst person for this role, my god he makes this series unwatchable."
475,This show is a wonderful treat! They say the writers and directors have placed black culture mixed with these genre or film is amazing!! The actors are on point!
476,"The basic story is great, full of mystery, imagination and magic. To further power that, add excellent technical production, good cast and direction.
This could be simply great, but no ... there it comes the biased left ideology, that is so present in most forms of media and press, in their continuous unfair use of their productions as a vehicle for political and social indoctrination. They love (hate?) to promote racism and to use racism to explain all human problems and difficulties, be personal or collective. They don't want us to see others by their ethical and moral character, how they are and think, their actions and behavior.
In one episode the show plays a song ... it sings something like ""whiteys on the moon"" ... can anything be more racist than this?
So, unfortunately, this is just another damaged show, focused to racial propaganda, aiming for more racism, while claiming to combat racism and to foster diversity.
After some living experience everyone knows that respect, life quality and material success is achieved with hard work, not simply given, seized or granted. What really matters is your mindset, your ideas, after all, and less your race, ethnic, gender, etc."
477,The very first episode had me hollin' and on the edge of my seat. Can't wait for episode 2 on August 23. BRING IT!!!!
478,"Omg, this show makes you feel everything! Joy, pain, fear...it is EXHILARATING"
479,I just finished episode one and all i can say is WOW. The tension-filled atmosphere just feels right.
480,"I loved the premiere! I was seriously hooked by all of the emotions I saw. I was amazed by the accurate representation of what it was like to live as a black person, in America, at that time. The cliff hanger has me so anxious to see episode 2!"
481,"Went into this show with no expectations and very little knowledge, other than some sense that some fantasy/sci-fi themes would be present, from little exposure to the trailers and advertisements.My girlfriend and I loved it!! We can't wait to see where the story goes. The perfect harmony of 1950s societal (specifically racial) issues with a world of monsters and monstrous men provides viewers with an experience of fun, thrilling adventure and thought-provoking social commentary all wrapped in an engaging story with truly loveable characters. I highly recommend it."
482,This show has me captivated from beginning to end. The characters & story was amazing!
483,"I've been waiting for a decent Lovecraftian story to make it to the screen. This is it. It's also going to make a lot of people uncomfortable with its very topical depiction of bigotry, police brutality and racial injustice. Loads of atmosphere, fantastic acting and enough suspense and thrills to take you on a pretty compelling adventure.Just who are the real monsters in this tale? That sundown sequence was the scariest part.Can't wait to see the next episode. I'm liking the tone so far."
484,Not writing a novel here. Give it a shot. I like it. Wish it was on Netflix though. I'd binge the hell out of it.
485,Amazing. I can't wait to see what's next. I love how it's set up and the twist of science fiction is superb.
486,I'm only rating this because it deserves the 10/10
487,"How can the rating show 5.7 if all the reviews have 8 and above. 23 out of 26 are 10, 3 are 8 and 9.
How does this work?
Anyhow, I loved the first episode! Great storytelling, acting, scenery. Authentic feeling of the Fifties. It is uncomfortable to watch at times, which is necessary. It's the whole package and it left me wanting more."
488,"One day it will be over. Yep, that's the problem. This show is so RICH with Black History, sci-fi themes, traditional horror and literary nods that if you blink, you can guarantee that you've missed something. Which also means that it has very high re-watchability. This is changing but you rarely see (especially in the horror genre) a near fully Black cast of characters so nuanced and so well developed. That's what makes this show a gem! It's so hard to explain succinctly because there's a little bit of something in there for everyone! There's social commentary on both past and current events, there are deep mysteries, there are good old fashioned jump scares and gore, there are elements of psychological thrillers. The community that this show has created (from everyone trying to put all the puzzle pieces together) is amazing and one I know I'll treasure for a very long time. Best of all, we have an amazing example of how dynamic Black characters can be as protagonists in their own horror stories. This show is anything but predictable. Anything but the norm. Everything Black horror fans needed.Like I said, there's something for EVERYONE so if you're confused or frustrated (you're probably supposed to be) watch it with a friend, join a FB group or listen to one of the many recap podcasts because I promise you this show is going to surprise you."
489,I love this show. I think it has a ton of wonderful subliminal messages. A Must Watch!!
490,"Okay it's based on some novel, and there is like nothing to do with H.P. Lovecraft or any Chtulu like stuff. Disappointing because I thought it will be something like that, but it's something really different.It's not that bad, I just excpected something else because of the title, and I don't even know there is novel with the same title which do not relates to H. P. Lovecraft."
491,"I'm enjoying the show. I do intend to continue watching, but I do wish it would focus a little less on how awful every single caucasian in the world is, and more on the story we're there to see. Not one single, remotely redeemable or even halfway decent white character can make things a bit repetitive. I'll be enjoying the fantasy and horror elements and then it takes a small time out to remind us that white people are bad. Like a commercial break or something. ""This episode sponsored by every Caucasian is detestable! Now back to the show"" I know this was a rough time period in America, but surely there was at least the chance of bumping into a white person once in a while that wasn't excited at the possibility of tormenting and killing African Americans. Still, I like the main cast and the story is interesting enough to look beyond the inherant hatred of all that is caucasian. It's so constant I just sort of take it in stride at this point. I expect the big finale to involve Cthulhu busting out in a white shirt and tie, listening to Rick Astley and chanting the N word, but that'll be fun to watch, at least."
492,This executively produced by Jordan Peele and JJ Abrams. It shows the quality is good. The dialogue is amazing and cgi. I'm guessing Abrams oversaw the sci-fi and Jordan the international relationships. This episode is a great start.
493,"For those who like horror, well-produced period dramas, with intelligent dialogue, quality cinematography, prestige acting, sprinkled with a twist of scifi-fantasy and social reflection.
Look no further. Lovecraft Country is here."
494,It's a great mix of sci-fi and historical facts. It's captivating every week and keeps you at the edge of your seat. I love the use/ mix of outrageous horrors and things horrible things that happened in that era to scare audience.
495,"My favorite series right now. I hope there is a season two. I haven't been truly scared of any show or movie in a very long time. I love AHS. This last episode of Lovecraft Country (episode 8) left me scared of those dancing girls, topsy and bopsy. Amazing dancing and so scary!"
496,Episode 105 blew my mind. Directing that episode must have been surreal
497,"Finally, I can see scifi, horror, love & history in this beautiful piece being presented. I'm enjoying this ride Lovecraft Country has me on with wonderful writing, casting & artistry! BRAVO!
👏👏👏👏"
498,I absolutely love this show.. The first episode had me confused but still intrigued. I've probably rewatched every episode 10/12 times. Sunday can't get here fast enough. Hands down Lovecraft Country is the best television show on tv right now. The characters are beautifully flawed and the storyline is something I haven't seen with a majority black cast. I love it and I will be impatiently awaiting a season 2!!
499,Every minute is action filled. The characters' backstories are all being revealed. The cast is totally outstanding.
500,Lovecraft Country is one of the most amazing shows I've watched in a while. Each episode is so full it's never a dull moment. Everything in this show means something not a line or event is waisted. The writers keep the viewers on our toes with this show. It has so many Easter eggs that are historic references. I love a show that makes you think and calls on you to know and learn while being entertained!!
501,"I really wanted to like this more. I think episode 6 was the nail in the coffin for me. Unfortunately the main characters themselves commit monstrous acts and it's unsettling to sympathize with them.We see episode 6 from the perspective of a Korean sex demon, who has already killed 99 men by exploding them during sex. Before destroying them in a shower of blood she also experiences their memories and ""absorbs"" their souls. At one point she says she's seen more bad than good, but even so this leaves room for a lot of innocent guys. We also see her seducing a complete stranger so it's hard to imagine that she actually knows the men before she pulverizes them. She also has a mother who is actively encouraging her to kill in the vague uncertain hope that this will bring back the soul of her true daughter.So I found it fairly difficult to sympathize with this woman. We see her loving Judy Garland movies but the contrast between the grotesque and the saccharine just put me off more. Similarly in this episode, we see Atticus the soldier murdering and torturing innocent nurses. He doesn't visibly see shaken up by it, and it's hard to imagine someone committing atrocities and then making casual banter about Alexandre Dumas. Typically murder and torture is the behaviour of the antagonists in a horror show. It's hard to see these guys as the good guys.Another case in point is when the Montrose character murders the strange girl they find. The sympathetic scenes that follow in the subsequent episode didn't work for me because he murdered this girl for really no good reason. The disconnect in this show is simply too great at times. The contrasting scenes, the horrific behaviour of the lead characters, makes me feel turned off."
502,"This show is for the books, this show is way beyond 2020 if we all know what ""2020"" have brought to us. The cast, the music, the scenes, the writing. Just amazing! This show will captivate your mind. Love live it!!!"
503,I think this is a very cool show with great acting and great special effects. I had no idea what the show was about. I went into the show blind not having even read an article about it. I must admit I was getting a little bored toward the end of the episode but the last 15min changed that quick! Give it a chance if you like horror/mystery flicks.
504,"I must admit, the name Lovecraft intrigued me, but it's not really related to H.P. Lovecraft's works as far as I know, at least at this early stage in the show. But it is about supernatural horror.What really impresses me is that despite the cast, this is not a 'black TV show', or black actors shoehorned into 'white' roles for sake of diversity. I'm not a fan of Hollywood PC nonsense. Instead, it's a well-written story that weaves the very real experiences of racism in the '50's with a mainstream horror genre that can appeal to a wide audience. The subtle (or perhaps not-so), clever aspect of the story is that you really have two kinds of horrors happening-the supernatural kind and the real kind that blacks experienced.The leads are likable, and despite a bit of 'comeuppance' for the white villains, you do end up rooting for the protagonists in overcoming both kinds of terrors they are facing.I do hope, though, they don't overdo it. Not all whites of that era were racists and klan folk. And if the show crosses that line and becomes about gratuitous slaughter of white people show after show, the show would lose the delicate balance between entertainment and the racist message of violent retribution, and that'll be a shame and a missed opportunity."
505,Great actors with substance... It is entertainment & when watching entertainment PLEASE try to be entertained & not political... Very interesting & makes you go get more knowledge
506,I liked the first episode so much but since then each new episode is for me worse than the previous with the exception of the one taking place in Korea.
507,"Has lots of potential, could have been a great show, stories are interesting, but pacing and storytelling is very uneven. The actors and production design are great. Some of the dialogue is so quiet it is incomprehensible, but all the noise and music crystal clear and loud. After 5 episodes I still have no idea what the show is about, there is a real casual approach to having a storyline."
508,"But Lovecraft Country took a drastic turn for the worse this past episode (e04). Wtf? I think they were trying to sort of parody a Raiders Of The Lost Ark feel but all they seemed to get was the lost factor right, it was all over the place and seemed really under-rehearsed and directionless like halfway through The Outsider mini-series if you saw that nightmare. I don't mind the racial tensions, I think we need to be aware of how truly scary it was for a black person to be caught out after dark, it's sick the way they were treated and that's the real horror story. This past episode was comical at best though and I really hope they can get this thing back on track and stop trying to shoot for cute in the middle of it all. They lost a few stars from my initial impression."
509,"This has to be one of the most racist shows I have ever seen. All the white characters in this show are portraied as bad without exception. I agree that african americans suffered a lot in the past due to white people, some still do. But there have also always been good white people that helped black people. This show is one sided.
I believe all people are equal and should be treated equally and have equal opportunities. I believe african americans were not treated equally in the past and that was very wrong. But what this show does is a step in the wrong direction, not toward equality.
That being said, my grade does not include the racism or it would have been a lot lower. I gave it a six because at times the story was good and most of the actors played very good roles( especially Journee Smollett and Michael K. Williams), but a lot of episodes felt like fillers and some were dissapointments. The finale was also very uninspired, without any surprises and a total let down.
It felt like the show tried to follow an agenda without paying much attention to the plot development. Plot holes remained and certain events made no sense. I don't think I would watch a second season."
510,"This show was absolutely marvelous, with great acting, great camera works, going into very important and sensitive topics without falling into SJW propaganda, while keeping a very interesting story at the same time.This is no small feat, considering the multiple directions the show went, to be able to make it still very interesting and coherent was pretty hard.However they botched everything with the ending. I mean, honestly, the whole show presents us with apartheid, women struggles, rich vs poor and everything that was and is still unjust in our time.But what is the conclusion ? Black people just take their revenge and their youngest turns into a cold blooded murderer supervillain ? That's it ? Aren't they capable of transcending ? Of forgiveness ? Of being above the ones who oppressed them ? No ? You give black people power they just do like what has been done to them ?Is that the conclusion of the show ? All humans are garbage ? They play for their own team only ? It's impossible to be together and heal ?This show was a 9/10 until the last 15 minutes, now it's a 5 for acting and camera but 0 for the message."
511,Really wanted to watch this show but utterly disappointed on how badly they made it
512,"Bad bad leroy brown baddest show in the whole damned town , this is no good, stupid concept and i don't care about blm, but hey maybe you like it, if you do watch it or if you don't watch someting else"
513,"After the first episode I didn't know what to make of this show. I was watching it based upon a recommendation so I was willing to give it a shot. By ep 3 I was convinced I didn't like the show and it is nothing that I'd ever recommend. Still, because it was to be discussed in a bi-weekly Zoom chat, I watched all ten episodes. Now I feel like I need a lobotomy.I normally don't watch TV shows because 1.) there are too many out there to choose from and 2.) I don't have the patience. It only takes about a season for me to tire of characters and their endless sagas. I much prefer movies because even if I'm not a fan of the characters I only have to suffer their annoyances for about two hours.""Lovecraft Country"" is ostensibly about race and racism in America. It's set circa 1955 with the main characters being Black, so you know racism was unavoidable. That's about as real as it got because with the racial element there is the co-main theme: magic. I'm not talking Penn & Teller illusionist/sleight of hand stuff, I'm talking dark arts witchcraft. And that's where the show lost me. I'm not a fan of it and have never been a fan of it. Witchcraft and spells as an ancillary theme, sure, but as the main theme requiring blood, incantations, and stuff like that--I'll pass.Atticus (Johnathan Majors), Leti (Jurnee Smollett), Hippolyta (Aunjanue Ellis), Montrose (Michael Kenneth Williams), and George (Courtney B. Vance) spend the season chasing after spells, books, and other magic related paraphernalia. Atticus, through his mother, had the blood of Titus, the founder of the order, in him. Because of this he has always had an inherent drive to get the answers to certain questions.If we were to go deeper, we may find a lot more disagreeable elements. The main takeaway that irked me was that the main characters continually made deals with the devil. The devil here wasn't satan, but the devil here was a blond haired, ice blue-eyed, white woman. Whenever any of the main characters got into a serious jam they'd summon her. Naturally, her aid came at a steep price which they were willing to pay. They'd pay the price and she'd give them the magic necessary to temporarily solve their problem. But it was always magic. Magic that I could barely even keep up with, and didn't much care to--Titus's Book of Names, some other pages, this mark, that seal, the other spell--it was all foreign to me and pretty much remained foreign until the end. Then they threw a time travel device in there for the sci-fi crowd (or just to break from the sorcery stuff). But it still all came back to magic.If only all of our African blooded predecessors had magic, then maybe they could've lived longer, gotten further, or achieved more. Like the strength and power whites had was in magic and we only needed to wrestle it away from them to become equally powerful or at least to mitigate their power. It made the whole matter of racism seem far more fantastic, yet so trivial as though a book of spells was enough to prevent it. There was a small ode to God and religion in the show, but it was just an aside as if to say, ""You can try this too. It can't hurt."" For me, my upbringing, and my beliefs; none of this we live in or through is due to magic and no amount of chanted spells is going to change that."
514,"She saved them from the policemen on episode 1.
She saved Let in the shooting, made her invunerable to survive all the ""back to the future"" episode, made her invunerable again to save her in the last episode.
She taught Tic the protection speel, saving him from the shooting too.
She saved Dee from turn into the creepy doll.
She bought them a mansion.
And all she wanted was the sacrifice of a man who was a murder and a torturer of innocent people. Cristina was the true hero, and you know it."
515,"I wanted to love Lovecraft Country. Jordan Peele, Misha Green, period horror, the occult -- it all sounded great. And you know, a lot of it is. The cast is extremely talented, the cinematography, particularly in the first two episodes, is gorgeous, and some of the musical choices are perfection. The show, however, is a giant mess.Oftentimes things just happen. You're dropped into an episode and it feels like you missed an episode, but that episode doesn't exist. People do things without any particular motivation. Characters appear whose backstories are told in clumsily done exposition -- only for you to find out they're sort of irrelevant anyways. And those musical choices that are sometimes perfection -- other times you get jarringly out of place music that doesn't work at all for the time period or the action onscreen.The show delves into certain areas of racial politics with great nuance, and then at other times has cops behave like caricatures out of Dolemite movies. The tone is all over the place. Sometimes we're meant to be scared, and then in the next scene people dance around to the Jeffersons theme like it's a comedy. There's a lot that's delightful to it, but also a lot that's just emblematic of a show in which no one seems to have focused the vision of the creator. There's a wonderful episode that takes place in Korea -- it's beautifully shot, and as a self contained piece, lovely, but it does absolutely nothing to advance the plot of the series as a whole.The biggest weaknesses of the show are the CGI, which looks noticeably and oddly cheap at times, and uses of historical figures like Emmett Till that felt oddly exploitative. Where Watchmen masterfully used the Tulsa Race riot to frame an entire season of drama, Lovecraft Country trots out historical figures like winking nods, often using them to justify torturing characters in the show in the manner in which those figures were killed. You can see where the creators were going, but it just feels off.Is it worth a watch? Yes. Particularly for the first couple of episodes. But after that it spins wildly off the rails, never really delivering on the promise of the beginning of the series."
516,"The opening scene shows typical alien spaceships invading the planet. The next scene talks about Jim Crow. Then we get hit over the head with a series of murderous white psychopaths (as if that's all white people are).I really WANTED to watch their journey into Lovecraft country. I wanted to know what was going on with Ardam, the South Korea phone call, etc. But it was just too much for me to get past the pilot."
517,"Great promise, cast are all great, shot well and the cgi looks ok I thought. However, it's just a mess, structurally it's all over the place. Weird scenes inserted that go nowhere, jumps in the narrative that leaves you feeling you have missed an episode. Major plot points are never addressed or discussed. It's just clunky."
518,"This series has nothing to do with the work of H. P. Lovecraft, and I resent being tricked into watching it by false advertising. Leaving that aside, I still didn't enjoy this series because the stories didn't make sense and the characters are crude and unrealistic. The dialogue is also painfully bad."
519,"This series is getting better with every single episode. It is rich in story dynamics, historical references and has so many layers that you will willingly want to re-watch every episode to gather all the details you may have missed! It is emotionally provocative, so many will talk against its substantive girth; many will feel uncomfortable with its rare insight into Black life during the 1950s from an intelligent, Black perspective. The portrayal of Black intellect, fearlessness, communal strength are all superb and sorely needed on screen. The shifts in scenes are like a dreamscape that we are watching from afar; it is creative and not many can hold on properly, so they are not comfortable watching. This show is like a movie that I would pay to watch back-to-back in theaters. It isn't ""scary"" in the sense of horror, as the genre has been traditionally portrayed--instead, the fear factor is created by the racially-charged craziness faced by the Black characters in Jim Crow era America. I am grateful for the series and hopeful it thrives. We deserve it!"
520,"Anti white race propaganda show. Lovecraftian distortion.
Absolutely appalling"
521,"Lovecraft Country is one of the best sci-fi/monster series in the last decade without any doubt (as of now). If it goes well, it could become one of the all time bests. The direction and overall making is top notch. The pilot introduces a quite a good number of intriguing and engrossing elements. Since the story is set in early 1900s, it's hard to not include the then rampant segregation and hyper racial hatred. This is where the writers have done a terrific job. They use racial-discrimination very well to add a bit more suspense, thrill, and a sense of adventure instead of delivering preachy messages or invoking sympathy or anger."
522,I haven't been this intrigued with a show since Watchmen. The fusion of African-American history in the Jim Crow south with sci-fi is brilliant. The previews for the episodes to come has me enthralled!!! Cannot wait to watch how this story unravels! Bravo!
523,"If you love sci-fi based in history then you have to give this series a try. Given only one episode has aired, what was introduced is anxiety inducing, edge of seat action with great acting and storyline. Don't allow negative detractors to sway your curiosity, watch e1 and make your own conclusion."
524,"To those who complain this isn't Lovecraft, not Cthulhu - take it up with the novelist the show is based on.To those who think the show is ""too black"" - well, it's about time and you can take a long walk off a short pier.To those who like innovative long-form entertainment - definitely give this a try. It's unusual, it's new and that means it's fresh. Looks great, plays with tropes and forms, has great performances and dialogue and manages to balance social awareness with a pulp horror for modern sensibilities. One of the most original things on at the moment."
525,"After how HBO decided to end Game of Thrones I really felt like HBO was going to die in my heart. Finishing the pilot of this series left me wanting more of it. It's that interesting.
The show has a great cast (9/10) and nice CGI (7/10 - can be improved).
The most important thing this movie offers, but the others (Lovecraft related) couldn't is offering us all his books in a single marvelous series. I am really a big Lovecraft fan and I've read many of his books and seen lot of cinematic interpretations, but this one I am certain will cover everything."
526,"The series is off to a great start with episode 1. It is a bit slow the first 15 minutes or so, but the show has so good rhythm and good actors, that the ""slow parst"" work really well. It has some great ""oh f***"" moments, and the effects are pretty good. The mystery building also just adds on to the already great atmosphere.To all you 1/10 rating snowflakes, go back to the 50's and cry me a river."
527,I'm in after the first show. If you don't know the culture and picked up on certain aspects of the show you wouldn't understand.
528,"I'm not familiar with the source material but with every rewatch the first episode grows with texture and depth. Misha Green has a commanding presence and is ably supported by veterans Smollett and Vance (whom I once met at The Alaska Playwrights Festival; referenced his famous early appearance on Law & Order). The period look is note perfect, and while the FX are a touch hokey the terror and direction is fast-paced. The previews for the rest of the season look fascinating. Good job, HBO!"
529,"By the end of just the first episode, our characters have survived so much, in a stunning, plot-packed addition to the horror canon.And like a true horror film, we end on a cliffhanger. It isn't Atticus's father who greets the characters at the door of the giant mansion in Ardham, but rather a blond white man who strangely says, ""We've been expecting you Mr. Freeman ... Welcome home."" Will they survive whatever comes in the sequel?"
530,"Lovecraft has always been a guilty pleasure of mine but this is a pure, unadulterated cosmic horror masterpiece.Casting and acting is spot on, creature design is straight out of the books, so excited to see more!!"
531,I loved the whole episode!! It's a mind blowing experience to watch. I look forward to watching the entire season.
532,"Started amazing, by the fifth episode it got plain weird (in a whats-going-on kinda way) and ended with 'we took all of the magic from white people'.Overall it's beautiful to watch, acting is on point, but the story is just random and the end is so rushed that it hurts. In the final episode the most interesting female characters die in the most stupid way and it's generally a huge disappointment to see this awesome cast act out this randomness of events."
533,I need to binge this 100 times and yet HBO only gave us one episode. I've watched episode one four times since Sunday. There were so many details and nuance packed into the one hour slot.I haven't felt this excited since season one-four it GOT.
534,"Great cinematography, great acting, great CGI and of course, great story. First episode was amazing. I look forward to see the whole season!"
535,Hell of an intro. Can't wait for more! The sci-fi / fantasy appeal for this is off the charts.
536,Had to make an account just to review. It's only the pilot and I'm hooked. I have no idea what to expect and I am 100% okay with that.
537,"Amazing show, haven't been this excited for a show ina while. Likeable characters, ominous atmosphere and a compelling and enthralling story. Add in some top notch lovecraft horror and reflection on racism in america and you got an incredible show, can't wait for the second episode."
538,"This show has got off on a great start. Looks beautiful, great acting and an intriguing premise. Looking forward to the 2nd episode."
539,"I have been anticipating this show since I've seen the trailers. The writing is original, the acting is superb and the cinematography is one of a kind. To have a show that depicts black history in all of its beauty and agony is amazing because a lot of black history is a mix of bliss and sadness which they've depicted well with a metaphysical twist. This series create endless discussions amongst your peers on spirituality, history, race, lovecraft the author and how he would feel about the series especially considering his views, familial bonds, family secrets, the duality of light and dark and most importantly;are some parts of us monstrous?"
540,"I love all things historical, the good the bad and the ugly. This show forces you to dig in, research and fact check. There are so many little Easter eggs in this show! Im forced to breakdown each episode and rewatch them several times.The gore and guts are amazing and the storyline takes so many turns that you have to watch every week or you will be lost! This show is not for the weak and you will be triggered. It will display things that we may hate, but art is all about reflection.We were representative of the era in this show, you will feel all of that . This is who we were(some of us are still there)and it has to be acknowledged You may feel anger, shame, some may roll their eyes in frustration, you may feel deep pain...whatever it makes you feel..push through and enjoy..its worth it."
541,"I absolutely love Lovecraft Country. It's complex and forces you to think as you watch. It merges Sci-Fi with a period piece; Jim Crow with horror, sprinkled with convoluted love stories and more (e.g. politics, adventure, fantasy). I thoroughly enjoy learning from the embedded history as well, such as the Bessie Stringfield Easter egg, and the perspective of the Emmit Till murder. The character development, their backstories, and their interactions always leave me wanting to know more about each of them individually. I'm eager to find out how their various stories are connected.
All in all... A MUST WATCH!"
542,"I really like the series, at least the horror/mystery part is really cool, but just after 3-4 chapters the series are getting ""too HBO"", with meaningless sex scenes, plots that deviate from the trama just to please their liberal viewer base, (even to the point to justify racial violence against white people, because you know, ""these white people is bad, they deserve it"") and ""too deep"" character development which takes important time from the suspense/terror main plot.
I know topics like racism are very important these days, to not repeat the same mistakes of the past, but sometimes one just wants to turn the TV and watch some good suspense show and forget for one hour how screwed the world is right now."
543,Finally a tv show showcasing real horror for Black Americans. Not only do the cast have to battle everyday racism and danger they have to battle a crumbling secret society and magic. Every episode we are captivated by the complexities of each character and REAL historical horrors. I can't wait for season two!!
544,Okay so I'll say I didn't know much about the show going in.but man what a fun ride was about to turn it off but then once the shootout started it hardly let up I personally really loved it and I can't wait till next week
545,I knew nothing about this shoe going in and I can't remember the last movie or tv show that left me feeling the way I did. Also Jonathan Majors is a star!
546,Only one episode in and I'm hooked. As a fanboy of the games and lovecraft universe I can't wait for the next episode. And fyi it has 1500 10 star reviews because its just that good. I'm looking forward to someone going insane and many more people dieing! Yay!!!
547,It's rare to see people of color as main characters of sci-fi productions. This series brings in relevant issues and ties it into a sci-fi escape I've always been waiting for!
548,"I have played The Call of Cthulhu off and on for years and this would fit into any campaign.Love the show, the feeling of mystery. Behind every closed door is another maze. Just average people learning about a world they never imagined even existed. Mysterious cults, with strange mind-bending goals and knowledge. Monsters and unimaginable power.The period is correct, with some license to make it more relatable for younger people. I think the acting and effects are well done. The story is interesting and I want to see where it goes. I have not read the book, I will after the show is done.I have been a long time fan of HP Lovecraft, don't think there is anything I have not read. This is not based on HP Lovecraft's works, but is in the same vein.The pacing varies, I enjoy the sense of mystery. I have not felt like the story was dragging. It feels like new avenues are opening up and new directions are possible every time the characters learn new information. I am discovering a new world along with the characters and want to see more...Please keep this going as long as you can."
549,"The storyline is showcases Black Leads in a way that is rarely shown in mainstream media. The acting is great, and the plots also crosses a various array of genres."
550,"A bizarre therapy piece that exists in a superposition of underperforming any of the worst marvel cinematic schlock, and vastly outdoing birth of a nation. it operates in a state of absolute lack of self-awareness, while falling forward through a series of tenuously joined cliches forming nothing that looks anything like a coherent, thoughtful, or interesting narrative. it is truly a wonder that anyone, let alone the heavy-hitter producers behind this project, could or would sit down to this presentation and not be awestruck by its pointlessness, or by its failure to understand even its own trite and often wrong premises. any profound or interesting analysis to be had about this series is solely through a meta-analysis of the content, a psychoanalysis of its creators and what factors could possibly have lead them to produce, much less release, such a disaster. the acting and casting is nothing to really write home about either--there's not much i could imagine an actor having agency over in this, and were it not that i fully expect that they would (and will, and do) congratulate and over congratulate themselves and the creators on a job well done for this total abortion, i might say the execution wasn't exactly their fault. suffice it to say, you can expect a great deal of sympathy (especially when it's inappropriate) being begged and pleaded for by the (unsurprisingly overbearing) soundtrack, at every opportunity, and insisted by a superficially grandiose or saccharine drama by nearly every character--which with any critical thought is nothing but functionally flat, and plainly insulting. it's actually nuts thinking back to some of the (very, very rare) opportunities for interesting characters to develop, which are all swiftly bypassed without mention and often (bordering on always) in the pursuit of a totally wrong and backwards non-point, many times counter to the actual truth of the matter--betraying the expectations of any sensible and genuine character a sane person would imagine in the scenario. there's not a whole lot more worth saying in general about the project--any worthwhile, meaningful, or even just coherent or correct point that had an opportunity to be made through the narrative certainly didn't crystallize in the writers' room--and almost always runs totally counter to the overarching premises. maybe worth the watch only on the merits of the strangeness of its ability to exist, but in and of itself: not good."
551,"Love the show. At first I was a little confused, well I'm always confused after each episode because it makes you think. There are so many hidden jewels in the show and I'm glad I joined a FB group to help me see things more clearly."
552,"I held off after the first episode to review and said I'll give it two. I didn't like episode 2 at all and said I'll give it 3 before I review and here we are. So Atticus is a military Korean war vet who's just got home and decides to look for his father in the south. So you know this isn't going to go well because he's a black man. His uncle and childhood friend Letitia are along for the ride and there's monsters, ghosts and I don't know wtf happened in episode two. I am throwing it a seven because I enjoyed the first episode. Hated the second, but maybe when I understand more I'll feel different about it? Episode 3 was like a story from Tales From the Hood. Shut up. I liked that movie. The acting, camera work, setting are well done and Jurnee Smollett steals every scene she's in.
It's pretty violent and weird. I mean WEIRD! It goes episode 1 ""oh no! Racism""! ""Wait what""? Episode 2 ""HUH""? Episode 3 ""TALES FROM THE HOOD Y'ALL""!
Enjoy"
553,Brilliant & emotional ride. Leaves you hanging on edge waiting for the next episode.
554,Lovecraft Country successfully denounces H.P.'s racist past while acknowledging his contributions to weird horror. Characters to cheer for as well as well designed period sets. Some viewers may find the horror not scary enough - but sci-fi fans will enjoy all the tentacles and occult references. Very entertaining television to say the least.
555,"The first episode starts with a tease for what's likely to come in later episodes, but then gives us a long, slow, run of world building and character development/establishment. The last 10 minutes of the first episode give us what we've been waiting for with another peek at Lovecraftian horrors to tide us over until our next episode.Yesterday, the rating listed for this was a puzzling 5, but, I suspected, in today's divisive, political landscape with weaponized social media, that racist trolls were bad-review-flooding this amazing show because the main focal cast are people of color. This morning, however, the rating shown is more properly sitting above 8.I highly recommend giving this show some eyeballs. Maybe some will wait until the season is finished so as to binge it all in one go, but, I invite you to instead watch each episode as they come out, to give you time to chew on it, and build suspense about what's certainly to develop as the show does."
556,"How can this be rated lower than a 6 based on visuals alone ? Does it do the book justice ? Is it good all in it's own?
The first couple of episodes are great ! Now that alone can't make this a 3? What is happening to this site is there no more scoring rubrics ? It's bizarre , maybe I am completely out of touch
The characters are exceptional, and the acting. Episodes 3 on , could be some grainy video of guy doing push-ups in a basement I mean maybe that would take it to a six but that's not what happens.
A+ for effort"
557,"I loved this entire series! What a fantastic ride! The storyline, the special effects, the acting, everything!!!"
558,"I love it !! And i dont understand the haters!!!
Last episode explains everything and i like it !!"
559,"Never want this series to end! Casting is spot on! Direction/production/ music all brilliant. Issues surrounding discrimination against blacks is eye opening and takes you on an emotional journey with the characters. But also helps you try and understand what black people went through (are still going through). I was in tears after one of the episode and absolutely frightened after another! It's such a powerful masterpiece and has the ability to leave an impact on the viewer like most other series don't.And then there's the magic....!!Oh the magic !!! The twists, the plot line, the effects!! Wow oh wow! Wish this had 10 on imbd as it really deserves it. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL !! Never want it to end!!The prev reviewer who recommends to ignore 'extreme' reviews? Meh! I am not the middle of the line kinda person. I am not political (why do bozos always turn to politics for everything? Is nothing scared?) - I know an amazing piece of work when I see it. And if it's entertaining me and exciting me so why not?"
560,"So after 10 weeks the first season of the new show Lovecraft Country has finished and here is my review for it. The premise of the season sees a young African-American travel across the UK in the 1950's to find his missing Father.Main Character
Jonathan Majors who might be more busy in the future if reports that he will play Kang in the MCU plays Atticus the lead role here and he does a great job. It is just really easy to root for Atticus and it is interesting to see his character develop over the season and he is more then just your one dimensional hero and that makes him a worthy character here. Jurnee Smollett who played Black Canary in Birds of Prey plays Leti and she was the star of the show for me, she is just such a strong character and honestly she owns every scene that she is in. She is an interesting character and along with Atticus they are two great lead performers and really drag this show to a higher level.Supporting Characters
Michael Kenneth Williams is a great actor and he plays Montrose and he gives a really strong performance, there are elements of his character that don't quite work but Williams does a great job anyway and gives a really strong emotional performance. But I thought the rest of the supporting characters were really forgettable, whether it be the generic White female villain, or the supporting female cast that don't really have much to do, none of them were that interesting and the Majors, Smollet and Williams are carrying the show on their backs.Story
The story does some really good things, the show feels very brutal especially when it focuses on its racial tension that is here in force. But I also liked somewhat how this subject matter was well handled and was blended with Horror and Sci-Fi to make this show have a more unique feeling and more unique storytelling options then other shows that deal with racial inequality. But this show overreaches so heavily, it tries to do so much that it becomes hard to follow and over the top taking away from some of the great acting and great visuals. Elements of the story weren't necessary and it felt like they were just filling time because certain characters had to return later on in the season, which I also wasn't a huge fan of the ending of the season either.Script
The script has some really good and powerful dramatic moments, there is real emotion there and you actually will feel emotion towards elements of the show. But then there are some overly confusing things and clearly parts of the plot that the writers took less time and less effort with and it is very clear what those are.Style
The style has a huge budget behind it, you can tell HBO are looking for a Game Of Thrones replacement and there is no doubt that visually this show is brilliant and really impressive and add to the quality of the show. But the pacing is off, there are just too many episodes and too many story arcs that don't matter and could have been left on the cutting room floor which would have made the show much better.Overall
Overall, this is an average first season of this show. I feel like there is so much potential here and if there is a second season then that could be much better but as it stands the first season just isn't worth the time put into it."
561,Amazing show amazing cast!!! Definitely a good watch and definitely good to see poc being represented in shows!!
562,Can't wait for the rest of the season. First episode really sets up an interesting direction for the stories.
563,It's gonna kill me to wait for this on a week to week basis. Already completely obsessed with this show.
564,This show is really good. It combines fact and fiction into one really compelling storyline. It's reminds us how far we have come from the horrors of the Jim Crow era.
565,"When I saw lovecraft country pop up on HBO, I was honestly fearful that HBO was going to ruin another book with TV; I was way wrong.Now, I feel like it's important for the reader of this to understand a little bit about me.As much as I love HP lovecraft, he was extremely racist. And over the years I've ignored this fact because I like the content. In 2006 when lovecraft country came out, I thought it was a really cool idea to take something hateful and turn it into good content, while also spreading awareness. Overall, I don't find cosmic horror frightening, so it's enjoyable. Now, into how I feel about the show.In simple words, I love it. It had cosmic horror, and it actually makes me think and be aware of current culture and the BLM movement. I've never actually seen someone execute the whole ""monsters are bad, but humans are worse"" Theme properly until now. I wasn't expecting the level of race conflict in the show. I can never understand the fear and turmoil expressed by the protagonists because I'll never be in their shoes, similar to how it's difficult to relate to someone with PTSD without going through the same experience.Sounds dumb, but I felt the fear, the injustice, the anger with the content that was presented in the show. For those that haven't seen the show, the protagonists are African American/black and are set just after WW2 in an area of the US with extreme racism. Every single major scene, I was more worried about insane racism than I was about ""monsters"". Not only were the protagonist not treated as humans, it's like every single time they make progress, there was some racist person holding them back (antagonist) in a dehumanizing way.I honestly wish I could properly express my feelings while watching the show, the fear and anger I felt. Watch this show, it's important that you do."
566,This is everything the new series of Penny Dreadful should have been.
567,I don't think I've ever been more excited from a pilot episode! From the story line to the incredible acting I can not wait to see what's to come from this series!
568,"I'm leaving this review because I believe in the potential that the series has after the great impression I had of the first episode, and also because I saw several negative reviews, mainly about not lovingly adapting Lovecraft. Would they be uncomfortable with the approach to racism? Because the series is a direct adaptation of a novel of the same name (whose author is NOT Lovecraft) that addresses the same theme, then it is at least intriguing and curious this disappointment that some users have had. I will leave my complete analysis of the series when the season ends."
569,"First off, I love a series containing real-life themes/ situations, esp when a large amount of the population knows nothing of said situation(s)... with a twist of Sci-Fi!! The retro theme has me drooling, and is an added bonus, as are all the beautiful black actors. I cannot wait to see what happens on this series."
570,More sci-fi than I thought but love! Excellent casting as well
571,"I've been waiting for this show, and it did not disappoint!! This cinematography is outstanding, Jurnee Smollett looks fabulous and I'm excited to see where the storyline takes us >:)"
572,"Great show, especially for the black community! If I could give it 100 stars I would."
573,"There are very few shows that take so much care and research so many intricacies as LCC. I find myself reading syllabi after each episode to get history on all the things that happened in the episode.Black characters who are dynamic, smart, emotional, and authentic (not stereotypical). And don't get me started on production design and the writing. It's so smart and complex and every week there's something else to discover. Can we just talk about Jonathan Majors and Jurnee Smollett for a minute because they are grade A performers. Every character, in fact, provides a stellar performance every episode.I look forward to leaving the lights on after every episode because I know what I'm going to get is an excellently written, compelling story. More of this please."
574,"Outstanding Cast! Outstanding Storyline! Each episode has a perfect blend of Sci Fi, Horror and History. You'll feel like a detective trying to solve all the hidden imagery and symbolism before and after each episode. This series will have you in tears, laughing and smiling -- all during the same episode."
575,"Everything from the writing, the imagery, the characters, the acting, and the nuance are perfect. Jurnee Smollett is an absolute showstopper, and every episode is littered with historical references and Easter eggs you won't pick up on until your third or fourth watch. The characters are complex, intelligent, witty, and easy to root for. The villains are realistic and easy to hate. There is no other show on TV like this. A must-see."
576,"I had never heard of H.P. Lovecraft or Matt Ruff's book before learning about HBO's newest series ""Lovecraft Country"" so I had no idea of what to expect.I'm not generally a fan of Sci-Fi or Horror so initially I wasn't going to watch.But when I saw that Misha Green, Jordan Peele and JJ Abrams were involved, I decided to watch the first episode.I'm 4 episodes in and so glad that I decided to tune in!This show is amazing!! The story lines, the acting, the characters, the historical references, the costumes, the music and the poetry makes this a show like nothing I have ever seen before.And it keeps getting better! At the end of each episode I think ""well they can't top this one"". But then I watch the next episode and they do!Lovecraft Country is one the best things to happen in 2020!"
577,"There are many things at work in LCC. First of all, there is the homage to H.P. Lovecraft in small easter eggs if you are familiar with the author. Secondly, the Jim Crow issues seen in the series were indeed real issues for AfricanAmericans and what better way to explore those issues than with monsters. This series stimulates the brain, makes your heart jump out your chest and finally, creates dialogue. If you are a fan of Jordan Peele, sci-fi, gothic/horror genre, this is for you. And while some may say it's all over the place, everything connects if you pay attention."
578,"Sometimes I think there's so much good entertainment out there that we can get way too picky. I mean yes of course there's little things here and there, but come on, the show is brilliant. It's worth a watch just for the ""Whiteys on the moon"" scene alone.The show's got one layer of sheer entertainment, another layer of social commentary, and then I another layer just about common humanity and the human experience.I don't typically like horror. But I would say the horror here is along the lines of Stranger Things or A Quiet Place- Not too bad. But the critical thing here is that they are using the horror genre to highlight the actual horrors in our culture. Excellent."
579,"HBO's newest series launched to a strong start, led by a trio of powerful performances from Jonathan Majors, Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Courtney B. Vance. A story of family unspools against the backdrop of 1950s America, fervently brought to life with a poignant attention to detail, integrating historical iconography to make the setting feel all the more real. So effectively real, in fact, that the show has proven intensely frightening long before the first monsters ever show themselves on screen, as our heroes fight to survive against the terrors of racism, made all the more horrific by being all too real. From the few glimpses seen so far, the cosmic side of this story will prove just as compelling, as we only begin to follow the Freeman family into the spiralling world of mystery."
580,Have been waiting for a decent script rather a gradual drawl that takes you into a world of HPL. It's tricky when you have so many twists in darkness to make a real attempt at a balanced narrative. Great character buildup & love the chemistry.. decent production & great makeup Monster effects... been waiting a while since Supernatural & Castle Rock.. don't rush lovecraft country.
581,I'm starting at a 10 because I was VERY entertained in this first episode and I'm excited to see where it goes!!
582,Stranger things but the adult version . HP would approve !
583,Great adaptation of Matt ruff's novel. Does an excellent job exposing the insidious ways in which racism haunts the lives of black American.
584,"A blend of six-fi, southern gothic, with the horror of the Jim Crow south. Episode 1 starts off with pedal to the metal and doesn't let up. It's so good! I cannot wait for the rest of the season 🙌🏿"
585,"I'm really disappointed in so called fans of Lovecraftian horror coming in and giving this 1/10. The book has been out since 2016 and if you've read it you'd know the title ""Lovecraft Country"" to be a derogatory term used to conjure the spirit of white supremacist 1950s. Both book and show does its own thing and does it good. If you fail to recognize that, you might just be a bigot yourself, or have a hard time accepting the complex nature of liking Lovecraftian stories."
586,"Hot on the heels of last years stellar WATCHMEN sequel comes another genre-bending story that pairs timely themes with pulp trappings. While this story centers very heavily on race and racism (which makes for incredibly uncomfortable but very essential viewing, especially at this particular moment in history) the genre elements on display in Lovecraft Country are weird and wild in all the ways that will have fantasy/sci-fi/horror geeks like myself buzzing with excitement.Come for the gore, the monsters and the magic, but stay for the fully defined characters, the topical and well-explored themes, and a powerful story of family at the core of this wild, wonderful series.HP is spinning in his grave because of this series, and I mean that as the highest of praise. Welcome to your new Sunday night obsession."
587,"I never leave reviews. However, this show is absolutely Amazing. Misha Green truly captures the essence of our history while incorporating the sci-fi aspect. I cannot wait for a Second Season!"
588,"As a wholehearted lover of this genre, I was besides myself when I heard rumors of such a show being in the works. I waited patiently and man did the wait pay off. Do not let the negative reviews deter you from trying it out for yourself. To be honest, most of them are from history revisionists who ""dislike how White Americans are being portrayed"", Lovecraftian purists and viewers who have a strong disdain of any form of socio-political commentary ""tainting"" their sources of entertainment. That being said, the show is beautifully paced and the various branches of each subplot tie in almost perfectly with the primary storyline. So that being said, if you are a die hard Lovecraftian, before you watch this you need to accept and understand that this is MIsha Green's creative take, or if you prefer, reimagination of Matt Ruff's book. Once you do, you are in for a treat."
589,This show is awesome!! One of the things I love the most is the unwhitewashed history of the show! The action and the depth of the show will have you hanging on to the edge of your seats! Great job writers and actors!!! I LOVE THIS SHOW!!
590,"I did not read the book,but I do love the depth of the content and am in love with black sci fi and the conversations and sense of whimsy we get when we don't get it often. This is unprecedented in the quality of production, effort, screenwriting, and overall consideration presented for something so significant. I love the pacing, the quality of production lighting especially for black skin, all of the educational tools and ode to not only black history but black cinema. I appreciate its inclusivity of all backgrounds that are integral to society but treated as adverse. It is great to see strong black leads and such justice done to lore. I appreciate and love the producers, directors, and team being well represented. I shorted it a star because it can sometimes be tremendously overwhelming, almost in a disconnected sense. I almost have to disassociate in the middle of it to process. I also have a thing about the black leads always having a representation of blacker features with a lighter woman, its unnecessary to continue perpetuate especially when this is sci fi/horror"
591,"This show is awesome, well written, well thought out, well acted and amazing. You really have to digest it and watch it twice to see it all. The historical aspect is so true to now. It is very uncomfortable but uplifting at the same time. Sad only 2 episodes left for this season."
592,"I look forward to this show every week. Not only does it possess magic and hellish creatures, but it depicts the historical horrors of Jim Crow America. This was the reality of my elders, and the aftermath still lingers today. This show will make people upset that are not willing to understand that reality, but that pales in comparison to the plight of BIPOC, who are unable to deny their past.
Every episode is a surprise. I definitely get creeped out! It's refreshing to see a diverse cast in this genre and with complex characters. As a Black woman, this representation means a lot to me and the show speaks to me on another level."
593,"If you're like me and don't know who/what lovecraft is and you don't care about political and social viewpoints, you might enjoy it.I say ""might"" because it's a weird story rolled up in a hot mess of genres, which might turn some off the show.I understand if some people don't find it to be their cup of tea, but I also think it must suck to be someone who despises it.Personally, it's 10/10 because I find that it's creative, weird, different and nothing like any show released in 2020."
594,"This show is nicely done with decent production values, great music and so excellent horror.It's a bit early to say much more than that, but it has promise.With regard to many of the low-scoring reviews, I knew Lovecraft was foully racist of course but I'm disappointed to see so many of his current fans appear to be as well. They need to read some history as well as cosmic horror and understand what a racist cesspit the USA was and sadly often still is. Facts don't care about your feeling boys. Maybe you need to address your own irrational fears and anxieties about difference."
595,"I'm hooked after watching the first episode, this show is intense!!!"
596,"If you want a show to challenge you mentally? This is the one! Each episode is like a piece of a puzzle. Many wow, WTH! , and crazy moments. The cinematography, special effects, and acting is awesome. The music and props feel like I'm really connecting with the scene. One episode literally gave me chills! LCC takes place in the era of the 50s. Mix of horror and showcase real life scenarios of racism. This is the type of show that back in the day wouldn't never be aired on TV. So yes you may feel very uncomfortable. It will make you acknowledge racism. If you feel some type of way about this show. Ask yourself why? It's mind boggling and I think about this show often. I'm not a fan of horror or sci-fi. The writing and creativity of this show is phenomenal. Pure genius! LoveCraft Country challenges me to think outside the box. Sometimes I finish an episode and feel lost. Like I said the episodes is fitting together pieces to a puzzle. You will have that AHA moment. Thrilling and exciting and at times emotionally wrenching. I look forward to Sunday. Love this show!"
597,"... even though this is an HBO show. This feels almost like it belongs on UPN or one of those other channels geared towards the young adult crowd. I mean, seriously- remove/edit the sex scenes & I think this could be on those networks. I was so excited for this show. The 1st episode was ok. It went downhill from there. Episode 3 was almost there. Like, if you were disappointed by the Hunger Games because you were a fan of Battle Royale because you knew Hunger Games's potential if it WASN'T for young adults. Lovecraft Country seems like it's almost there but something is holding the darkness back. If the color schemes, shadows, and horror elements were darker (in color & tone), this would help this should significantly. As the racial themes in this movie are about breaking boundaries, whatever is holding this show back from reaching its full potential needs to end. I give this show another to puck up because I really want this to work (I don't think it will though). Disappointing."
598,"While off to a slow start in the first half of the first episode, the incredible chemistry between the actors helped establish the world and the tale being told, and I can't wait to see how the plot builds on itself. A solid foundation has been built. Very timely & very well written!"
599,"If your undecided, you need to get off the fence and you need to watch this.
CAN. NOT. WAIT. FOR. THE. NEXT. EPISODE!!!!"
600,"It's not a show for everyone. If your mind only moves in first and second gear then honestly it's not for you. I think that it does a fine job of pointing out a dark time when segregation existed. It gives a great view of how dark that era was. Hopefully people will look at it and take the positive from it and say okay we don't need to repeat that. Your brain has to digest each episode to put this puzzle together. Then you realize it's not a puzzle. You can't put it together so just enjoy the show. This show is the epitome of HBO's slogan ""It's not TV it's HBO"""
601,Season 1 (4.5 out of 5 stars).Lovecraft Country is a thrilling horror series that focuses on an era where racial profiling and prejudices was the issue. The season builds up the intensity with the characters facing against racism. White supremacy groups. And while dealing with a plot that is so much more in depth. Without giving away spoilers. Yes. There is monsters. Godlike beings. Magic. And a bit of time travelling. The season does a great job in storytelling and handling it all. Great scripts and direction that adds some surprises. And emotional character arcs. The cast ensemble was great.The season could have been so much more before concluding too quick.
602,I was looking forward to the second episode but when I saw the monsters it reminded me of Stranger Things 🙁. I continued watching up until the last 30 minutes of the 9th episode.This show was not scary and also not enticing.It does not make me want to read the book.
603,Awesome show. I really admire the way it has been directed with such a wonderful cast
604,"It starts well, immersing itself in the perpetual racial struggle for equality in the United States, in the continuous persecution of African-Americans and in the division of a country through the color of their skin.
It loses a little when it comes time to feed the Lovecraft universe, insisting on visiting common places, clichés and visual fuss without great content.
The dialogues are sometimes boring and some characters are very poor.
The soundtrack is absolutely appalling and has nothing to do with the period of time they are living.
Without being terrible, it is just entertainment that will be forgotten as quickly as it was seen."
605,"I love this show! It doesn't follow the book exactly but the differences totally work. Previously, I was not a fan of Ms. J. Smollet and her over acting but she seems to have grown as an actress...she's awesome in this. She gives the right amount of drama, humor and seriousness in each of her screens. The entire cast is great. I'm so happy Mr. Peele is part of bringing this book to tv... well done! I'm looking forward to the rest of the season."
606,"...we get only mediocre tv shows.
Boring start, random events that should be meaningful.
But most of all i hate it if thats how thing really were at that time. oh,yes. theres monsters now and action. nice."
607,Hands down THE best show of 2020. its indiana jones meets harry potter. Incredible fun from start to finish. ESSENTIAL VIEWING
608,"One of the most amazing show that is so well put together! I'm not a fan of Sci fi, or at least I thought! It starts off with the first episode mysterious and needing more explanations. Then suddenly boom! It happens. You're in the edge of your seat in suspense and terrified but can't close your eyes cause you don't want to missing nothing! This show brings out some historical facts that people are scared to talk about because.... well I'll let you figure that one out. Bravo cast and team! Well done!"
609,I love this show I watch it over and over just to see what I missed the first time I watched it! Don't blink you might miss something important! This is the only time my cellphone is down!! Lol love tic love leti!! Love the whole storyline and how real this is!!
610,"At first I didn't understand where it was going but it's very interesting. I think Jordan Peele is doing a great job with urban horror. I feel like he is giving us what we could never get years ago. It's interesting bc it's set in the late 50s but it's very well put together. If you like the movie Get Out, you'll like it. I don't know much about the writer Misha Green but this series is great!!! Take a chance for yourself in watching this show bc it's different but good and there were alot of negative reviews."
611,Episode 1 was really promising. I lost all the guts watching episode 2... couldnt get through it
612,"Series starts off slow. But it starts to get interesting after the second episode. Entertaining to say the least. I've read multiple reviews for this show that seem to share a similar sentiment; ""racism is political"". Most people who feel this way haven't experienced it, nor do they want to understand it. They don't want to see it, and quite frankly they wish people would shut up about it. So images of 50's Chicago may make them uncomfortable. This is all I can garner from the poor ratings given to an otherwise entertaining show."
613,Loved it. Its tells it like it is and was. It's not meant for everybody and we all know what I mean. It'll reach the people it's meant to reach and that's all that important.
614,"I have seen almost all shows that fall under horror/mystery or scifi. This one just made me wait in anticipation for the next episode like no other. When seen so many horror movies and shows (also read a ton), it is quite hard to find something you are surprised by. That actually was what impressed me the most. Even for the ultimate horror nerd, there was a lot that came ""out of the blue"". At least up until the last two episodes, but thats understandable, cuz it had to built up to the conclusion.
I hope with all of my heart this will get another season. These days there are so many different shows and so few that make it further than 1 or 2 seasons. Thank god it isnt on Netflix (if u dont know what I mean, do a little research on their algorythm)."
615,It's been a long time since a show grabbed my attention and held it so intensely. Lovecraft Country is a gem. Great writing with even better performances. Each episode has it's own flavor as it delves into history and the supernatural. So much care and intention went into it.
616,Great show. Looking forward to see if there's a season 2.
617,"Lovecraft Country is a breath of fresh air. The character development is amazing, excellent set/costume design, and flawless performances. I'm totally in love with it!!"
618,This show has so many layers. i love them all. every week feels like a season finale. the hidden gems and stories in each episode is mind blowing. i'm obsessed with the storyline and the performances of these amazing actors and actresses. this show is a must see hands down! my favorite!
619,He really did this show justice! I love the actors that play the characters. They really bring the story to life for me!
620,This is such an entertaining show. I love the storyline and characters. Its definitely one of the best adventures on television.
621,"This show is amazing. The anticipation weekly for the new episode to arrive is intense on my end. Rich with history, which may not resonate with others but definitely does with me . I'm hoping there will be a second season and would be extremely disappointed if not renewed."
622,"I gave this a few weeks before starting it. The first episode draws you in with the beginning. Introducing aliens and then turning towards the community, character introductions, and the rampant racism of the time. Terrifying episode.Episode 2 though... I'm left a bit speechless. It started out slow and I kept waiting for something to develop. Nope. It went downhill fast. Honestly, it's going to be a chore to even turn on episode 3 at this point. At times it seemed like it was playing off American Gods, but just so much weaker(and I didn't like American Gods after season 1)."
623,"There is very little that captures my attention when it comes to tv shows. One of the major issues I have is that im very timid into putting the time into one, to only be met with dissapoint by the third episode from something so frivolous, But this is different. From the very second it started, I knew I was going to love it until the very end. I love everything about it; from the plot, characters, history etc. To me this one is HBO's winner (sorry GOT)"
624,This Show is amazing how it started in the first episode.. the cast is very good ..want to see more episodes really badly.. Hope people will support this Show cuz you will know when you watch the first episode. Lovecraft Country.
625,Looking pretty good so far! Can't wait for the next episode!
626,Cosmic horror mixed with Jim Crow era setting with the HP Lovecraft ambiguity and subtext of racism! 👏🏿very 👏🏿 here 👏🏿 for 👏🏿 it 👏🏿!!
627,"This was a fantastic series, from start to finish. I started having doubts during the third episode, but stayed with it, and am glad I did.I have not read the novel this is taken from, but am glad, because I had no expectations,The cast were superb, and the story was excellent. I am assuming the ""normal"" events portrayed are historical, or based on them (I am Australian, and do not have a great knowledge of American, let alone Black-American history).The true horror, for me, is how non-white people were treated (and still are treated, to this day, sadly). It pleases me that the heroes of the piece are all black Americans, something Lovecraft would find abhorrent, as he believed all non-whites to be sub-human.Everything in this show was top-notch: acting, story, sets, costumes, effects, etc. Even the use of contemporary music in places, which I found jarring in the first instance, but it seemed so naturally appropriate, thereafter.I hope this is not a ""one-and-done"" show. I don't know if the author wrote any subsequent books in this setting, but I think it deserves to be explored further, especially in light of how this season ended.I have to give this a 10/10."
628,Absolute brilliance from the first episode. The extreme racism mirrored with old school sci-fi horror is incredible. Very well acted and written story.
629,"I don't really understand how people are giving below 5 stars, they haven't even completed the whole season yet, also it is one of them programmes that if you don't understand you won't get it and think the ""concept"" isn't good, I think it's fantastic and gripping, maybe reviews should be thought about before submitting them. at least complete the season first :)"
630,Just finished episode three of this new series and I'm impressed beyond impressed. I've watchEd science fiction shows since I was 5 and this is something both new and innovative. It's sucks that a Black starring Cast in a science fiction show is innovative it shouldn't have taken this long but the universe has a way of making everything make sense. No one but Jordan Peele could pull this off in the classic yet culturally pushing way. It's quality and the story line is very real and true to its genre. This isn't some basic vampires and witches show. This has multi layered depth. If they stay on this path they will change the game and challenge these lazy writers to step their game up!
631,"HBO just won the sci-fi war. This is better than every episodes of that child's play of a show.This is unique, creative and intelligent. HBO has another classic in its hands. It's so good I've seen it twice already. The start was a little slow but nonetheless amazing job.I'll be back October 18th 2020 after the season finale. Bravo HBO. Best thing since Chernobyl."
632,The cabin scene was so funny that I shed tears of laughter. I can't wait for episode two. Those damn flares came in handy.
633,This show is so good! Had me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait until next week.
634,"This is superb TV, I will be rewatching this many times.
The most frightening thing was the racism and Jim Crow era it's depicted in. It's genuinely terrifying.
I have not read the book, but so much (if not all) of recent horror is influenced by Lovecraft's work, I can appreciate they have taken free reign with the Loveicraft Universe.
I think it was an interesting move personally. No chance of overkill. Always getting surprised. Fantastic.
The acting is all superb. Not not actor falls short. (Majors) Tic, smoulders like a young Brando, but better. Abbey Lee is like a graceful, cool femme fatale.
Writing is complex and engaging.
A sining star of 2020 TV, I was blown away."
635,"As a black woman and ardent fan of sci-fi, fantasy and horror books, movies, and shows, this series has everything! The historical fiction with historical fact woven throughout, gives it serious gravitas. Something I don't think has been done before.The fact that the non-magical atrocities were real happenings, including the medical experimenting on vulnerable men, women and children...I get all my entertainment fixes, and heavy doses of introspection. (I FEEL parts Hippolyta's story so much.)I need to make sure I have some convos and document with my 75yo father on what things were like for him in that time period (he was 8 and in the South in 1955) and in his teens and young adulthood during the fight against segregation and it's attending evils. I wish my great uncle was still alive to speak to. He was one of the leaders of the Freedom Riders in the 60s.The middle finger to HP Lovecraft by the book's author and the show runners is delightful.Will be doing several rewatches with syllabus in hand, Easter Eggs investigated, and podcast listened to!This show is a magnum opus *for those able to digest and follow.*I encourage all proponents as well as THE NAYSAYERS to converse with their elders who were alive then."
636,"So far I'm on episode S1E05. THe storyline is good, interesting and effects are excellent. However, every episode feels like it goes on forever. For an hour long episode, the dialogue is stretched and I feel like there is just way too much unnecesary scenes. It gets better towards the end of each episode, the last 20 minutes are always good but the series are just way too long."
637,So I'm not one who loves scary movies but I truly enjoy Jordan Peele's work. He seems to be able to create movies that gets you thinking about something deeper. So I read about Lovecraft and who he was. So now I understand why this show is set in this period and confronts acts of racism and hate. People need to be honest about American history and who people were and are. I really loved this show! I think it's very well done and it will definitely be a Sunday must watch for me.
638,This is so good. Love it. Absolutely must watch for die hard goonies fans.
639,"Interestingly unique show that is a mix of an evil dark Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, Kill Bill and real life history of Black Americans. This show gives you a look into how Black Americans have been treated over the years; their fears, wants and uses famous quotes to express themes throughout the episodes.
(I haven't read the book it's based on and really liked it)."
640,"Full of historical references, drama, and sci fi. Some scenes are hard to watch but I can't stop looking! We watch this show as a family every Sunday night. I am already looking forward to season 2. The writers have done an amazing job!"
641,It's filled with scenes that keep you wondering. The plot thickens on a weekly basis. The acting is phenomenal.
642,"The complexities of the characters are so good. American history references are exceptional throughout each episode. They took the time to cover so much untapped history. Every Sunday, I'm stuck in front of my television, awaiting the next episode. I love how they show the strength and delicateness of black women."
643,"A brilliant and intriguing show which is full of unpredictable twists and turns. You may need to hang in there for 3-4 episodes to really understand the depth and meaning behind the story telling. It's not just a sci-fi and horror series. This show will give you a glimpse into some of the horrors of racism in the segregation era. Sci-fi and history are intricately woven together. Each character is on a journey of finding themselves in this bleak world. The episodes which showed histories cruelty bought tears to my eyes. The journeys of each character felt spiritual and insightful. People who are downrating this show seem to have a problem with acknowledging the racism and prejudice shown in this show. Given the current climate in the world right now, they could do with opening their eyes... but most likely never will."
644,"""Lovecraft Country"" (2020 release; 10 episodes of about 60 min. each) brings the story of Atticus. As Episodes 1 opens, he is having a fantastical dream sequence (turns out he is having a nap while on a bus ride towards his hometown of Chicago). Meanwhile we get to know a married couple in Chicago, Atticus' aunt and uncle. We are sometime in the 1950s. They write travel guides for ""safe negro travel"". Upon arriving in Chicago, Atticus explains that his dad sent him a strange note: his dad is off to Massachusetts to dig into the family's ""secret legacy"", without elaborating. Atticus, his uncle, and his childhood friend Leti decide to take a road trip to Massachusetts... At this point we are 10 min. into Episode 1.Couple of comments: this is the TC adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name a few years ago. I haven't read the graphic novel so I can't comment how closely the TV series sticks to the underlying material. This TV series is very much the brainchild of Micha Green, who developed and produced it (Jordan Peele and J.J. Abrams executive-produced). The series' opening episode turns out to be a harrowing experience as we see America's pandemic racism fully is display, where blacks literally fear for their lives with each interaction with whites. There are several scenes of that in Episode 1 that are beyond description. And then, in the concluding 10-15 min. of Episode 1, there is a healthy dose of the supernatural thrown in here (I won't go into further details, sorry). It all leaves us the viewers with a potential lethal cocktail of racism and the supernatural that will leave you gasping for air at the conclusion of Episode 1. It left me wanting for more, and I cannot wait to see Episode 2 and additional future episodes. The production set and value in this series is absolutely top-notch, and clearly money was not a concern or restriction. Jonathan Majors (as Atticus) and Jurnee Smollett (as Leti) are outstanding in the lead roles.""Lovecraft Country"" premiered this past weekend on HBO, and Episode 1 is now available on HBO On Demand, Amazon Instant Video, and other streaming services. New episodes air on Sunday evening at 9 pm Eastern. By the looks of it, this is going to be a fabulous series going forward. Can't wait to see how it all is going to shake out. If you have any interest in either race relations in this country and/or the supernatural, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion."
645,I love the dichotomy presented that allows you to enjoy this show and at the same time... Be terrified!!
646,Infact do people even read anymore? Because this series is based on the Novel Lovecraft County by Matt Ruff. It's a fiction novel that focuses on racial tensions in the 1950's. It is not based on Lovecrafts novels. The series sticks really close to the original source material so far and is actually really an excellent read. Stop making reviews before doing your research please. You may actually enjoy this series once you realize that.
647,"It's been a long time since I've been pulled into a movie, let alone a television show, that is as spooky as this first episode.I don't know much about H.P. Lovecraft, but if his books inspired this episode, I could be a fan."
648,"I loved this series from beginning to end and was always looking forward to the next episode. Now that it has completed its season finale you can stream the entire season and not have to wait a week for the next episode. I love stories that make you think instead of spoon feeding you everything. This is they type of series where discussing the series with others adds great value since you cannot catch everything during the first viewing. You will find yourself going back and reviewing a previous episode for confirmation and saying ""aha, I missed that""! I hope there is a season 2!!"
649,Great show must watch. Outstanding historical references and great play on thec as authors books
650,"Lovecraft Country is truly an unexpected treat. It pushes the boundaries of sci-fi, thriller, and action, with just the right touch of drama and romance. Not to mention all of the hidden history gems that really gives viewers an interesting twist on perspectives. One of the few shows that I can rewatch frequently and be entertained each time."
651,"I've watched every episode at least 4 times. This show is very powerful for Black people and it is veryyy different from what our community is used to when it comes to TV series. By the way it isn't only for Black people, everyone can enjoy it:)"
652,"If you don't love this show honey I don't know what the hell is wrong with you. The imagination, the historical content on race for African Americans during the 50s in the North has truly opened my eyes. So refreshingly scary, adventurous and crazy. Watch it with an open mind and I guarantee it will leave you wanting more ! If not you just boring as hell."
653,Fun!!! Don't get too serious about a show that is just good craic.
654,"Which got off rails in season 3 with all the cgi monsters. So this is a knock off of looking for a missing person but in the 50's with black people? There is enough fairy, dragon, monster, demon, angel, vampire stuff out there."
655,"I have never seen something so unpredictable, so graphic, and so interesting in a long while. This show is everything you would not expect it to be. I love how they have made racism and Jim crow a sci fi thriller, so much so, it almost gives racism the proper label and explanation. An evil driven by a supernatural, magical, spiritual force. I so anticipate where this show us headed."
656,"I love this series. It's a combination of genres. As someone who typically don't drawn to sci-if, this show definitely has got my attention. I recommend watching. Good job Misha Green!"
657,"I love this show! I wasn't sure what to expect but from the first episode this show has had my attention and every week it's the only show I watch when it airs, the story line, the characters, the effects! You have to watch."
658,This show has Lovecraft roll over in his grave in the most brilliant ways possible! The writers and historians of Lovecraft country BRILLIANTLY merged historical facts with science fiction and horror. The depths of the rabbit holes this show sends you are undesirable. A MUST WATCH!
659,"This show is excellent! The acting, writing and directing are superb! It's a great blend of history, suspense, and science-fiction. As someone said, this show is like a puzzle. You have the pieces but you don't have the picture as a guide. Open your mind and let the pieces fit together. BTW, this is NOT based on the works of H.P. Lovecraft as some reviewers think. It's based on a book by Matt Ruff. Google it!"
660,"It is amazing to see a story that gives complexity to the black experience in America. The way the show intertwines history and fantasy and grounds it in a story that is about relationships that Lina rooted in family and community. Every week I am blown away by how themes are layered into each episode and still manages to give us horror! Best show out right now, hands down. Give everyone their flowers because the acting is always on point."
661,I love everything about this show. I'm not huge in sci-fin and i almost quit watching after the first episode. Boy am i glad i kept watching. This show much deeper than science fiction.
662,Love this show...so well done. Hits on sensitive subjects in such a great way
663,I love this show and have watch episodes more than once on multiple occasions.
664,This show has so much historical content . I can't get enough of it the acting is amazing . This show tackles many of the racial issues we deal with today. Not to mention the black genre of horror.
665,Just more social justice nonsense. The acting is decent but storyline is boring and predictable which is a shame the series could have been really awesome.
666,"Ok trolls we see you, and we also see what you are trying to do here, now before you try to portray this show as anti white get this in your head. THEY ARE ONLY SHOWING WHAT YOUR NATION's HISTORY IS. Its simple as that. Learn from it and make sure it doesnt happen again rather trying to defame a great piece of work.
Peace"
667,"This show was great simple OK, some parts were slow but overall a good show don't know why the trolls are hating on it could it be cause of Peele being coloured? Hmm"
668,"I don't normally 2atch horror, but this show is a masterpiece well worth watching!I don't think I have ever seen a show so deeply layered, authenticallly Black and entertainingI have literally had goosebumps at some point in every episode! Queen sugar is excellent. The Get Down is solid. Luke Cage is good. This is Us comes close. But EVERY episode making us FEEL this crazy ride of such extreme highs and lows, joys and pains in each diverse episode? Literal goosebumps!I love lines like these from episode 2:""You know who you are... Don't ever let them make you question yourself. That's how they win. They want to make us crazy, terrorize us, make us scared.What I know is that our destinies are not decided by our fathers or grandfathers...The smallest most inconsequential thing can take you on a new course. You just have to see it and seize it.""And the show prominently features the work of James Baldwin, Nina Simone and Gil Scott Heron??? It's a winner on ALL fronts! Highly recommended, if you can handle the spooky violence."
669,It's a show that you get hooked on from the first episode. Exceptional writing. Exceptional weaving of history into storylines. Unique storylines. Just love it.
670,"If you're atleast part of any struggle as a minority in this fd up world then rate based on your factual knowledge on black oppression and the magic that exists within us as human beings.Also most of these stupid low ratings are by kids who aren't aware of what truly exists.This series is going to be a mind f of beauty created by magicians like Misha Green, JJ Abrams and Jordan Peele who have added their own ingredients to this dish."
671,"Good (but worn out) premise with great promise, but horrible execution
Watched the entire season, the only point I see this trying to make is Black man good, White man Bad! Quite literally the worst tv show of the year"
672,"In my humble opinion, the 2D collage is one of the most difficult art forms to consistently succeed at. One of the reasons is because when a collage is done right, it immediately speaks to viewer, first through form, which allows a deeper dive into the content. But what is important is that immediate, intuitive understanding that comes when viewing a well made collage. I think it comes from the artist's perspective as well as their design skill.Enter Lovecraft Country - a mishmash of many references. Do all the pieces fit together? Absolutely not. But I will admit it is amazing how Lovecraft Country maintains pace and entertainment. But this is through well conceived individual scenes. I would contend that the attempt to collage together all the collected ideas, stories, genres, times, characters, plights, victories and mysticism do not fit together. I feel many of the CGI effected outdoor shots, that are supposed to look like an era from the past, are perfect metaphors for this show. While they arguably do make visual sense - they're just not right.But I like this show! When the horror comes, it really is fun! Awesome monsters, devilish antagonists, spectacular gore, and really good production values to bring it all together. While I haven't read the book that this show is based upon, I have read a lot of HP Lovecraft (I was also very pleased to hear a Clark Ashton Smith name drop). As far as I can tell, Lovecraft is only used in this TV show as a loose idea involving occult type horror. There is very little specificity outside of pointing out a particularly unsavory poem penned by Lovecraft, that really isn't explored in any meaningful way. One could argue... One could argue damn near anything due to the hodgepodge of material.What is funny is as a representation of classic horror from the mind of HP Lovecraft, I thought this show failed. In exploring Lovecraft the man and his predilections? Failed. Successful execution of collage like film structure? Nope! But surely I liked some of the characters? eh... not really! And then there is the very end of the last episode where the content truly takes a blatant $#!t on any attempt at art. This doesn't invalidate the entire show, but it isn't a great way to end a season.But I still liked it overall, and would recommend it to anyone who asked. It is very entertaining, has excellent, well conceived scenes in various types of situations, and has a lot of fun adventure! But I can't recommend taking the content too seriously, out of imo, a lack of merit."
673,"It was so promising. I could feel the facial stereotypes crumbling to the ground. Then somewhere around episode 5, the stupid began to overcrowd it. By 7, I wondered what the writers had been smoking. I'm hoping to make it to 10 just because I'm not a quitter."
674,"I liked the show a fair amount. I was looking forward to it for the last 3 years when I heard it was coming. But I was obviously expecting way more considering its titular connection to the now widely regarded as fantastic eldritch horror and magic genre that us called ""Lovecraftian"".
Jordan Peele was involed, which, considering the solid focus upon the black experience throughout the first half of the 20th century, was still an odd choice. But not surprising. The man has reached acclaim beyond his great comedy writing and acting due to films like ""Get Out"", which was okay but abysmally predictable, even as a supposed social commentary, which I half believe. Peele was more known for his far better ""horror"" film titled ""Us. That was a fun one to behold.
Yet even with all that under his belt the show is, like just about all the shows I have seen on HBO over 30 years...somewhat disappointing. Again I enjoyed parts of it fer sure, one or two episodes were really cool and enthralling. But the show is not meant to be exactly or even mostly like true Lovecratian. Remotely is certainly shares much with its elements of magic, ancient beyond belief and cultish dark intentions, etc etc. Though what some may find the hinderance regarding its overuse of racial perspectives and narratives, I actually find the premise from said point of view interesting. You see in the actual Lovecraft Mythos, the main characters are overwhelmingly all white people. Whether in the 19th century or the 1920s throughout most of the 20th century, when not faced with magical or unnatural horrors, there was no danger present.
But enter a predominantly african american group of main characters that is large and somewhat complex for their time period, and you have danger without need of dark gods, monsters or evils beyond time. Sure a character can go on a bit of an adventure, but since they are obviously looking at things from the black perspective, as soon as the mystical journey or things is over and done-time to come back to the real world. Where for many people, the monsters were just most other people. The irony abounds when you think about it from this point of view.
But then the show often takes far too long to get the ball rolling on most anything. Many a time I was groaning about tedious little things and nuances that were portrayed as being pivotal to the plot, but just served to lessen the pulse of the shows pace. Too often there was pointless focus on weird almost 4th wall breaking reactions or literally staring at the camera when no actual character was present in the show. There was a complete backtracking of things that HBO is known to shamelessly be famous for such as sex scenes that are hardly even soft core worthy, yet they are SHOVED into peoples faces again and again. After a point, why do it again? We know, get to the real meat and good stuff. ANd I am a straight male saying this. There was just too much that erked me that could have been done so much better. But perhaps this was all simply setting things up so the future season or seasons can really bring home the gold. And please ditch the modern music that always pops up in the show. Its so disappointing and immersion breaking that it just dulls the shows pacing and impact. STOP IT!
But will it happen? What with the monstrous things ever occurring within our own reality, and the dangers from pandemics or war, or famine and any number of other tragedies...will there be a tomorrow, let alone for such average to okay forms of entertainment?
People are gonna start making harder choices about what to frit their money and time away upon. Hopefully if the show does continue, Peele actually tries his hardest, and focuses solely upon the shows plot and substance. I get it he has his comedy duo and other films and projects like the new Twilight Zone...but you cannot spread yourself so thin or else your endeavors will amount to little. 6 out of 10 for the show at best, but really could have bee so so much better. And without giving spoilers, I just cant go into further detail. Decide for thine self."
675,I really love the creativity of the show. It keeps me entertained and on my toes. Give me season 2!
676,"The first episode had me disinterested. But my dad told me to give it another try and by episode 2 I was hooked. There is so much going on in each episode you have to be up to date on history and spiritual practices outside the norm ontop of the fictional story line. This is extremely well written and produced so muxh as to the music isn't just a place filler for silence or to hype a scene it actually plays and goes into what is to come next or later in the show. The art in the background gives clues, the clothes the actors wear resemble the era the show is in and certain points in history but also tye I to the characters. I love this show!"
677,"I love this show! Full of twist and turns. It includes actual historical events and it keeps you guessing, never know what's coming next. The story is confusing at first but then it explains things in a series of backstories concerning each character."
678,"Poignant show that crosses of so much of what I look forward to in great television. Story line, writing, acting all powerful. Representation matters and it's amazing going on this adventure with these characters!"
679,LCC is an awesome show..Indiana Jones with Horror mixed in... And we cant forget the real live history it mixes into the show.... If you blink youll miss those facts.. Yes it gives a glimpse of Americas racist history and that makes the show even more interesting..
680,So... the other person that took the time to review this show is wrong. Ten stars. That's it. That's the review.
681,Dope story dope visuals beautifully acted man they are off with a bang
682,"Such a great story line from the very beginning. It made you want to go back and look at episode over and over again to make sure that you are keeping with all of the action.
I love how they tied up all of the loose ends during the finale as well. This was such a great episode that I can't be mad about wanting more."
683,"This show is Stranger Things meets Jim Crow. This is not based on HP Lovecraft's work. This is an adaptation of Matt Ruff's book in response to HP Lovecraft's racism. If your going to leave a review, at least know what you're talking about. This show is full of hidden gems, magic, and action packed. If you don't understand it, then perhaps it isn't for you. Black horror is on the rise and I'm loving every minute with having black characters at the forefront. Perhaps, a certain demographic doesn't like it, because it's like looking at a reflection. I highly recommend reading the book and watching the show. It's so much raw talent that tackles many issues that are relevant today."
684,"It's really a good show that combines, Drama, sci-fi, horror, thriller, action in one dramatic show, rarely you can see that in series"
685,This waa the show I didn't know I needed in my life!!!
686,"I'm not usually into Sci-Fi or horror, but this has captured my attention and kept me coming back anxiously anticipating the next episode. I love the elements of history intertwined into the show. The storyline & plot keep you in the edge of your seat! I pray they have a 2nd season!"
687,One of the best shows of 2020. This show is different and unexpected! Lovecraft Country is unpredictable and keeps me coming back for more! Everyone should watch this show!
688,"This show combines horror with history. Wonderful acting....Episode 8 was excellent! Not a boring moment. You won't understand it, if you know nothing about the book. Can't wait for season 2."
689,"Finally a show that is right on time!! The book was amazing but the show is even better! Absolutely no one is exempt from watching this show. Is it going to make emotional?? Absolutely, but worth every emotion and third eye opening moment. EVERYONE NEEDS TO WATCH THIS SHOW!!!!"
690,"The show is fantastic in all aspects. It's amazing when it comes to character development, horror and the use of racism to show how much of a monster it really is. I literally have to prepare myself for each episode because I know I will just be shook by the end of the episode. I honestly think most of these negative reviews further prove the point of the show. Quite frankly, the main people writing the show off as ""social justice"" or posting negative reviews are incapable of complex thinking and are probably offended since they like to pretend racism doesn't exist. For everyone else who doesn't live in a bubble, please make sure to watch the show, it's really good."
691,"This is a literary genius, the fact that they are flashing back to actual historical incidents, and the abhorrently ACCURATE portrayal of those times.
This is a must see tv show.
It's intelligent, some historical references are blatant and the others you have to look for by paying super close attention."
692,"The acting is phenomenal. The storyline is amazing. Character development and social clues are well written. This is just an all around amazing show. For the critics, it takes place in the 1950's, that's what it was like in the 1950's for black people at the hands of white. I'm not sure why they're upset over facts."
693,This show brings so many deep rooted emotions out of me. I love it.
694,"Nuff said. This will go nowhere. These two really know how to waste potential. Too bad.
1st ep had good potential, but of course since it's Jordan Peeled it went anti-white. Hilarious since the loser is married to a white chick. Basically scary stories with an anti-white twist. Creative, too bad it's racist."
695,Episode 1 was a great start to this story. I love Misha Green's vision for it and the homage to black history. Jonathan and Jurnee are a dream team in the driver's seat (literally!) & I look forward to the rest of the season.
696,"A series like this has been a long time coming. Perfectly written and casted with an almost all-black cast, Lovecraft Country does the black AND visible minority community of America due justice. It gives them what they deserve and what they have deserved all throughout history although often not acknowledged and while doing so, slaps the embedded white supremacy ideology that is ever so present right in the face, and rightfully so.The series starts off strong and mysterious, falls flat multiple times throughout and picks itself right back up near the end. Unfortunately, the so called ""magic"" presenting itself from the get-go loses its mysteriousness within the first couple of episodes once characters start to refer to it so often and so nonchalantly. Christina Braithwhite becomes less and less of a villain the more the series goes on and the more the main characters encounter her without much harm and really makes you wonder what the protagonist is fighting against at times. The writer could have avoided this by making those encounters much fewer or making each encounter come at an irreversible cost.The series makes a considerable effort of developing some of the side characters separately by dedicating a full episode to them while underlining major historical themes and issues of black people in America (black vs white self-perception, black identity and history of blackface and minstrel shows) but falls flat by steering off too much away from the main topic and main characters and loses its audience. This happens in Ep.5 ""Strange Case"", Ep.7 ""I Am"" and Ep.8 ""Jig-a-Bobo"" where it focuses on developing characters of Ruby, Hippolyta and Diana respectively. The only time it is successful in pulling off these side plots is in Ep.6 ""Meet Me in Daegu"" where it introduces a wholly new character named Ji-ah within the sub-theme of Korean War and ancient legends of Korea (by introducing the creature Kumiho) while incorporating the main protagonist, Tic. This episode actually ends up being one of the best episodes of the series. The series then soars high to its then unfulfilled potential in the penultimate episode, ""Rewind 1921"" and creates one of the most beautiful yet tragic time travels in TV show history. The final montage of Leti literally walking through fire in slo-mo in the midst of 1921 Tulsa massacre and coming out on top as the operatic piece is playing is one of the best montages to see. It's not a sight to enjoy; but rather is a sight to not forget. It's a reminder that these events only happened 100 years ago and could happen again, if we forget this was our history. Misha Green beautifully recreates history in this episode but this time through the eyes and ears of the black community, showing what they saw, heard, felt, endured. She does the entire black community justice by bringing this issue forward in the times where Black Lives Matter voices are stronger than ever and yet are silenced with force, like nothing has changed. After that, the series takes a slight dip at the beginning of Ep.10 ""Full Circle"" by presenting too much uncovered information and rushing the plot to the closure losing some of the audience for a bit, but then slows down near the end in a scene which is the ultimate finale, ending with a black female character, Diana holding a monster in control while standing on top of the cliff with the monster grunting towards the moon. This comes just after Leti's legendary line to Christina while she is gasping for breath, saying ""We reclaimed magic"". Leti's line along with Tic's mom saying at the beginning of episode ""I realized my fear was keeping me away from claiming the power we had all along"" as well as Diana's final scene, is such a beautiful tribute to the entire black community of America. It's a reminder that they have had the power all along to end systematic racism and white supremacy and they can unleash that power once they put away their fears of retaliation or being silenced. It's such a timely message in these times of further segregation.The cast all around is stellar. Jurnee Smollett and Jonathan Majors are cast as the two leads that fall in love and present an undeniable chemistry that's carried on all throughout. This was the first performance I saw from both and I was speechless especially by the vulnerability that Jonathan shows in so many scenes and by the female power and strength that Jurnee presents driving every major (Ha, see what I did here) decision forward. Jurnee still has that essence of femininity and motherhood and Jonathan still has that masculine arrogance and physicality and that's what makes the two so easy and comforting to relate to, neither is too feminine nor too masculine. Their delicate and tender performances is only enhanced by the so powerful performance of Michael Kenneth Williams, presenting as a vulnerable man who questions his fatherhood, manhood and sexuality. The ""villain"", played by Abbey Lee also stands in relative caliber to the rest of the cast considering she has only a few acting credits. Also, Jamie Chung's performance in Ep.6 ""Meet Me in Daegu"" is tender, lovable, vulnerable and just wholly beautiful.Overall, although the series steers off its main objective and loses its grip on the audience at multiple points, it stays true to its original idea at last and presents us with many beautiful and powerful moments that will stay with us for quite some time. Lovecraft Country is a history lesson, is a human touch and is a love letter to black Americans and is surely not a series to miss."
697,"Too much blood and gore for my taste.The story is not that bad, but it's drowned under the gorey scenes, which try to overdo the previous one.Tried to hang on, but eventually gave up at episode 9, after some self reflection."
698,"Loved the cinematography, visuals, performance, intensity of the show and the script. I liked that it was fast moving considering that they had so much to get through in the plot. I enjoyed the sci-fi elements as well which made it more unique. Can't wait for the next season. Highly recommend if you're into fantasy!"
699,"The greatest sin a show can do, be a big snoozefest. Pacing is way off and episodes after episode 2 feel like they are filler episodes.Character development is good and all but it must progress the story in a meaningfull way as well.
not recommended."
700,"Maybe we're not paying enough attention but this show is too confusing, all over the place, not thoughtfully sequenced, and seems to be based on unnecessary horror/surprise and other issues.
still have no idea what the episode taking place during the korean war was all about or what significance it has.
where and why do these gigantic monsters appear - seems more of the same - just cinematic surprise but little substance.
yes, this is defin itely not based on LOVECRAFT writings, nowhere near, his work is brilliant writing, building suspense and use of the language to bring the reader into the world being describes. this tv show does nothing of the sort.
guess its fine for some as their simple entertainment, but most everyone i spoke with was disappointed in the slickness but lack of any TRUE intellect. but again, modern entertainment is Not aimed at intellect, just to permeate a thick (or half-filled) skull not requiring not much real reflection.
if you enjoy it, great, its fun, good acting, we watch it, but since they snatched and appended the Lovecraft name we expected way more. READ lovecraft if you want to experience his true brilliance in horror. if you don't (can't) read, ok, be entertained by these many basic tv productions."
701,"There are lots of disgruntled HP Lovecraft fans who are not happy with this show and are giving 1 & 2 star reviews. They're expecting horror with Cthulhu-like stuff and they don't realize that the book 'Lovecraft Country' was written by Matt Ruff and has nothing to do with HP Lovecraft directly and that the show is adapted from the book.It's my understanding that Matt Ruff isn't a fan of Lovecraft the man (who was a known racist) which is why he has black protagonists while touching on Lovecraftian(?) themes. The diehard Lovecraft fans come with full on HP Lovecraft expectations and get frustrated. I get that. What's not fair is that they're not giving it a chance. Lovecraft Country -the tv show and maybe the book too; I'll read that once the show is over- is FULL of so much history, good and bad.After you've watched the show, please do your due diligence and google the fan-created syllabi as well as listen to the official podcast for more info & clarification. Just FYI, I don't work for HBO; I just really love this show."
702,This show will have you on the edge of your seat every week. It's not predicate all and painfully accurate. I can understand why white critics have it such a harsh rating.....it's sucks to see how vile and nasty your ancestors were doesn't it? Imagine actually living through it...
703,"Rich characters, thrilling storyline... These writers COME THROUGH with twists and turns and SO MANY LAYERS. I listen to the HBO podcast afterward to get all the nuances. It is a perfect blend of history, culture, sci-fi and fantasy. The actors are stupendous and the special effects are just WOW. Joined a Facebook group for discussion because it's wonderfully complex. Bring on the Emmys!!!"
704,"It's only two episodes in, but can understand the negative reviews. It is all over the place. It's really hard to grasp what's going on. Maybe they're building it up slowly? All I know is that I'm this one until episode four to win me over."
705,"This beautifully written sic-fi series is centered around real events that effected our black history and I absolutely can't get enough of it. The focus on the strong, black characters is admirable. Everyone is strong-willed! Anyone who does not like how this show has portrayed white people has trouble accepting the reality of how black people have been mistreated for centuries. Those are the people who feel entitled to everything and since this series does not shine a white, angelic light on the Caucasian race, they're upset. But for once we can have a full sci-fi series about us. To understand every aspect of this series is to be willing to understand the layers and the dynamics of each character and a lot has to do with how they were treated back then! A great watch and would recommend to anybody!"
706,Absolutely amazing. This is the type of film I wish was available when I was growing up.
707,"We're only one episode in, but Misha Greene's adaptation already looks promising. There was just enough suspense and mystery to keep audiences guessing, right up until the very end. The series manages to pack mythology, an ode to comics, and horror in one hour. The segregated South and sundown towns serve as the perfect locales for the real fear Blacks experienced during Jim Crow.I suspect the show will continue to blur the lines between fictional monsters and the human ones that Black Americans wouldn't want to encounter after dark. I really appreciated the nod to James Baldwin and the guidebook used by Black folks when traveling through the South.Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Courtney B. Vance are phenomenal as Leti and Uncle George, respectively. I can't wait to see what Michael K. Williams brings to the table as Atticus' missing father, Montrose. HBO has another hit on its hands. And Jordan Peele, Misha Greene, and J.J. Abrams should be proud of what they've delivered so far.You'll come for the horror, but stay for the storyline and trek through Jim Crow America."
708,I can't wait for the Lovecraftian themes to unfold in contrast to racial issues
709,Show is really good but it's falling victim to the new age era of everything is either a Classic all time great piece of work or it's Trash. Also I saw a review that said that the show had heavy handed racism in it which is why they disliked it and that has to be one of the dumbest things I ever heard and the number 1 reason why everyone doesn't deserve to post on here. The racism depicted in this show is pg compared to the realities in which it had happened in real life.
710,This is a truly phenomenal show and leaves me wanting more. Must see and I really hope there's a season 2
711,"Really good series that brings together a great cast, great writers and director. We couldn't have a better result!"
712,"Could use more cohesion, but if AHS can get mad positive reviews the LCC deserves as much, if not more, praise."
713,So much false negativity towards this show. Wonder why? Because of the racial element I presume. So many of the reviews sound like they are coming from people that seem triggered or butt-hurt by the premise or story telling. As compared to most of Hollywood white washing of every subject its nice to see a show thats not cookie cutter pretty white ppl saving the world. Its ab enjoyable show if you watch with an open mind.
714,"I don't normally review things on here because of things like this but the racist reviews are out for this one. Those who rate this a 1 or honestly anything below a 5 clearly have not watched more than 1-2 episodes. This show is fantastic don't be fooled by the ratings. Lovecraft is an 8/10 at worst. The payoff is there and every episode you find confusing, keep going because that confusion is only used to create a unique story and suspense as all good shows do. The acting is phenomenal and the characters are extremely relatable yet complex. It also focuses on a time in which monsters where often times men and uses that to fuel the terror that keeps you on the edge of your seat during the entirety of the series. I love this show it has quickly become one of my favorites. Keep in mind I don't care for the original Lovecraft. Also, if you are one of the white people who think this show is a anti-white piece just shut-up and go give birth of a nation a 10/10 or something. Your opinion could not matter less!"
715,"As a horror & Lovecraft fan (yes ya'll, we know it's not HP Lovecraft but it's still a homage to his style you nerds), I really appreciate the way the show asks the question, ""whose the real monster here?""Following black characters in segregated 1950s America, through this bizarre, sci-fi realm of magic, transfiguration & time travel is....whew. It's a lot to unpack in the best of ways. Then there's the layers of real African American history woven all throughout the show with ""easter eggs."" Dissecting the show in online groups + listening to the podcast after each episode is a nerd's wet dream.There's been some reviews that say this show is ""too black"" or they're ""too white to get it"" & I don't buy that at all. You don't have to look like a character nor share their sexual orientation to have a human connection with them & empathize with their anger, pain, fear & suffering....& celebrate their successes & victories. I find myself cheering Leti on when she gets that, ""not today mother effer"" look in her eye/If you loved Watchmen, can stand some gore & enjoy history mixed with lots of mythology, this show is for you :)"
716,An incredible show with characters I love learning more about. The season finale didn't disappoint!!
717,I I have enjoyed every episode of the series! Each episode brings different emotions and have me wanting more..I can't see what happens next!
718,"If you have seen one episode and think you can predict where this show is going you are wrong. The same after two, three or even seven episodes. You are going to have to give the whole first season your time. It will be worth it. Light on the horror, BIG on the adventure, sharp on the drama, just as it should be.I have watched a lot of TV and this is one of the best shows ever. Do not get turned away by the jump scares in episode 1 and 3. It gets better, meaning less horror elements and more of everything else there is in the smörgåsbord that makes good television..."
719,This show is absolutely amazing. It was well thought out and planned to every second. I love the attention to detail.
720,"Honestly at first I had my doubts but after watching the first episode I was hooked into the storyline and what it got in store for the upcoming episodes.
The show does a great way on portraying what it's really still happening in the real world. This show doesn't waste time with the corny romance adventure comedy plots. It tells a story about how a community gets treated in a horror sci-fi suspense plot. A genre that how the African Americans community has been shut from. It's a stranger things meets get out meets us meets hunger games(kinda if my theory comes into play of course). Just give it a try and you witness yourself The masterpiece. Then decide if is for you or if is not. Just don't pay attention to the racist people giving the show a one star. The show is unique and is a type of show we need out there. It got potential they can do many things with it. Can't wait for what's next."
721,This show is phenomenal! The minor details along with the storyline is just what TV needed!
722,"It's not lovecraft, what does it matter, the main actors are absurdly good, stuff to cry ... good very good excellent never seen acting so well in a series.
do yourself a favor, watch this series without too many thoughts and an eye on acting and you will enjoy as you never did"
723,"Jordan Peele and JJ Abrams have done it and I mean done it. The amalgamation of black history, American history and science fiction is something that I have never experienced before. I said experiences because it is just that...an experience. The episodes stay with you and you try to unpack all that the writers and producers have given you. I am hooked. I will study and pray that I can one day write like these geniuses"
724,"I was wary because of what happened to the last two HBO shows I watched. But I was drawn to Jordan Peele's hand in it. I didn't read the book. But this was a lot to take in, but very good to watch. I hope it gets a season 2."
725,"Awesome movie have to watch the full season to appreciate. I'm in love Oluwunmi.
Can't wait for season 2."
726,Great show !!!! Tic better still be alive next season
727,"I can't believe reviewers that decide to write about this magnificent show and then betray their ignorance about it. One reviewer in the NYT complained that the Emmett Till sequence had nothing to do with the plot, when of course, little Dee was his best friend, and his murder sent her into a major trauma. This was brilliantly conceived and written and the acting was perfect.One of the greatest TV shows of all times."
728,"I loved it obviously it is not meant for everyone. Definitely must read the novel I am a need like that , the effects the actors everything was incredible, with a hit of science fiction in it went well together...keeps me wanting more , hopefully season 2 in the works ..."
729,"As a horror/sci-fi fan I was very curious to watch Lovecraft Country. I cannot judge the adaptation from the novel, because I have never read it, so my review is based solely on the series itself. The production feel pretty solid: the script is solid and well written, characters are interesting and very well developed, the cast is top notch, composed by important names such as Jurnee Smollett, Abbey Lee and Michael Williams. The show is setted during the 50's in America, the series along the story line, tries also to represent how hard could be for black people to live during those times.The show is very explicit and there are many graphic scenes. Overall special effects quality is high, however there are a few sequences that are ridiculous. Maybe they should have tried to have more practical effects on set, some scenes could be improved a lot. I really liked the mix between horror and sci-fi. The script is solid and coherent, characters are really interesting and it is easy to bound with them, because they always evolve and we get to know them really well, as they show different kind of emotions, they always show their best and worst part, they feel realistic, they feel human.The narrative structure is really interesting; the show usually have different plots happening on the same timeline. I was able to see and deepen the storyline of every single character, leaving no one behind, so we are constantly updated about everything. You don't feel that the show is rushed, it takes time, but because there are so many things happening, you never feel bored."
730,This show is simply amazing. Growing up in the late 70's early 80's I did not see a reflection of myself on tv. If I did espically in horror or sci-fi we (black people) were killed off early. I grew up loving The Twilight zone and Afred Hitchcock and everything in-between. This appeals to the black girl nerd in me that wished I could have seen something like this on the screen growing up. Every single character is developed. No weak story lines and everything is pushed into the weirdness of sci-fi showing intelligent women and men. So many layers like real people and to see Black people taking the lead instead of being the funny sidekick. I am here for it.
731,I applaud Misha Green and company for bringing this show and painting a picture we all need to see. HBO should keep this series on TV for several seasons.....
732,"I wasn't sure what this show would be and thought it would be similar to a gory vampire type tv show (I watch those types of things but thought I'd just get around to it). I watched it because 2 people recommended it to me and I can't rate this show highly enough. It is so nuanced and each episode takes you on a journey to understanding each character a bit more.The cast, chemistry, acting, script, costume, set, story, etc. Evyerthing that is in this show makes you feel like you're getting a glimpse of people's lives. If you want to watch extremely good quality television then watch this. I can't even share how much I loved everything about it and the nuance of the stories."
733,Incredibly disappointing. Lots of lore to draw from and it barely scratches the surface. It just became boring and predictable.
734,"This is one of best shows on TV. Not only does it keep you glued to your seat, it keeps your jaw dropping week after week with all of its twists and turns"
735,"Finally, great storytelling, superb acting, and extremely important/relevant themes to unpack weekly. The podcast is a must as well!"
736,"Foremost - HBO has historically been overtly sexual, political & ahead of its time - no surprise, that's what we love about it. This show took a couple of episodes to fully grasp my attention but I'm glad I continued watching. Racial injustice has always been an issue - For those who critique this show based on the prominent & accurate display of prejudice do not provide accurate reviews. As a brown woman I appreciate seeing people of color as lead roles & in a super natural series nonetheless. Love craft Country is original, captivated & important. The acting, writing & storyline are generally good! Give it a watch. 8/10"
737,"Race is the most controversial aspect of H.P. Lovecraft's legacy, expressed in many disparaging remarks against people of color: Lovecraft describes black people not as human but as ""beast(s) ... in semi-human figure, filled with vice. ""Lovecraft Country"" (book and TV) turns this evilness on its bloated head and the HBO show gives viewers an entirely new view through the eyes of black women. Like ""Watchmen,"" the women leads are strong and charismatic. The male leads are complex. Each episode is different and, yet, linked through the main protagonist.I'm loving this show."

739,I love this show. It's so layered. I love that it directly confronts white america on it's sin. And I'm a white man.The historical references. The juxtaposition of contemporary music. It's a wonderful and horrible tapestry.
740,I'm obsessed with this show ep.8 is pure talent! Jurnee and Jonathan work well together! 😍
741,"This show is truly amazing! I love the writers,poets,actors just everyone. These writers think outside of the box. Its part crazy and part history. I just can't get enough. I applaud you all for this creative and beautiful show!"
742,"It's so clear from some of the other reviews that white people live in a completely different reality. All the Black folks I've spoken to about this show love it (unless they're just not into weird/scary stuff). We immediately see all the layers, connect all the cultural references and icons, and know exactly what all the characters are feeling at different stages. This was a show made by us, for us and it's simply amazing!"
743,"I loved that this show used new actors as well as some familiar faces from Black tv/movies. They wove some historical figures and facts into a very creative and flexible story. It was bold and paradigm altering. It showcases many challenges of the Black experience and from multiple angles. This series will make you want to laugh, cry, fight. The characters will disgust you, surprise you and make you cheer. I only hope that the story line doesn't get watered down with another season in question. This is some really phenomenal story telling. Definitely give it a chance. We need to see more original Black stories like Lovecraft Country or movies and shows that are truly out of the ordinary. They put some unique concepts together and it made sense. Looking forward to seeing what Misha Green does next"
744,"I see all the bad reviews. Well I enjoyed the show from top to bottom. This show touches on the concept of BLACK PEOPLE HAVE THINGS WE HAVE BEEN SCARED AWAY FROM WHICH IS ORIGINALLY OURS.
I love that Peele touches on so many concepts dealing with the black perspective in a white society. This is an amazing show and if you're black you need to watch. If you're white and don't know YOUR FULL history then you might be upset and throw a hissy fit in the reviews."
745,"I grew up on Frankenstein, Werewolves, Witches, and even the people who turned into panthers. This show takes me back to that time and it gives horror a new perspective.The writing, acting, and directing... PHENOMENAL!!!!And the way they include history!!!! Spectacular!!!"
746,"I want to rave about how awesome this show is but I would be remiss if I didn't first comment on the grown cry baby's leaving these clearly intentionally negative reviews. Oh boo hoo, someone showed history from someone else's perspective and it happens to be truth. Poor sad wanna be victims lol. Is it any surprise that most of them don't even know that this show is not based on Lovecraft novels but on Matt Ruff's novel? LolAnyhow, this show is AMAZING! I know I said that already but the writing, the acting, and the story line are all impressive and keep me wishing I could binge watch the whole season instead of waiting every Sunday for a new episode.The combination of modern music with emotional scenes is brilliantly done. It goes without saying that it's also extremely awesome to see faces that look like mine on screen on my favorite genre but I think I would love this show no matter what the race of the actors were. Looking forward to seeing the rest of the season and already hoping for a 2nd season."
747,"Horror and Sci-fi are not genres that I enjoy. In fact, I avoid horror films and shows every chance I get but I am thoroughly enjoying this show. HBO has hit one out of the park with Lovecraft Country. Not only is it visually stunning but the writing is outstanding and very thought-provoking. I love the historical references and the little nuisances that you may miss if you blink. I have to watch episodes multiple times. And seeing such a variety of intriguing characters who are not afraid to be different but embrace their uniqueness is awe-inspiring. I must say that Ruby is my favorite character. She is strong and fierce, determined and outspoken. All of the characters are well-developed. This is a show that is indeed needed in a time like this. Thank you HBO for continuing to bring us ground-breaking masterpieces like this!!"
748,"Let me tell you, no other show can keep my attention and keep me on edge as much as Lovecraft has kept me on edge. The historical context. The horror. The Science Fiction Twists. So many themes in one show. An amazing experience. I hope we get plenty of seasons."
749,"This wonderful adventure show is social conscious and awesomely witty, with a firecracker cast that all audience may not be able to stomach. If you love adventure and you understand race and America without feeling guilty you'll love this show."
750,"This show is beyond a wonderful depiction of history, sci-fi/fantasy, education, and brilliance! I have learned so much watching this show! I've also been extremely emotionally invested in the characters it's dynamic! Glad to see something like this finally on the screen!"
751,"WARNING:
1. This is not a Lovecraft story so fans of the author should not expect the same themes and atmospheres.
2. If you are a right wing snowflake who get triggered by anything depicting inequality or centering the story around people of color is SJD leftist propaganda you will not be able to watch Lovecraft County. If you think depicting history accurately (excluding the supernatural parts), even if it's not that much preachy is virtue signaling you will not be able to see the forest for the trees.
UPDATE: I have now finished the entire first season and will give an update to my review with my final verdict. I am reading the book so I might give another update. The old review can be read below.The season as a whole got better but was still a bit of a disappointment. The good parts are great but it isn't enough to make it great. Lovecraft country seem to forget a bit what makes is special. It successively changes fokus and gets more and more like a pretty generic supernatural TV series. A series that could balance this great is ""Buffy the vampire slayer"" and Lovecraft country could have been as great but unfortunately stumbled a bit.
If you can look past it's flaws you will like it at least enough to finish season 1.Old review
I'm going to be honest. I didn't know how much the book strayed from Lovecraft but I'm trying to put those feelings aside.
The first episode was great. A real nail biter with good acting, tension and atmosphere.
But the quality plummeted after that. The tone is all over the place and the shows strengths gets to play second fiddle.
The themes of racism and how the characters cope with it in combination with a mystery is enough. We don't need ghost stories or Indiana Jones. Let the characters take center stage.There is a bit of a ""monster of the week"" vibe right now but I hope this will not be the case."
752,"I mean if the endlessly sexy title ""Lovecraft Country"" isn't enough, surely Tic and Leti - the two most badass, charismatic, adorable, and wholesome characters (it's been two episodes and I've already fallen in love, sue me) - played by one beefy Jon Majors and the ever divine Jurnee Smollett will convince you to take a chance on a show that is actually putting the sexy back in sci-fi. A lot has already happened in the first two episodes, and if they're anything to go by this show is gonna be one hell of a mo'fo ride. Peace."
753,"Slow throughout most of the first episode but then the action (and horror) kicks in towards the end, leaving you wanting more.For those too young to understand, there is a lot of racism elements throughout the episode and though it may feel out of place within your mind, in reality, it is exactly what life was like back then for people of color.If you can't handle seeing racist people behaving the way racist people did back then - then this isn't going to be for you. It's not an attack on white people. It's a realistic window into how people of color were attacked daily for no other reason than being people of color. Don't get it twisted. This is a horror/sci-fi story, a fact that is made clear by the end of the first episode."
754,"I suspect that while ""Lovecraft Country"" was getting filmed, they didn't suspect that it would become even more significant due to the protests that swept the country in the wake of George Floyd's murder. But even putting that aside, it's one of the most intense shows out there (and this is coming from someone who's seen ""Game of Thrones"" and ""American Horror Story""). Like the recent ""Watchmen"", it depicts the Tulsa Massacre, wherein a white mob razed the black neighborhood in the Oklahoma town in 1921. There are a number of other instances of racism portrayed, all in a fantasy-horror context. Not like anything that you've ever seen, but you should see it. Be aware that you're in for a shock, though."
755,"I almost gave up on Lovecraft Country after the first episode. The first half hour was tedious, there was a little excitement and then it got tedious again, and finally at the end there was about 20 minutes of solid horror action that made me decide to give it another chance. Subsequent episodes were quite good, and by the end of the season episodes were downright amazing.The premise of this series is interesting. The protagonists are black, living in the 1950s American south, and dealing with twin threats: destructive supernatural forces and white folk. And one is as deadly as the other.The series follows Atticus (played by Jonathon Majors, who must work out 5 hours a day), who discovers his supernatural heritage as a romance develops with the kick-ass Leti (Jurnee Smollett) and deals with ongoing trauma relating to his abusive father (Michael K. Williams). They search for hidden magic as they deal with haunted houses, racist yahoos, super-racist cops with magic of their own, and a spooky, mysterious white sorceress (Abbey Lee) who seems to exist in a moral gray area.A lot of crazy things happen in this series, which involves monsters, time travel, murder, immortality, and lots and lots of white people being monstrous.Don't let the first episode put you off. Outside of that the series ranges from good to truly remarkable. Highly recommended."
756,"The writing is fantastic giving much credit to Ms. Misha Green I stay on edge with very moment of the show. Visually the show captures you and holds your attention. Much love to episode 7 (made me cry) The show is a crazy ride, it's a show filled with drama action awareness and truth, I can't wait to see what's coming next"
757,Absolutely love this show. Very creative. A couple episodes lost me for a little bit because of it being slow but very good!
758,"Amazing show! Packed with thrill, romance, comedy. Tons of thought provoking scenarios ! If you give a rating anything other than positive you are fearful of truth and creating a victim mentality! Come to terms with who the true oppressors are and let this show continue to shed light on history while upholding expectations of what entertainment in film really is!"
759,"I got intrigued by the trailer, it looked like something I would truly enjoy, but it left me feeling a bit disappointed. The premise of the show is excellent, taking place during a truly dark time in US history. And the setting, music and production value is really up there among the best I seen in a few years.I have no issue with the acting either, they did the best with that little they had, they tried giving the characters a little depth before things started to go crazy. For me to get invested in the main characters I however need more time to start emphatising with them, so when things started to really heat up I found myself not really caring if one of the characters died, I actually hoped that one of the three would die horribly just so I could feel that things werent so obvious and they had plot armor thicker 2 inch steel.I was hopeing that the show would be a little more sutle and slowly bulid up the tension and horror but after the first episode I rather felt like this might turn into the monster of the week show. And for that there are much better series out there. But still I liked it enough to give it a chance it might pick up speed.And for the love of xxx whats up with the amount 1* or 10* review ratings? Thats just crazy, be reasonable pls."
760,"As a sci-fi fan, all you have to do to get me hooked is use words like ""Lovecraft"", ""vampires"", ""monsters"", etc. but adding Jordan Peele and JJ Abrams then you don't need to say anything else. So when I watched the pilot, I was BLOWN AWAY by literally everything I saw. But what's more incredible than the sci-fi elements of the story are 100% the three main characters and their travels from Chicago through the racist, segregated north east part of the country in the 1950's. From minute one, I was completely engaged with Jonathan Majors as Atticus Freeman and his search for his father. His passion for literature, regardless of who wrote it and his love of science fiction/fantasy/horror and how he rationalized enjoying the works of racist authors whose work he admires. Seeing the country at that period in time through the lens of black peoples being essentially hunted by racist goons is terrifying in its own obvious way and resonates today in a country who still treats black people so poorly. But these terrifying moments are definitely not over shadowed by the other monsters who attack Atticus, his uncle and his friend Leticia. I don't want to say too much because it really needs to be seen and obviously I've only seen the pilot but between this first episode and the trailer for what's next, I am hooked."
761,"Great show, love the chemistry amongst the actors and the pace and storyline through episodes is amazing."
762,"Right up my alley, love the historical touches and also love the fantasy/Sci-Fi, a great watch, good acting. Look forward to the second season and hope it does not start to go sideways :P"
763,"The overall buildup of the series is magnificent. The racial tension that is portrayed really speaks to the viewers, I can see Lovecraftian elements (both good and bad--yeah I get the racism part of H.P. Lovecraft being anti-semite. I can remember the car chase scene in the woods with the cop car chasing them out of his county very vividly--well done! But after that it goes downhill for me. Suddenly I have the feeling I'm ended up in National Treasure of some sort of MacGyver episode, don't get me wrong. I enjoyed both of them, but the series seems to get a let down. It jumps and skips from imitating Mississippi Burning (in a good and honest way actually). from Urotsukidoji (the manga) to Sabrina the teenage witch and Buffy the vampire slayer. The feeling that the directors wanted to tell too much in this series overwhelms me. I really wanted to enjoy LC since Lovecraft and racial tension are powerful themes, but I just can't wrap my mind around the meaning or what purpose of the series is. Is it the racial tension, or the magic, or the adventure, or the otherworldly horror creatures? Can anybody tell me? Thanks in advance."
764,I love absolutely love this show. Every single episode keeps me entertained and in awe. I love shows that cross genres and this is one of the best. This show has easily become one of my favorites.
765,So intriguing and needed in today's society!! I love everything about this show.
766,I absolutely love this show. I've watched every episode multiple times. The acting is on point and the historical references throughout the show make my inner history nerd smile. I almost feel like I need a syllabus for each episode to stay on top of things!
767,"From the writing to the acting to the producing directing, this show is amazing! A great mixture of real history with fantasy. Every episode takes you on a different journey. Black voices And people are not one size fits all. Thank you for seeing us."
768,"Captivating, suspenseful, thrilling and an invigorating piece of work. Lovecraft Country (LCC) is all the action, horror, suspense, drama and science fiction that has been missing all my life. The most mystical folks on the planet have been left out of sci-fi and fantasy but with LCC they are given the breadth and script to create magic on screen.
The cast is amazing! They really put in work on this project and the evidence is laid bare on each episode. The historical references and Easter eggs in this layered storytelling will have you watching and rewatching. Brilliant!"
769,"Jordon Peele!! Wow sir all of you have done an amazing job. Every episode there's a 🔑 key. With everything going on we needed this show, it has made my 2020."
770,This show is so many things! The actors/actresses talents supercede my expectations. I love how well each episode is put together. I honestly can't put into words how good it is. Please let there be a season 2. You have gained a fan!
771,"This show is everything wrapped in one. Horror,family issues,love, history it lives you wanting more, asking more and learning more .... love it 😍"
772,10/10. I binge watch it over every week. Its that good
773,I love this show. It brings out all of my emotions and then there's always a twist. Very well written. Thank you for the history lesson.
774,"Every episode is so well written, so well acted, and so well directed!! I love this show, especially Jurnee Smollett! I'm sad the season is almost over."
775,This series was the most genre bending ride I've had in a long time! I wouldn't miss an episode and had watched parties just so we could discuss the mind blowing plot lines and uncover historical elements. So many great talking points and powerful moments. Perfect actors and writers. This should win awards for creativity and acting!
776,"I don't understand why TV shows with predominantly black actors and actresses rate so low! Sure it can be a bit confusing at times but it all comes together in the end. Absolutely one of, if not the top newest shows on TV right now: most certainly leading the way for HBO Don't believe the negative reviews -just stick with it and appreciate the beautiful art of sci-fi writing and prowess of Jordan Peele and JJ Abrams. It may be a bit much for the weak of heart which is why critics are pressing the controversy button. Sure of some of the scenes hard to watch but that's the reality of how black people were treated throughout the night 18th century and still today in some cases. Sit back and enjoy the show and let it all come together and I promise you you will not be disappointed nothing less than superb television!"
777,I've watched many excellent shows on HBO the the last few decades but this one by far is the cream of the crop. This show checks so many boxes and does it with such style and grace. Thank you so much to the writers and actors and to HBO to putting out this series. You have made the world a better place by sharing this art with us.
778,"I love how the writers incorporated actual Black History into this series. It's not sugar coated, but raw in your face. The acting is superb. The women are my Sheroes!!"
779,"This was not for most of y'all because most of y'all suffer from abhorrent dissonance. But for those of us capable of grappling with reality, this show was brilliant. Thrilling. Deeply emotional and poignant. Talented. And visionary. A tall order well accomplished."
780,.....then watch the series. It's not what you think. Enjoy the horror. Creepy good.
781,"I love everything about this series so far. Episode one is all I need. I expected an Octavia Butler-esque story and visuals, but this has its own vibe. The set is perfect. Costumes are fantastic. And the soundtrack and voiceovers are enlightening. It makes me happy to watch, but it also breaks my heart because of the time in which this story was set.While the black population still encounters racism the overtly racist encounters in this are anger inducing, yet, motivating. I am finding new references to follow; new material to submerge myself into. I feel educated having watched this, and excitement watching the adventures unfold.Because of when its set, Jim Crow era, you are always waiting for the shoe to drop, on something explosive to happen. When it does you are not disappointed.
I am completely impressed with the characters' ability to investigate and research and how well read they were. I knew black folks were literate and intelligent and brave, though that's not the image frequently portrayed. . But this was refreshing to see - if just for that.
8/27/2020"
782,But I don't care when it comes to this show. The acting is wonderful. And Jurnee Smollett is so effing wonderful. I'll watch anything with her In it. Actually all of the artists in this show deserve an award. If not for JJ this would be an incredible show to watch.
783,"Having no idea what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised watching LoveCraft Country. A few thoughts:How did they get all of these talented and beautiful actors to work on this show?I learn so much history each episode.Misha Green is becoming one of my faves.Jonathan Majors is fiiiiiine.Journee and Aujanue better win Emmy's.Each episode is something new and it's a ride I'm glad I strapped in for."
784,"This show is one of my favorite kind of shows. If you blink you miss something major. The devil is truly in the details of the show which is phenomenal by the way. the story, the writing, the acting! oh my god they're acting! The music too! HBO really hit it on the nail this one. I have been cooked since episode one and I am a little sad that this is a limited series Because this is one of the best shows HBO has put out in a really long time."
785,This show always leaves me wanting more and it's pack with action. I love the mystery factor and sci-fi feel to it!
786,I really love this show and really enjoy watching it it a masterpiece In story telling as well as tackling hard to swallow issues. The writing are amazing and the actors bring there beautiful words to life keep up the amazing work
787,This show brings my love for sci-fi and history all into one! The development of each character's storyline is perfect and ties them all together. I am excited about what's to come of the show!
788,"Great show that I look forward to and anticipate every week with excitement. I love that the show leaves me thinking and every thing in the show has intent. History, thriller, love, sacrifice, and sci fi all in one. Who could ask for anything else. Truly pleased."
789,"With deeply layered stories, amazing acting, and stunning special effects, Lovecraft Country weaves real life horrors with magic and science fiction in a powerful tale of a family facing the 1950s as Black Americans."
790,This show is straight fye 🔥🔥🔥 and letti can get it ;)
791,This show is phenomenal! I am so happy that HBO has chosen to air a series that shows the plight African Americans have faced since Jim Crow. The actors do an amazing job at portraying their characters and I am always on the edge of my seat anticipating the storyline as it unfolds. Those dancing pickaninny twins did their THANG in S1E8... the choreography was stellar and they could hold their own against Jason and Freddy Krueger! I can't wait to watch S181 again!!! I sure hope a S2 is in the works...
792,Outstanding show! From the history references to the creative writing that leaves the audience captivated; this show is a must watch!!
793,"This is an amazing show. The writers, actors, set , special effects all are phenomenal! I've never been into these kind of supernatural shows but the way they weave the magic into the storyline is so creative! I truly enjoy this and hope there is a second season. It's nice to see such a talented cast that also happen to be black. The story of black history need to be told"
794,"Admittedly from the very first episode I found myself drawn to the story. Having heard much about the book I worried if I needed to read it first. Just the opposite- the series has inspired me to want to read the book, listen to the weekly podcast and join discussion groups to process all that we've seen. Kudos to the writers, directors and cast. This is a must see!"
795,This Show is absolutely Amazing it tells Black history correctly. Doesn't sugar coat the racism to force white comfort. Plus magic what more could you ask for!!??
796,This show grabbed me from the first episode. I didn't expect that there would be pieces of African American history and folklore woven so seamlessly into the story. The acting is amazing from all of the characters. I love how each character gets their story told. I wasn't ready for the horror aspect; however unfortunately many of the ills endured on the show are still being perpetrated today. It's amazing how much information you get in one episode. Don't blink or you will miss important clues or details. My heart is still racing from episode 7. Great television!
797,"A black Sci-fi show, that's well written and thoughtful what's not to love? The cast is awesome, great performances from everyone. You just have to watch the show and fall in love with the story and characters. Misha Green did it with this one!!!"
798,I really loved this show. Every bit of this show was top class. Great cast storyline and effects. Bring on season 2
799,"Bottom line: if you are interested in black history and can root for David over Goliath (even if you aren't David), this show is awesome! Nuanced, educational, entertaining.. all of the above. If you have no interest in black history, this show is not for you. No judgment. However, when you leave a bad review it's like me giving a review of heavy metal and I'm simply not a fan from the jump.On all levels, this is the best tv on screen right now. Join an online discussion group and enjoy!!!"
800,"I'll be the first to admit how hesitant I was to watch a show set in the Jim Crow era with monsters. However, I'm glad I did, to me LCC is an unorthodox love letter to black people. The acting, literary references, the music and wardrobe are amazing! This show is everything we needed at this time! Each episode there is so much to unpack, the truths that are being told in an unconventional way. I feel so empowered after every episode. Tic, Uncle George, Leti, Ruby, Hippolyta, Montrose, Christina, William, and Dee leave nothing on the table. There is never a scene that I feel wasn't unwarranted and no explosion is too big. It's the historical context and acting for me!"
801,"I read few reviews good and bad
If u ask me it's was ok until monsters start appearing
Eh Never expected that tbh
Turned it off"
802,Great show to watc. It's really good. I like it. It's not for everybody.
803,"I'm a huge fan of period pieces with good actors, strong writing and quality production value. Much like Regina King's, ""The Watchmen,"" ""Lovecarft Country's"" protagonists are dealing with racist powers that be! I'm intrigued to see how it plays out after watching the premier episode. I'm not a huge horror fan, but it has a sci-fi element that blends well. I suppose that's why J.J. Abrams and Jordan Peele are at the helm of the show. Looking forward to what may come of this show."
804,"I don't know what's the baseline but this is a phenomenal show series so far.Can only account for all bad reviews, low ratings and rantings as then some, having way too much bleach in their system to mask real entertainment from being great again. Amen."
805,"Mysterious, unthinkably twisted and imaginatively riveting. A must watch!"
806,"I just finished binge watching over the course of 4 days and was invested in every episode! It definitely has its hard to watch moments of racial violence but overall, as a fan of supernatural horror this is a classic for me that I've purchased through Apple TV. I will be watching it again before Season 2 comes out."
807,"I'm a big fan of Lovecraft Country and I really hope there's a second season. Sure, the storyline is a bit chaotic but having watched the entire season, I feel quite gifted for my ability to follow and grow to love this fantastic story. The entire cast is superb and practically flawless. I finished the series weeks ago and I'm still thinking about it. To me, that's a good thing, things that make you think."
808,"This is my FOURTH binge watch in less than a week. I thoroughly enjoy the sci-fi, comic/ superhero, period vibe going on. Each actor/actress embodies their characters with poise, accuracy and raw believability. The way each episode is able to pull in actual historic events and blend effortlessly with the plot is EPIC, in my opinion. I experienced raw emotion which is a big deal for me watching a series.
Bravo!"
809,I love this show!!! It grabs my attention and never loosens up
810,This is an awesome show that really shows the complexities of being Black in America. The show is timeless as Black folks today can relate to what the black folks during that time in era were going through.
811,Can't stop watching it! The writers are brilliant.
812,I can't wait for this show to come on. Sunday's are my day. I anticipate all week the next episode. I am in love with the characters and their stories. The writing for this show is incredible. The actors that bring the story to life are incredible. The tid bits of history and how it is incorporated in the show...love it.
813,The level of excitement every week for this show is unmatched! One of the best things to happen for me in 2020!
814,"This is so far, outstanding. The acting lives up to par and is exceptional at times. But my point is that much of this fiction is not only based on truth, but to tell history from a Black American's eyes must indeed be chilling. Torture, murder, lynchings, terrorism, segregation, insults, profiling--my god, how long will this list go? And before all this, they were slave chattel.
What does this show lack? Is it a thriller, with plenty of chills and spills. Suspense? Of course. Gut and gore? Scary moments? Sí. Frights-a-plenty. Sexy? Yes, sir. Pretty girls galore. And some hunky men too.
Add to this mix a good healthy dose deep seeded hatred and racism and you have a provocative potion that can scare up any devil.
My last thought is that what this country did to create such monsters that have brought hell on earth to black people is unpardonable. It is now wonder that they look upon white people with such fear and mistrust.
But bravo to the heady people that have the courage to tell this story in such an engaging way.
Hell, I would not change a thing."
815,"It turned out to be a mediocre show because the story went all over the place, not because there was ""graphic rape."" If you're a stuck up american idiot who also has stupid religious beliefs why are you even watching hbo, of course you'll get offended. That's why they put gay sex on all the shows, to make you bigots throw up because you're sick in the head, not the people having the gay sex. Then calling it a lifestyle makes you also look like a dolt... Take your bigotry elsewhere. We know you don't like black people anyways so why even bother writing the dumb **** you write?"
816,"It kept me on the edge of my seat damn near the whole time. It's sad that people are downing on it for showing the truth behind 1950s America, if you don't like them showing the extent of Jim Crow then maybe just except that you're racist."
817,"I found the portrayal of racism and segregation to be very well used and depicted in just the premier alone. I can understand why people give the show a low rating just for that and I think its absolutely ridiculous that a show portrays real issues like that and people can't deal with being uncomfortable with how blacks were treated in the 20th century, let alone now. Its not a well covered topic in most media, but this show has hit the mark with representation of the issue, especially since its only a single facet of the show. This will definitely be an amazing series to come in the coming months and hopefully beyond. This is such a well produced show with amazing actors, soundtrack, sets, story, and set design. Can't wait to see what more Lovecraft Country has to bring to our heroes!"
818,"It's amazing how the show has a 5.3 rating with nothing but ""10"" and one ""9"" rating...typical. Great show featuring a wonderfully diverse cast of PoC. Love it. Can't wait for the next episode."
819,What an amazing production with accurate historical references and attention to detail. Lovecraft monsters ripping up racist cops in the 50's is just what the world needs right now.
820,Can't even categorize this show. It's everything in one. Amazing!
821,"Combining genres (horror and racial injustice) made the show that much better, by making me feel strong, but different, emotions at the same times. I loved how the writers added historic events for our characters to live thru as they solve this family legacy and taking us along for the ride. The soundtrack and poems overlaying the show's intense scenes were perfect. Lastly, the acting was superb by all the actors and great character development."
822,"I love the show. It is a mesh of history, horror, sci-fi, mystery and fantasy, all thrown together with some mind blowing graphics and shot into your brain and leaving you totally upset when you hear the closing song ""sinner man"" and realize you gotta wait a whole week for more."
823,"It has been a long time since I waited for 8 pm on Sunday to watch a TV show (GoT being the last show I was genuinely excited for), but this show. WOW. I have my alarm set to make sure I do not miss an episode. Deep and exciting plot. Amazing character development. Lots of connections to Black History, the Black experience in America, sci-fi/fantasy, and a splash of horror."
824,"The acting was amazing and characters and emotions believable.If you've read Lovecraft Country you know what to expect. This takes a great cast of actors and does not pull any punches. Earlier this year HBO rocked many people's worlds by showing them the Tulsa Massacre for the first time. IN the same way this first episode, ""Sundown"", introduces many Americans to the idea of Sundown Towns, which they some of us have not heard of before.In addition, just like Watchmen, Lovecraft Country is still true to its roots, bringing you horror and dread and true to the source, only without the racism and sexism that was found in Lovecraft's works."
825,"You know you're about to go on a crazy journey when the ""normal"" reality part of a Series story is your main characters are African Americans living in the horribly racist 1950's America! The depiction of the just disgusting things that went on towards African Americans, at that time, was enough to make me sick and was absolutely disturbing in itself. Yeah, and that was the ""normal"".Once they started throwing in the Supernatural elements, I was already hooked, but then it was a must binge series for me. The plot and storylines went int all different directions, coming at me fast and furious.Some elements reminded me of American Horror Story while others felt like something from Stephen King. Throw in Lovecraft and you have a hodgepodge of Sci-if/Horror soup!The acting is superb all the way through. Everyone fits their roles well. With the writers moving the pace along quick enough to never let the story get stagnant.I hope HBO does another season of this one! It's a crazy ride!"
826,"This is a must show for this century! I'm a world were we still fight against racism this show do what shows must be, show the reality of things about past present and future. I'm a fiction world dominated by monsters we see that the biggest monsters are actually hateful people themselves. The show get all this painful history and show us in a incredible and vivid way were we see the pain from each character. This is a show that must be seen by every person!"
827,"I was totally hooked on this show for the magical randomness and gory silliness mixed with actual historical horrors. Don't bother pondering logistics, just let it take you along for the ride. My only complaint was that this really had nothing much to do with Lovecraft's monsters, and that there really weren't many monsters at all other than human ones, but that also seems to be the point."
828,"As a horror fan it feels affirming that the leads are black and don't die foolishly. This showvis salve for my horror loving soul. And chalk full of more obscure black history facts. They hit the big ones for sure but it's the easter eggs for me.
I have stages of watching this show:
-Initial watch while live tweeting
-official podcast
-2nd watch
-facebook fan pages debates
-youtube breakdowns
-Wikipedia rabbit holes
-3rd watch
-anxiously await next sunday for new episode
It's a part time job and I love every minutePlease say it isn't over after this first season"
829,It's like a black Raiders of the Lost Ark meets Mississippi Burning with a dash of Alien and all the horror movies put into one. Love it!
830,"""HBO's"" ""Lovecraft Country"" is one entertaining series that blends drama, and science fiction horror at it's best! Plus the series is outspoken and brash with the characters always facing drama and on the run during the 1950's Jim Crow America. Atticus Freeman(Jonathan Majors) returns home from war to find his life upside down as his father is missing so he takes a journey to find him along with best friend Leti Lewis(Jurnee Smollet). Along the way the chase and journey is full of adventure, fun, and doubt. I for one never read any H.P. Lovecraft novels still this series is blended with his themes as many episodes have scenes of gore and wicked type monsters haunting the travels of Leti and Atticus. Entertaining and a watch for some fun, even though many mainstream viewers may not be into it."
831,"Rarely, do I entertain shows that keep my heart racing, whether it's good or bad. Based on the genre, I'd say it fits the bill over and over again. The suspense and gore are remarkably entertaining. Don't listen to the other reviewers. Their bias is showing."
832,So I must preface with the fact that I'm African American. This show is so endearing to my heart for some many reason.1.) STRONG BLACK LEADS- omfg FINALLY! Reading some of the reviews here will leave a bitter taste in your mouth who obviously don't understand that this is not a natural occurrence.2.) The plot is deconstructed stunningly! It does deal with a lot of political issues all at once and if you're not open minded and able to be patient to fall the show through it's easy to understand how you can get lost or lose interest.I don't want to make this review to long because I truly do want everyone to think for themselves but I love this show!!! I gave this show a review of 10/10 mainly for the simple reason that I want it to succeed and have the ample attention and time to straighten itself out. If I'm being truly honest I would say overall season 1 was a 7.5-8/10 in earnest but of course all good things need the time to grow.
833,"It's interesting to see other reviews give this groundbreaking series a low score because they don't ""get it."" The point of this show (and the book it's based on) is not to sell you something you don't already know. Racism is bad. Love is powerful. Sexism is man's downfall. Magic is dangerous. Monsters are real and take many, many forms. The great thing about Lovecraft Country is that it conveys all of these nuggets of knowledge to the audience in a way that never ceases to be entertaining and continually surprises. It doesn't preach but remains emotionally moving, artfully blending American history with speculative fiction. It seemlessly fuses the visual aesthetic of 1954 with the auditory intensity of contemporary hip hop music. Its characters are relatable, no matter your race, gender, orientation, age, or origin. But above all the wonderfully refreshing takes Lovecraft Country has of the American midwest, magic, monsters, and all the scientific wonders inbetween, this show is simply well-written, well-produced, and well-acted. There is not a single weak link or mediocre episode in the lot. It is one of the best things on television right now. It is firmly placed on the short list of shows that truly have a little bit of everything."
834,"The history, acting, the writing etc. Has me wanting more. For me the language could be to a minimal, but I absolutely love these series. It's a must see, it brings the history of blacks with a twist. Def needs a season 2!!"
835,"Hope everyone to see this show it is really good, I love it."
836,"Something that was needed to be seen and played out on TV. A lot of negative reviews are from white people who are scared of the truth and black who refuse to learn the truth. The fact there's a show with an all black cast, is science fiction, dabbles in voodoo/hoodoo and witchcraft and a race war all rolled into one is truly beautiful!!! From the great cast line up choice to costumes to special effects crew doing nothing but A1 imagery and to bring it to life; you couldn't ask for a better show at this time. Lovecraft Country is truly a masterpiece!!! Wish it was more than 10 episodes for season one but I cannot wait to see what's in store for season two!!!!"
837,This show is fantastic. There is something for every genre. HBO has a hit on its hands.
838,"With episodes full of cultural references and 'easter eggs', this show is along the same vein as Supernatural and Grim. The characters are multidimensional and we can relate that they are like people we know or no one we've ever met or want to meet. Imaginative, colorful, accurate, visually beautiful and true to the genre, the episodes deserve multiple viewings to get the full effect of each action packed show. Highly recommended!!"
839,This show is GENIUS!!!!!! I have nothing left to say about that. Simply GENIUS!!!
840,"Phenomenal series. Satisfying to see black people have sooo much empowerment during such a time. Man, this show will forever be in my top 5!"
841,"I love this show, and it surpassed my expectations. I cried in a couple of the episodes, and it had a great ending that I didn't see coming. I love how it entangles history with fantasy, and I respect how it doesn't shy away from the brutality that actually happened in our country. I haven't seen anything like it, and I found it very uplifting, inspirational, and satisfying. Very bloody, some parts I had to look away, but the scariest part of this show was watching what people actually did to other human beings, legally. I highly recommend anyone watch this, if you don't have a strong stomach, watch it anyway and look away at the gory parts, it has a great storyline that had me anxious every week for a new episode to come out. Good acting, I loved Leti, who is probably the most gorgeous actress I have seen in a very long time. Hope to see her in more roles, and hope that they make more creations like Lovecraft Country, I loved it. Reminded me of the feeling I get when I read a really great novel, and the originality was very refreshing."
842,"Being a huge H.P. Lovecraft fan, I was drawn by the title of this series, but apart from weird supernatural goings-on and some nasty monsters, there's little that relates to Lovecraft's literary universe. But I still got hooked on this show, it's highly original and fascinating. It's not easy to categorize it, there's historical drama, horror, creatures, magic and sorcery, secret societies and even some sci-fi, all put together in what could have become a chaotic hotchpotch, but in fact turned out as a more or less coherent and indeed very involving story. With as an important constant factor the appalling discrimination and slighting of black people in post WW-II America.The set-designs flawlessly evoke the atmosphere of the fifties in fashion, interiors and cars, and the special effects are spectacular with some pretty heavy gore, especially the shape-shifting sequences are truly impressive. The acting of all major characters is great, with special mentioning of Jurnee Smollett as Leti and Wunmi Mosaku as Ruby.In short: weird but absolutely worth-while."
843,"Truly Incredible storytelling. I didn't come in with any expectations, except maybe some weird monsters with the Lovecraft connection. The stories flow well together in to a narrative on race and history that was sometimes difficult to see from a white perspective. But the stories of tribulation and horror were a perfect medium for the story of a Black family tangled up with dark magic and powerful white men who want to use that family for their own gain.I also appreciated the female perspective in this show, women being punted to the side so the men could make decision. These women took back their power and their voices and it was phenomenal to watch.I'm sure plenty have said more better than I could, but damn Lovecraft Country was an incredible ride. Emotional, intense, action-packed, frightening, beautiful and full of love. I loved every minute of it and hope there will be a season 2."
844,"I absolutely love the show. I'm debating if a second season would be worth it because it could really either be as great or a major let down. I love sci-fi and black history and to have them both together was such a dream. I'm also upset that books like these exist and I've never been introduced to them or not given a hint that they exist. I admit it gets hard to follow in the beginning because there's so much to take in, but it all comes together in the end. There are no filler episodes and every episode has a meaning. The bad reviews seem to be the same and the show probably just wasn't for them. But, it was definitely for me."
845,"I love this show, the way it ties into events of the past for that era is awesome. That's the part that makes it believable for me in the midst of the supernatural events occurring you have real life events that are reflected upon. The acting, writing and visual effects are phenomenal. Every week it's harder and harder to wait for the next show! I hope there is a second season."
846,"It's got everything you could ask for in a series. It's set in recent history and mixes the occult, magic, and the social aspects of the 60's in a seemless manner. I highly recommend watching this show."
847,"Great mixture of sci-fi, horror and history. The acting script and soundtrack are excellent. My only concern is that I have to wait for season too.P.S. the racism in some of these comments is appalling."
848,At the start of the season I passed over the show because I thought the contents would be insightful to me. I buckled down and watched the first episode and I was hooked. The chemistry between the main characters is perfect and the focus on the other characters always leave me wishing I could buy the entire season right now. I look forward to each new episode and I find myself re watching past episodes for Easter Eggs I may have missed.
849,"Best show on TV right now! It's so good! And it's like every genre in one. Science Fiction, Fantasy, Drama, Horror, Adventure... Love this series."
850,"This is one of the most original shows on HBO Max. The show is great, hoping we get more content like this in the future."
851,"When I first started watching this show, I was confused and really couldn't get into it. However, I kept watching. Then I joined the discussion groups and started listening to the podcast. Now, I love the show. The show runner and producers are geniuses. They have taken a book and added other historical items to give viewers a history lesson with each episode. It also shows how horror becomes history when the episodes highlight moments in black history like The Tulsa Massacre and Emmett Till. I hope they give this show multiple seasons."
852,I'm completely in love with this show !! It's amazing
853,"I absolutely LoveCrafty Country.
The shows is so raw authentic to me ! I Iove how it ties black culture together from our history to spirituality!
Kudos to Misha for bringing the words from a book to life and including the black sci-fi community!"
854,We started watching this show with no background knowledge and it is awesome! The way they combined sci-fi & fantasy is perfect! If you want to be entertained this is for you!
855,"This show is amazing and that's selling it short. I love the characters, the storyline, our heroes. This show satisfied my inner nerd like nothing else. I actually do research on some of the things happening or mentioned in the show. I have already rewatched everything episode twice and will probably watch it a third time before the finale on Sunday. I absolutely recommend"
856,"I love this show! I am not a huge fan of ""horror"" but this show has me on the edge of my seat every episode. It is simply fantastic."
857,"Everything is amazing from the factual historical references, to the amazing actors and story lines. I can't wait for the next season!"
858,"In reference to new user (tizzy-76248) comments about the 5.3 star rating and suggesting that it's due to non-African Americans, that's absolutely absurd, I'm not African American but I rated the show a 9.0 and that was before I read your ridiculous review. The fact is not everyone is an H.P. Lovecraft fan or sci-fi fan, besides it's the first episode with only 101 reviews, look at the rating of the first episode it has a 7.1 star rating. It's not uncommon for people who were involved in a movie or show to sign up on IMDB and give a terrible movie a 10 star rating, while other users give a lower score for an excellent show or movie for numerous reasons that has nothing to do with who's in the show and some don't give out high ratings ever. I'm a fan of H.P. Lovecraft's work and I think the show is great including cast."
859,"This show is based of the Lovecraft Country a
Novel by Matt Ruff. This show has everything; Black Girl Magic, Sci-Fi, History, Horror, a Love Story, Family Drama, Magic, Art, Music, Imagination and a whole lot more. It's a reminder of how far Black Folks have come from Slavery, a Jim Crow South, and Tulsa just to name a few. The cast is outstanding!!! The story line is engaging!! The special effects are mind-blowing! I could go on and on... If you don't understand how amazing this show has been written, directed and casted; I feel sorry for you."
860,The first episode was great . Racists are intentionally giving the show a low rating because of what Lovecraft Country highlights in the Series. While fighting Monsters the True evil is the racism the Protagonists faced throughout. Watch Lovecraft you won't be disappointed.
861,"It's a perfect non-linear journey that hits on so many levels. It's Bob's and weaves through history, genres, styles, languages, and so much more. It's complex story telling at its best."
862,"Beautiful show! The actors, the stories and the creativity are all fantastic! The sci-fi story is fun and takes you on an enjoyable ride! I love how the story also gives a good visual representation of racism through black lenses and I would hope that most people would watch and learn and hopefully gain a greater understanding of the many injustices that have and still exist. I am grateful for this show and look forward to future seasons!"
863,Lovecraft county is unique and important for all black people. Horror drama and history all together
864,"Interesting to see the wide variety of opinions on this show.My wife and I absolutely loved it but I get that the time shifts and sub-plots can be difficult to follow unless you concentrate. Certainly it veered away from where you thought it might be heading after the first couple of episodes, but many of the loose ends came together as the show moved along, right up to the final episode.Frankly we can't wait for a second series."
865,This show was absolutely phenomenal from the plot to the actors. It had me excited weekend and week out to see the next episode. The plot can be a little hard to follow at times but if you just read the book or ever go watch some YouTube videos you will be able to follow along really well. Can't wait for season two. 96/100
866,"Not sure why people get so upset that it brings up racism and whatever else so much? It's a part of history and oddly enough it wasn't too long ago, segregation ended in the 60's.. After watching this I don't hate men or white people. People that feel like they're being guilted while watching this have deeper problems. If you looked past your uncomfortable feelings you'd find a pretty cool show. The plot is sort of everywhere in the beginning but after a few episodes you get their adventures. It's very artistic and has great deep meanings. It's not only about the racism but the emotional background behind the situations that they face. I don't know.. it's a fun show. That being said, I'm not really sure why they chose some of the music that they did.... It's sort of off putting to the atmosphere of the show."
867,"Undeniably original in almost all aspects.
Though, it is really not for everyone, the extreme violence is all over, and when i say ""EXTREME VIOLENCE"" i don't mean slashers, vampire, werewolfs, nor Zombies.
It is way extreme than my recent memories of art can help me.
Still, well done, nice story, nice script, great CGI."
868,"First : this is no PC exercise, it's a honest depiction of Jim Crow.
Second : the acting is excellent esp the character of Atticus. But all the other cast also superb.
Third: the soundtrack is almost it's own character.
Fourth: the story may seem convoluted but it all melds in place.
Fifth : see 4 ur self really great series."
869,"When I first heard of this show last year around this time, I was instantly excited and ready for the places it would take my imagination. It is a period piece, set mostly in chicago in the 1950s a period in american history rife with racism. They did not paint a sparkling picture of peace and harmony and I appreciate the realism of that especially in showing what was done to Emmet Till.
The fantasy of it comes in the form of magic stolen by white people from indigenous people and used to give themselves elite status over others. It is called lovecraft country because of similar places from HP Lovecraft's stories and the use of some of his creations but also illuminating Lovecraft's racist point of view that is littered throughout his many bodies of work.
The show is beautifully written, well directed and highly deserving of a season 2 especially after and explosive and somber finale.
It will open eyes, take you for a walk in someone else's shoes. And it'll show you very little has changed since the period in which the show takes place.It's a must watch and I recommend it to all."
870,"You can't watch this show if you're not able to dig deep and THINK. There's so many hidden messages and lessons in the show and I love how they intertwined real events from history into the storyline. This is a black show, but anyone can watch it. The negative reviews are from people being sensitive about the racism. It takes place in the 50's for God's sake. Get over yourselves people. If you're white and not racist and seeing racism doesn't ruffle your feathers as it shouldn't then you should definitely check it out."
871,"Ok... Gil Scot Heron's 'Whitey's on the Moon' - drops mic, continues watching, nuff said."
872,"The first sode sets the bar a bit high but the overall the series is quirky, unpredictable, engaging, fun, astonishing and overall one of the best of the season."
873,"I have been trying to recall the last time I watched a TV series that captivated me from the beginning and held my attention throughout. This series did. It's so well written, acted, directed and filmed. It's stunningly beautiful to watch. The soundtrack is brilliant, expertly weaving modern songs into a 1950's sci-fi, horror drama. If you're expecting a show based on HP Lovecraft (the racist), you'll be disappointed. It is NOT about him. It's almost impossible to classify this show, as it has elements of so many different genres, but horror + science fiction are the closest descriptions. The social commentary is subtle and in your face at the same time. It's sad that a show from the 50's is so relevant today, but it is and that's just a fact. For me, this show is epitomizes why one can never answer the question ""When exactly was America great?"" when ""Make America Great again"" is stated. What period of time, exactly, does the statement refer to? It certainly can't be the 50's because, as this show illustrates, it wasn't so great for a significant portion of the population. The overt racism is painful to watch, but it's realistic and expertly portrayed. And if you feel that it's over the top, I invite you to do some research and learn a thing or 100. I highly recommend this show, as well as the podcast (Lovecraft Country Radio) that will help you with any subtleties you may have missed."
874,"I think this is one of the best series I've ever seen. The show is based on a novel by Matt Ruff with interpolations of Lovecraftian themes and villains, but it really is a standalone series. For all of those saying the show is racist isn't digging deep enough to realize that racism is a horror for some people. Using events of the time period, magic, and monsters really helps tell a family story. We see all of these individuals with their own traumas trying to overcome these things while bending time and fighting shoggoths. It's important to watch this show with no expectations, but an open mind, and an astute eye. Watch it twice and sometimes with captions sometimes. It's a very rich and well written show. The actors are all superb and the music scoring and use of spoken word really helps boost the narrative."
875,"It would be easy to say that this show is overly focused on the issues of racism in the 1950s. There are those who might be frustrated that the white characters are mostly one dimensional (and that dimension is pretty evil). But that's like a child complaining that his medicine is too bitter - it may not taste great but the show subtly makes you better and wiser.To be certain there are weaker moments. For example, discovering a buried ship with an ancient two-souled guardian felt very much like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade meets the Goonies meets Middlesex- it was incoherent and failed to tell an intersex indigenous story with the same thoughtfulness it tells Black stories. BUT that's where the show is brilliant - the Indigenous Two Spirit story is minimized and them extinguished by a gay Black man. So the weaker moments, lags in action or in plot, serve a longer game metaphor of human identity intersectionality, dynamics of power, and magic as a stand in for privilege. And it is all also kind of BS because it is a hell of its characters own making as often as it is not.This show, like any good speculative fiction is a series of windows and mirrors. And often the folks who seem to hate it actually just hate what the mirror is telling them."
876,"This series is art, history, and cutting edge all at the same time! Misha Green and her crew are phenomenal in crafting this multi-layered work of art. This show captures how the black experience in Jim Crow America was indeed a horrific experience told using sci-fi, adventure, and horror lenses all while sprinkling current day references to ongoing oppressive themes within the black experience. I am obsessed with this show and watch each episode multiple times. So much depth and creativity. Way to flip the narrative of racist, stereotypical tropes!!"
877,"Each episode is wrote wonderfully wrote and based off Lovecraft Country by Matt Ruff. Not the racist books by HP Lovecraft.
The main characters struggle against two kinds of monsters: Racist white people and monsters. Majority are the evils done my white people even to this day.In addition, there are easter eggs and foreshadowing if you may attention. You do need a certain level of intelligence to fully understand and appreciate this work of art. It's not for those who enjoy mindless thinking shows."
878,"I love that this series intersperses historical events into the phantasmigorical storylines. This is not a show to play for background noise. You have to pay close attention to understand the subtle and not-so-subtle gems dropped referencing African American history. I love how Lovecraft;s legacy is trampled on with the strength of resolve inherent in these characters, I cannot wait to read Ruff's book since I threw away my Lovecraft anthology since discovering how much of a racist he was,"
879,Every Sunday night I am glued to my television. Lovecraft Country has got my full attention. Yes it's Sci-fi but it's so much more. This is the only show where I've joined a group to breakdown each episode for. I even bought The Negros Green Book Travel Guide. This show has turned me into a geek and I LOVE It!!!!
880,This show brings to the forefront everything that seems to be imperative for the world to know at this time. The creators of this show hit the mark when they chose to bring this book to the big screen. Each Sunday I make it my duty to join the millions of others who chose to dive into the world of Atticus and his mission to find his rightful place in this world and take it by force. Kuddos to the writers and directors. I love Lovecraft
881,"This show is absolutely mind blowing. It has me on my seat throughout every episode. I like how history is woven into the plot to give references for the time frame, while at the same time using music to do the same. The actors do an excellent job of making you relate to their characters and see them as though you know them. Television is very fickle but I hope to see another season of Lovecraft Country."
882,"Where do I begin??!! Lovecraft Country combines all my favorite subjects into one seamless and thrilling series. The empowerment, the uplifting, the acting, the fashions, the magic, the chemistry, and the historical references of it all!! Between the show, the podcast, the discussion groups and twitter, we are committed to this show. So many scrumptious nuggets of plot twists and Easter eggs. It's such an anticipated day when the show is airing. Totally worth every nail-biting second."
883,"Lovecraft Country hits all drums- acting, fantastic plot, and great writing. Oh- and it's authentic. As an African American to see yourself represented in a genre where you've been absent....fabulous!"
884,This show been in fire! I love the creative within the show. I love how all the actors and actresses are black! Yes I already know there are few actors/actresses. I haven't see so much with incredible acting skills!
885,"With each episode it gets better and better! This show makes you think, has hidden gems, and bends genres. You can watch each episode many times and find something new each time. Not to mention the acting is impeccable!"
886,"History, horror, suspense all in one. I always go in thinking the new episode can not possibly be better than the next.. and I am wrong each time."
887,"I was a bit unsure if I would enjoy the show because I'm not as familiar with all of Lovecraft's work. But then I read that it was based off of another book, so I dove in. I've now read the source material, look forward to the after show podcast and additional information provided with each episode. I love watching something true to my history with a twist! I learn something and fall in love with each character every episode as it develops. Hoping for many more seasons!!!"
888,"A much needed, highly intellectual series, with just the right amount of horror. Growing up an H P Lovecraft fan, I couldn't have dreamed of a better series. Great job, excellent casting, script writing and overall acting. Bobby Hemmitt should be proud!"
889,"This show has invented a new genre and I love it! It is a cross between historical fiction and science fiction. From the actors, costumes, and storyline the writers have brought Lovecraft Country to life in an intricately meaningful, and thoughtful way. I AM a loyal viewer and fan for life."
890,"This series has so many layers. Tremendous acting. Historical facts that we now take for granted are shown as the horrors that they really were at that time. Surprises in every episode. Mashup of history, horror, romance, drama, family trauma, space fantasy -- all executed exceedingly well."
891,This is one of the most creative and amazing shows. I love the layers of history and little gems of trivia sprinkled throughout every episode. It is a wonderful escape! Please continue with several seasons!!!!!!!!
892,"Great show!!! Beautifully shot,great storyline and superb acting."
893,"Lovecraft Country is excellent storytelling, casting, acting, directing. Everything about this show calls me back week after week. Love, horror, racism, magic, history, adventure, fantasy...the list goes on and on, because there's a little bit of everything in Lovecraft Country. Definitely my favorite new show of 2020!"
894,What a great merge between history and fantasy. It's one of those shows you really have to watch mindfully. There are so many historical references and the fantasy/horror just ascends it to another level. Well done to the cast/crew of this amazing show.
895,This show has everything from action to romance to mystery to syfy to REAL LIFE! I enjoy that it's both objective and subjective as a parallel to the viewers. Able to see the hard truths of life and easy outs of privilege for a much needed larger discussion. Great job to all involved!
896,I love the history lessons and historical references. Great story telling by the talented writers. Can't wait until next season's journey.
897,"There's so much to love about this show I'm not sure where to begin. Everything from storyline, to cast, to cinematography, to music is spot on. I especially appreciate the journey through actual historical events and how it pushes Americans especially those who've been shielded by so much privilege to reckon with their past."
898,"This show allows storytelling to be truthful, unabridged, and undying good writing, directing, acting, and scene design to come to life. So many dimensions and you can talk about each episode for weeks at a time. This has been some great storytelling. It also gives a great account of historical references and it's effects. I will definitely re-watch the series as it comes to a close. Amazing show."
899,This is a phenomenal show! The characters are multifaceted and the historical references of racism and hate ring true today as much as it did then. The supernatural elements are wholly entertaining and keep you glued to the screen. Excellent acting and writing!
900,"First, I want to start off by saying Jurnee deserves an Emmy AFTER THIS SHOW! Long over due!!!The usage of horror to dramatize the ugliness of racism, BRILLIANT! This show is hands down one of my favorite TV shows to watch! The acting is spot on! I appreciate how careful Misha Green is with telling so many stories of the African Americans plight in America. The show is filled with fantasy, love, horror, and history lessons from across many cultures. I can't get enough of this show and I will be sad when this season comes to an end! If you haven't watched this show, go to HBO RIGHT NOW and click on the very first episode, it will not disappoint."
901,"I stumbled upon this by accident and have been hooked ever since. I love the historical references especially and it has the right mix of sci fi, Supernatural, socio-political issues and history. I find myself watching the episodes over and over again and finding things I have missed. The glaring view of racism may be too much for some but to some degree it shows even though much has improved, much hasn't changed. I love the show and I hope there is a second season."
902,"This is the only show one that teaches Black history and scares the crap out of you at the same time. It's truly unique, captivating, and a true gem in a sea full of redundant shows on TV. I really hope this is renewed because we need to see more of this!"
903,"This show is provocative, enraging and often horrific is its themes and story lines. Each episode takes you into a fantasy world that is perfect for the devils, demons and sinners. The angels are hiding. The show takes place in the 1950's and all the racism that comes with it. The reality of today's brutal world is meshed in seamlessly as it shows how things really have not changed. Then you add the magic and the demons, monsters in both alien and human form and you have the formula for an amazing and thrilling adventure with Atticus Freeman Leti Lewis and all the other characters."

909,"I don't know where to start, I am grateful for the show it so entertaining. Black history Horror"
910,"The shows gives insight into the horrors of racism, it has a great plot and the audience becomes invested into the characters. It is a adaption of HP Lovecraft's novels, the negative reviews are the people that are disappointed on how the show has cleverly used Lovecraft's racist narrations to empower a group of men and women that some want to
Desperately oppress"
911,I'm in love with EVERYTHING about LoveCraft Country! The cast is amazing! The writing is superb! I love how out of the box it is! The educational pieces and history nuggets and cultural substance it delivers in every episode is so needed. This show is so very relevant and necessary. I love it!

THANK YOU FOR A MIX OF SIFI AND BLACK HISTORY THANK YOU FOR EDUCATING PPL WHO DOESNT KNOW THE STRUGGLES HURT OF BLACK PPL"
914,"I absolutely love this series! It depicts the history of African-Americans in the the State's of1950s era, forcing one to research historical facts. It reminds me of the horror stories my grandparents,parent and other relatives had experienced in the South and then relocating to the Midwest. I really wish they were still here to see their and many others stories on screen."
915,"Bravo! Misha Green and the amazingly talented cast members, special effects, costume, and historical researchers have done an astonishing job or creating a dizzying array of fantasy and facts blended together in edge-of-your-seat adventure. Brilliant exploration of the Jim Crow era and the desires for freedom, self actualization, love and power. This series has just the right combination of horror, drama, and science fiction. It is a high-minded piece of art and my absolute pleasure to be part of HBO's movement to give everyone a voice. Feeling all of it!!"
916,"From the musical choice to the casting of characters, every aspect meshes perfectly into the story. This might go over the heads of some who would know nothing about American history, but it's still quite a great ride! Mixing sci-fi, magic and the reality that so many had no choice but to live in, Lovecraft Country keeps me wanting MORE after every episode and I can't wait for the next!"
917,"In a genre dominated by white people, LCC is exactly what the world needs to see...great black actors killing the SciFi/Horror game...with intelligence, grit, & black history. Keep up the fantastic work. Hope there is a Season 2 HBO!"
918,"The combination of history and fantasy in one fiction from the Black American perspective and set in the mid 20th century, this show is genius!I have a very deep appreciation for this show and everyone in involved in its creation!!!"
919,"This show is Brilliant! Cutting edge, sci-fi horror meets American horror with amazing writers, directors and actors. I had no idea how badly I needed this show in my life. Misha Green- I bow down to your excellence. This is the beauty of Black creatives. I love how this show has created a community of like minded people to come together and dissect the intricate pieces of this show and find the Easter eggs and bread crumbs from the writer's room. Plus the podcast is an excellent edition to help breakdown the show. We LOVE THIS SHOW and I look forward to MORE!!!"
920,Excellent show that does not mind getting to brass tactics!!! This show speaks of the history balck folks endured then and now. Much needed and at the right time to educate the people!!
921,Saying I was on the edge of my seat tonight is an understatement!!!! I am in such awwwww of the actors and actresses and the creators. I haven't seen an episode I disliked. The show touches on history & definitely challenges the viewers. Every week when we think we know all of the clues. The Podcast gives us other views we never would have thought.
922,"An edge of your seat, thought provoking joy ride. I have to watch each episode twice to take in all the nuances and nuggets. Top of the line cast with a Supernatural twilight feel. I'm in love And can't wait for Sunday's!"
923,My new favorite show! The actors are amazing! I love the historical accounts that are provided in every episode. If you're not knowledgeable of Black history then you might not understand or catch some things. The characters are fighting real life monsters one being racists in the 1950's Jim Crow era.
924,I love this show from the plots to the easter eggs just everything!!!
925,"Brilliant, Action packed & full of history & excitement!"
926,This show is so amazingly well written and intertwined with black history and a true perspective of the black experience in America. Perfect timing for this show!
927,HBO completely OUTDID themselves with this show! OMG I LOVE IT!!!!!!!
928,"There is nothing like Lovecraft County, so there isn't a movie or tv show that it could be compared to. It is an adventure and history lesson with every episode. Each episode is so dynamic that each one could be its own movie. The writers, producers, actors, and every single person who contributed to this production did an awesome job! Never have I watched something that has had me so invested! I love this show!"
929,This is one of the best shows I have watched this year. I eagerly count the days down until the next episode. I don't know what I'm gonna do when the season is over!
930,This show allows people of color's versatility come to life on-screen and will become a cult classic.
931,I love everything about this show!!!! A true to life look at historical events in America from the Black perspective with sci-fi and horror sprinkled in!!! Watch this show and you will learn so much!
932,This show is sooooo Amazing. Ive never read the book so I cant compare. But I enjoy the themes of each episode. The cast is marvelous
933,Excellent show. Just brilliant. The story line to the actors and actresses are superb
934,"This is an amazing Tv show, I love the details referring to the past and present while being black in America!!!! Lovecraft country is amazingly put together as well as the cast.....Looking forward to season 2!!!!!!!!!!"
935,I watch each episode at least twice. Once with no captions then again with the captions. I've never seen a period piece with such historically accurate Black American sentiments. The writers are amazing and it's dreadfully easy to see how many White Americans would miss the depth of the show. The correlations between racism and horror are beautifully displayed. This show is clearly from a Black American human's gaze. It has different levels of depth based on the emotion intelligence and maturity of the viewer. So whoever says this show lacks depth or variety... is literally speaking of themselves.
936,"VERY INFORMATIVE & KNOWLEDGEABLE!!! Love the mix of sci-fi, horror with black history."
937,"I absolutely love this show. It's up there with GOT and LOST for me with the quality of acting, originality, mystery, and cross-genre story-telling. There's a whole lot of magic, sci-fi, horror, love, tragedy, history, and drama that keeps you wanting for more! It's like Trublood, Fringe and American Horror Story had the coolest baby ever.I truly hope there will be a season 2,3,4&5! I honestly think ppl get too sensitive about whites being depicted as horrible cruel people. They were that way in the 50's! (I'm not black btw) I love how all the main characters are black, and that the writers , producers, make up/costume artists are all black. It's about time!!! There is so much untapped talent from minorities in general. This show unabashedly tears down the door and walls around it!"
938,"The depth and profundity of this show is like no other. Beautifully, wonderfully, magnificently infusing history and horror episode after episode. Kudos Misha Green and HBO!"
939,This show is outstanding!!!! It has a lot of major easter eggs.
940,Lovecraft Country is so groundbreaking. The CGI is Outstanding!!! I am surprised by all the Easter Eggs in the show and the beautiful real poetry that is from black artist.This show gives what truly is horror...racism.
941,The show is so good. Tells a story and has deep undertones.
942,I'm in love how this movie takes you though so many emotions. I love how they implement black history into the storylines and make you feel it in a way you never have before.
943,I really like this show its different from what usually watch with a Sci Fi twist!!
944,"This show is non stop creative genius, the character development is amazing, Misha Green is outstanding. It really taps into the real Horrors that are the fabric of American history with a twist..."
945,"I've been waiting all of my life for a horror/ thriller like this. Amazing! Thank you Ms. Green and all the writers for trusting my intellect and making me research, think, Google, read, laugh and cry."
946,"Let's first start off by understanding that this show is not based on H.P. Lovecraft's writings. Please stop judging the show based on that. If you want to be whisked away into Lovecraft's mind, turn off HBO and pick up a book.It's great that they showed historical context of racism and anti-blackness in America. This show is engaging and leaves you wanting more. After each episode my partner and I have beautiful conversations about the Black experience for both women and men and where we see that reflected in each episode. There is clever placement of Black culture themed ""Easter eggs"" in particular episodes I.e showing Bessie Stringfield the first Black motorcyclist to travel cross country. Being able to see that racism, racial profiling, disinvestment in the Black community, redlining etc. didn't all start with Trump. That has been a refreshing and relieving antidote for the craziness of the world right now. This show has been uplifting to African-Americans esp. given the state of our country right now.Also my boyfriend and I have been THOROUGHLY scared by all different types of monsters they've shown... overt racists, covert racists, homophobics, bigots, brutal police, ACTUAL monsters, classist structures, complicity with racism and more. Also I think the CGI is 7/10. It's been very believable."
947,"This show will be talked about for a long time to come, I love everything about the show, the cast, the story line. I impatiently wait for each episode."
948,"Action pack!
History!
Black History!
Magic!
Horror!
Sci-fi!
Art!
This series have EVERYTHING and the actors are phenomenal at it!"
949,"I've been waiting all my life for a show like this, that included people that looks like me. This show has taught me so much, in just this short period of time. Kudos to everyone that's apart of this show."
