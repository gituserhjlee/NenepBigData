0,"Took the grandkids to this movie...they didn't think it was very good. It seems like something that was produced for the dollars it could make rather than a story that needed to be told.The good: it was not very long. The colors are brilliant and visually stimulating. Max was remade with a little more of a fun personality.The bad: Grinch somehow seemed wrong. I'm not sure if it was the voice, the artistic effects, or just a general un-Grinchiness. The story was a retelling that didn't need to be. The biggest negative is the feeling that this movie is forgettable.I'm sure I'll never watch it again. I've watched the original about a billion times, and the Jim Carrey version nearly the same.Bottom line...save your money and rent it later."
1,I just didn't like it. I love the book I read it from November onwards every year to my kids. I love both the older versions but this just got diluted down until it was a poor version of a Christmas movie. The odd funny moments but nothing else. There was nothing mean or awful about the grinch at all he was quite nice to begin with just a lonely sad man who needed friends
2,"They picked the absolute worst voice for the Grinch. Also the Grinch didn't even seem bad. In fact, its like a five year old would have considered this movie less than a G rating. The Grinch is known to have a hard stare and grin with a rough voice. They ruined this version."
3,"When the movie ended, I looked over at my family and asked ""did they even sing the grinch song?"" which I was highly anticipating with a fun, new modern edge. my nephew responded with ""it was a remix and not the whole song"" what?! Jim Carey made an entire scene out of it! This movie was a let down. Can they stop remaking movies if they're going to be lazy and unoriginal about it? The Jim Carey one and the original Grinch are way better than this"
4,"Illumination is a studio known for producing gutless, boring, paint-by-numbers, mass appeal movies that focus more on cute gimmicks and marketing than they do on actual storytelling and character development. If you've seen anything else from Illumination, you practically don't need to see this movie, because you can probably just predict every scene in your head and just about get it right. While The Grinch isn't Illumination's worst, it's still a thoughtless and emotionless product only meant to sell toys and theater tickets before charm and charisma.Benedict Cumberbatch's Grinch is boring. I do like Cumberbatch and I did think he'd be great to voice the Grinch, but he's terrible in this movie. His voice doesn't match the character whatsoever, and does nothing to bring the character more to life. At least Jim Carrey put energy and emotion into his performance, whereas Cumberbatch sounds like he's disappointed about the small paycheck he's just been given. The Grinch himself is written in a way that pulls all punches and has to cave in to cutesy kids logic instead of a clever way that tells a good story. Instead of making The Grinch actually funny or interesting, they make him the typical 2018 grumpy hipster who's a good guy at heart but just needs his morning coffee. Making him a mostly good character really undermines the climactic payoff of him finally understanding the meaning Christmas towards the end.Sadly, both the character and the overall movie as a whole share the same problems; it's boring, uninspired, and vanilla. Much like the character, the movie sucks out anything interesting in favor for playing it safe and selling toys. The music is even done by rapper Tyler The Creator, and even as a moderate fan of his work, the music here is terribly uninspired and obviously an attempt to make the film more hip. Most of the jokes are entirely predictable. Actually, the entire movie is predictable. I don't mean we've seen the original movies, I mean the film follows every generic story you'll ever see in a kids movie. The film feels more like it was written by a computer and less like a team of engrossed screenwriters. One of the film's running gags is the ex-popular 'screaming goat' meme...seriously, I thought that meme stopped being funny in 2013.Truthfully, this film is not the worst thing to come out of Illumination. It may not be a good movie, but at least it doesn't completely bastardize and miseducate its message like The Lorax did, and at least it isn't as excruciatingly for-the-masses as Minions or The Secret Life Of Pets. The Grinch, as well as every single other Illumination Studios movie, is like a cute untamed puppy; it may urinate on your rug and chew up all of your shoes, but it's cute and looks at you with big puppy dog eyes and does silly things, so you don't punish it and let it slide when it really shouldn't be forgiven so easily. When are we as an audience going to stop letting these thoughtless movies slide solely because of their cuteness? Regardless, moms and kids alike will continue to enjoy these movies without the slightest care, simply because it's cute and nothing more."
5,"If you've seen the trailer you've seen the whole movie. It's funny, yes, but the trailer ruins it as it has included every single joke from the movie."
6,Worst adaptation of the grinch ever made. Stick to what you know and what people love....the original cartoon. Too much overacting.
7,"Anyone who gave this a bad rating clearly is just upset because, they don't like a modern Grinch because they grew up with the original classic Grinch cartoon. This movie was one of the most adorable and fun feel-good animated movies I've seen in a long time. Benedict Cumberbatch killed it as the Grinch and, all the gadgets and grandeur of the grinches holiday heist scene is so creative and colourful and fantastical! This is one of the greatest Christmas movies of all time up there with Nightmare before Christmas. This movie was a joy to watch and if you couldn't find joy in this movie maybe, you're the Grinch."
8,"It is the classic story of The Grinch we all know so well. So yes its predictable, yes we know what's going to happen and how it ends, but even so it was a joy to watch and the kids really enjoyed it. This version of the grinch is a little less disgusting and you see a bit more kindness from him, which I liked. It had quite a few laughs and some very sweet moments. I personally liked it better than the Jim Carry version. But nothing beats the original."
9,"The movie was a drag, the grinch looked way to young and always acted like he had regrets about everything. The narrator voice and singing were horrible. I wish I could just get my money back. It's good for little kids or people who don't really care what a good story is."
10,"I honestly do not get the impressionable casuals who say that any critic who dislikes a movie they like is wrong. Using that logic, YOU'RE wrong for liking it. But that's not true, because it's all subjective. With that out of the way, allow me to explain why I didn't like this movie:It's dull and boring. It's not interesting, it's only funny in certain places and even then it only resulted in a small smile. If what's advertised to me as a comedy movie isn't that funny to me, I think it's failed as a movie. This could've had the potential to be a pretty decent movie and it's not the first time Illumination has done a Dr Seuss movie. Expectations weren't exactly through the roof, but I expected them to do so much better than this. The animation is pretty good, as expected for Illumination, but it can only dazzle me for about 5 minutes before I realise how dull and uninteresting this movie is.Again, if you liked this then good for you, but I just can't enjoy this movie."
11,"The thing about a remake is that there needs to be a reason to make it. When remakes have no reason to exist (other than to make a quick buck or millions of them), they fall flat, usually due to a lack effort. And therein lies the issue plaguing this 2018 version of Dr. Seuss' holiday classic about the mean-green-grumpy Grinch-it's a dull final product that likely resulting from a lack of effort. We know the Grinch stole Christmas, but who stole this movie's creativity?Just about everyone knows the classic Grinch story, but this one is a little bit different, so let's run through it. There's cheery, wintery town called Whoville filled with many delightful people called Whos. The Whos love Christmas, and they know how to celebrate the holiday right. They don't just deck the halls, they deck out the entire town with decorations, lights and a mountain-sized tree. It's all glorious.One young Who named Cindy-Lou (Cameron Seely) has an adventurous spirit and a kind heart, as central figures tend to have in these sorts of movies. She feels for her exhausted single mom who struggles to balance her time at work and at home taking care of Cindy-Lou and the twin boys. So, Cindy-Lou decides to ask Santa to help her mom by doing... something. Exactly what help Santa would provide is unclear, which makes any resolution problematic because we can't recognize the help if it arrives. If you think I'm overanalyzing this movie aimed at children, you're probably right.Any Who... living in the giant mountain adjacent to Whoville is The Grinch (Benedict Cumberbatch). The Grinch I remember as a child was a ruthless and nasty figure. Establishing him this way early on is crucial because it sets up a redemption story. This new Grinch starts off mildly rude at his worst and genuinely considerate at his best. A few half-hearted attempts to display his wickedness that fail and instead make him appear funny. The rest of the time, The Grinch is mostly pleasant. This robs viewers of the need to root for him to change because he's a decent guy the entire time. He politely interacts with an overly-jolly old friend, Mr. Bricklebaum, voiced by Kenan Thompson, who is doing some variation of his SNL character, neighbor Willie. Thompson's jubilance is good for a few laughs, the only ones you'll find in the movie. Despite his best efforts, his limited screen time doesn't afford him enough opportunity to earn this movie an overall label of ""funny.""The rest of the attempts at humor are comprised mostly of cutaways that play like watered down versions of ones you'd see on Family Guy. There's also a dusting of lazy Who-based puns, like the inclusion a place called Who Foods, a play on Whole Foods. Like the rest of the movie, the jokes clearly were made with little effort.There isn't much else to say. This is a pointless remake that doesn't need to exist. A remake that has a reason to exist should provide a fresh voice while simultaneously honoring the past creation. This film does neither. If you want to watch a story about The Grinch, you'd be much better off revisiting the original cartoon classic or the more recent live-action iteration starring Jim Carrey."
12,"I went to go see The Grinch with my daughter who is 8 years old and we both enjoyed it. I laughed a little more than she did but she loved it! It follows along the typical Grinch storyline but with some new characters. If you are a fan of the Grinch, this movie will not disappoint and it's especially great for the kids who seemed to all enjoy it. Overall, a great family movie that delivers a great message in the end."
13,"This is another film by illumination animation, a company known for their very cheap animation, generic cookie cutter plots, low brow humor, Pop music, and those annoying minions. Yet despite this list of grievances they are highly successful, because they make lowest common denominator movies anyone between 1 month and 100 years old could watch.This brings us to the Grinch, a needless remake that no one asked for or wanted. After the Lorax's dreadful adaptation, the quality of this trash should come as no surprise. Yet it represents almost everything wrong with entertainment; it doesn't exist because an artist was inspired to craft a loving adaptation telling a story he/she wanted to tell. It exists because it's a Dr. Seuss property and a Dr. Seuss movie prints the money itself.Anyway this movie is as lame and as generic as you could possibly imagine. The Grinch is comically sympathetic, but isn't likeable. I'm stunned that the filmmakers managed to suck out all character, nuance, and personality of the Grinch and leave him as a hollow shell who acts like an A**hole. Also the Grinch who should be a foul/gross weirdo looks too clean and basic thanks to the simplicity of the cheap animation.The townsfolk are either comically evil, ignorant, or innocent. The setting is awful and feels empty, the music sucks, and the pop music REALLY makes your ears bleed in this one folks!One positive is the color pallet, very Christmas-y and very easy on the eyes. But again the animation is so basic and simplistic that each character looks so bland and unmemorable I can't even remember more than 4 character designs.Ultimately the quality doesn't matter (the studio knows this, which is why they sold this movie out to any company that would advertise it), people will see this and it'll make over $500 million at least. If somehow you like illumination animation movies, you'll like this one. if you don't then you'll hate this."
14,"I have absolutely no idea why this movie is not getting good reviews. I'm often extremely critical of kid movies but really enjoyed every bit of this one! I loved that it taught about love and kindness and the need for people without trying to shove any political correctness down our throats. Just a really funny, really good movie! Kids laughed trough the whole thing too!"
15,"This is the prim example of a kid's movie that takes 0 risks. It doesn't do anything note worthy. I can say the movie looks good. I can say the voice acting is okay. As far as flaws go , the story is ungodly predictable and bland. This film just has no personality. By Illumination standards this is probably one of there better films , which says a lot about there movies. I thought all the designs were okay , with the exception of the Grinch himself.
He doesn't look very evil or nasty. He just kind of looks annoyed.If you have small child , there probably going to enjoy this so if you want to see a movie with them this is a fine choice. However I can't talk about this movie without mentioning how bad Tyler the Creator's remix is. It is ungodly bad and so stupid.I can see people liking this film and that's fine. Me on the other hand , I would rather watch the Jim Carry version. At least that film took risks."
16,"Wow, just plain stunk. Horrible music, narrator was awful and just overall annoying. The animation was great, but not fitting to this story. Fine they wanted something different than the other movies, but at least take a cue from the book. They should have saved the animation for a cutesy holiday story, not The Grinch."
17,"Very family oriented and clear cartoon, and got a deep idea about Christmas agenda- thanksgiving before presents.
Recommended for everyone"
18,Worst remake ever! I Absolutely despise the Grinch theme song They butchered it!
19,"I don't know what to say, really. Uninspiring? Second-tier? First of all Narrator voice, sometimes very decent, than some time you know THIS notes get slip. But its not bad like boooooooring voice acting of Benedict Cumberbatch (he don't killed AS the Grinch - he JUST killed Grinch). Why? Just why?! I know its always obvious cash-grab when in title we have THE GRINCH, like THE ONLY THING YOU CAN FIND IN GOOGLE FIRST PAGES and all sorts of Netflix-amazone-prime catalogs. I am not very amazed by Jim Carrey Grinch, but boy he in live flesh more Grinch then Cumberbatch in animation. It so lazy acting, just WOW you even don't have a little shame, guys from Illumination."
20,"No matter how much worse the IMDb rating gets, watch the movie for yourself. I love the music, the animation, the voice talents and the storyline! Aside from from having a few goofy moments, the movie was a lot more dramatic and touching."
21,"There is a reason I don't read critic reviews, and it is because I never ever agree with them. Usually when they say a movie is bad, I like it and vice versa. I like to leave reviews for movies and tv shows because I enjoy them, and I don't care about other people's views. I will give you my honest review as just a regular movie lover. Glad I didn't listen to critics on this film. It was great! A sold out theater. Kids and adults all laughed throughout the film. I went with my husband, sister, brother in law, and my niece and nephew. We all loved it equally. I enjoyed Jim Carey's version but I cannot compare them. I was wondering if I could like this without it having Jim Carey but I truly did. Heart-warming film with a slightly different take on it from the last film. To me, the dog, MAX stole the show! Great animation and effects. 3D is even better. To the people saying there was no storyline...ummm, there was! sheesh. Its about...well...THE GRINCH!! You don't take my advice, its just MY opinion, but I advise everyone to see this. Do not expect an Emmy winner, but it is still a great, warm and cozy holiday film."
22,"After seeing the trailer I felt this movie was just an attempt at a reboot of 'The Grinch that stole Christmas' featuring Jim Carrey. After the first 10 minutes my fears were realised, this film is awful. The storyline is all over the place, it wasn't easy to follow for kids and it seemed the writers were just trying their best to be as PC as possible. Out of the whole film there was 4-5 good laughs, these were good but again mostly covered off by the trailer.I could go on further, but it's easy just to say this wasn't a great attempt to reboot The Grinch."
23,"I love the original Grinch movies. This one was awful, the story was rushed there was no connection with the characters. This is more of a propaganda movie than anything. The random Christmas rap songs? Not good."
24,"The technicals of this version are outstanding, great, bright animation, very Pixar-ish. However, it fails in its heart which is always driven by actors' voicing and what a BIG FAIL this was - as many others have noted, so you know it's not just a few of us. First, WTH is Pharrell narrating?! Weakest voicing ever! NOTHING even approaching the dramatic storytelling of the classic's Karloff. And his hip-hop, rap interludes were simply wrong for this feature - maybe if you're setting the story in a rundown urban environment, maybe then it'd have fit, but it was totally out of place here. Then Benedict Cucumber-patch's voicing of our main Grinch character was way off base, nowhere up to the task, it was a pathetic reading of the script, the biggest letdown you could imagine. Finally, the naive, demure Cindy Lou Who from the classic is re-imagined as a hyper-active grrl power character which is also annoying and out of place. We can only hope this version is relegated to the dust bin of some Hollywood warehouse, never to be seen again."
25,"I wanted to walk out. It was so boring, long, not funny and honestly Cumberbatch gives a really lazy and half-hearted performance. I can't blame him though, this material was just complete trash. I can't speak for everyone, but I'm quite done with Illumination's ""spend 60 mil on the movie, and 300 mil on marketing it"" strategy. Ugh."
26,"If you're going to see this movie wait till it's on Redbox so you can rent it for a dollar. We watched it tonight, opening night, the very first showing our theater head and my husband fell asleep. Our kids got antsy. My grandpa said he didn't like it at all. And I was very disappointed. Save your money save your time and watch the original grinch cartoon that's only like 25 minutes long and you'll be a lot happier. Every funny moment in this movie with shown during the previews. And if you were hoping to see that adorable chubby reindeer for any period of time during the movie you will be disappointed also. He makes a very short appearance and everything that he does in the movie you have already seen in the previews. I didn't care for the narrators voice either. And let me tell you I am a Christmasholic. I listen to Christmas music in July. I buy Christmas presents all your long & stock them up. I usually have my Christmas tree up the first week in November. So I have been looking forward to this movie since the moment I found out it was coming out. I am so sorry I saw it."
27,"""Political correctness"" is ruining movies. The grinch in the original version you could even say was scary. He had a cruel and mean personality and Cindy Lou was lost and did not understand how who's celebrated Christmas. I was really disappointed and boared. I didn't even like the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch as the grinch. Just horrible!!!!"
28,"This movie was not needed. It's just Illumination's typical bland, unfunny humor and bland, uninteresting story. This movie reeks of laziness and cheapness, but it's from Illumination, so that much is expected. This movie is equivalent to jingling keys in front of an audience for an hour and a half.Save your money, and watch the better two Grinch movies instead. You'll remember those, but you'll forget about this one as soon as you finish it."
29,"Don't watch this movie. Trust me. Watch the classics, watch Jim Carrey, don't watch this. It is a waste of money and time and you'll regret it"
30,"Part of me was interested in seeing 'The Grinch', being a fan of the original Dr Seuss story and especially the 1966 animated version with Boris Karloff voicing Grinch (do like the Jim Carrey version better than most) and being someone who likes Benedict Cumberbatch and a lot of what he's done. Was nervous though too because the trailer did not look good, the reviews are mixed to not great and did question whether it was necessary.Dr Seuss adaptations have been very hit and miss. The animated short television specials have fared significantly better than the feature films, Dr Seuss' work lends itself better to adaptations of a short length and the television specials were not only great adaptations and true in detail and spirit but great on their own. Of the feature films, the best one is by far 'Horton Hears a Who' with the worst being the live action 'The Cat in the Hat' (to me among the worst films ever made). Illumination has also been variable, loved the first two 'Despicable Me' films while not caring for 'Minions'.Saw 'The Grinch' anyway as someone trying to see and review as many 2018 films as possible and loving the story and Christmas films, also to see how Cumberbatch would fare as Grinch. Seeing it, it is nowhere near as good as the 1966 version and is neither a Christmas cracker or a bah humbug. It is also neither among the best or worst films of the year, somewhere in the middle for me.There are definitely great things here. The animation cannot be faulted, so much gorgeous and meticulous attention to detail and rich vibrant colours that really immerses one into the world of Whoville. Some of the soundtrack has a festive and infectious feel. There are funny and emotional moments, the former with the funny and adorable (plus more interesting) Max and the latter with the Cindy Lou subplot, that and the character herself being the sweet and charming heart of the film.It is not a film without soul, having a warm glow more than once and some spirited elaborate set pieces, it does well with sticking to the spirit of the story and with the back and forth between Mount Crumpet and Whoville. It is not too long and has a lively pace generally. As said, Max and Cindy Lou are the best characters. Mostly the voice acting is good, with Cameron Seely being the clear standout.Having said all of this, 'The Grinch' could have been better. It does offer very little new or fresh, trying to be faithful to the source material while not moving enough beyond that that it all feels too safe. It could have done with more humour and heart generally, could have done without the repetitive and tired screaming goat gag and outside of the Cindy Lou subplot soul is missing.Found myself mixed on the pretty unrecognisable Cumberbatch. He does well providing a curmudgeonly touch and has moments of grinchy- meanness, plaudits too for not making Grinch too scary or resorting to excessive mugging. Do feel though that he was not mean or Grinchy-enough and he would have fared much better using his own voice for the character which would have fitted better. Had a big issue with the annoying, intrusive and over-explanatory narration that was not always necessary and with a rather out of place Pharrell Williams. Other parts of the soundtrack grated and too reminiscent of commercial music neither catchy or to my taste that didn't gel with the setting or the rest of the film. Too many of the supporting characters are forgettable and one-dimensional.Overall, better than what the critics have generally said but was rather mixed on a film with a lot of great merits but feels too safe and one does question the point of it. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
31,Look I'm probably not the target audience for this movie but I gotta say I smiled I. Laughed I felt flat out joy one of the best of the year simple sweet and fall down funny for once instead of a movie being about war it was about peice and love and joy nothing I regret about seeing this movie
32,"Cindy Lou, the sweet little ""Who"", didn't look like herself. The Grinch and Max looked like themselves, but it was a challenge getting into the film, because they got Cindy so wrong. Looked like everyday character. I didn't find anything especially funny. Compare the last Grinch movie to this one and it is definitely two thumbs down."
33,Very plain script. No added humor to the main story and characters whatsoever as one might expect from illumination. Couldnt wait to exit the theater. My kids barely sat through it.
34,"This was a horrible movie, made it worst with the narrator and rap music."
35,Jim Carey's movie was better. The movie was funny but wasnt amazing.
36,"Don't waste your time wait till this movie comes out for free it'll be one to forget they chose the wrong actors and totally changed the ""grinch"" they don't make him scary and they make it seem like who ville just accepts him like another person when what makes the grinch is people hating him"
37,"The grinch isn't angry enough andThe story line is just depressing. It's not about th grinch hating Christmas, it's about him avoiding Christmas.This just makes you wanna watch the Jim Carrey remake"
38,"I rarely watch animated movies, so I didn't expect much going into this one. I have to say I like the original and Jim Carrey ones better, but this is still fun. For a family movie, or just a movie to go see with a friend or girlfriend, I think this is a good flick to see going into the holidays! 7/10"
39,I love the actors I. It. The dog was cute. And funny moments. But the two previous grinch movies made the grinch clearly hate....loath entirely tye holiday. Where as this one made it feel like he was just avoiding. Doing his taxes. He mingled with the whos in a way that didnt even make him seem like that much of out cast. But the fault was in the writing. But still. A screaming goat is worth 8 stars lol
40,"Trashiest movie of the year. Unfunny, boring, and added nothing new to the original grinch story. First of all the whole movie the grinch was too nice to be the grinch but at the end when he finally turned nice he turned to nice to fast. The Jim Carey grinch is still the best. Trash."
41,"You'llbe laughing from the time you sit down until the credits start rolling. Heart warming and fun, it's a great movie for the whole family. And it doesn't have the terrible jokes and weird feeling of the Jim Carrey version..."
42,"I took my 7 year old to see this movie and almost fell asleep. If you think slapstick humor is funny, then this movie is for you. Its not well written, few spots to laugh at and it not even remotely what the Grinch is about. Pass on it and save a trip to the show."
43,"I can't believe people hate the Jim Carey version but then make this. I almost fell asleep several times! Not to mention they ripped off the Jim Carey version several times, gave Cindy the most ANNOYING VOICE, killed off Cindy's dad for some reason, made G more slightly depressed and lonely than hateful and angry, and changed the message from greed to ??? I don't even know. And since when do whos believe in the Bible? Why were they so religious? Surprised there were no nativity scenes. At least Pharrell always has work with Illumination."
44,"Your smaller kids will love it! Incredible animation, had fun watching it in dbox."
45,"Please don't see this movie in theatres, if you liked the prior Grinch movies, then you won't like this one. It's not mean, it's not funny, it's not accurate to the storyline. It also ruins the iconic grinch song. This isn't a very good movie and you shouldn't waste your money seeing this. Rewatch the Ron Howard and Jim Carey version over and over again to get your fix this year. I know that's what I'm going to do. So many better songs in that version as well."
46,"I'm going to keep this review short since you know the story most likely.I was enchanted by this movie from the moment it started. It was a fun animated movie, with gorgeous animation, a lot of heart, and even some humor. The 90 minute run-time makes the movie fly by.And the Grinch is evil but not scary. This has been ridiculed, but I like that the movie was trying to make it more comfortable for the little ones.The ending, even though I knew it was coming, was very uplifting. The Grinch's heart grew 3 times bigger, but guess what? So did mine!This is one of my favorite animated movies now, and my #1 Dr. Suess adaptation. This is the movie to see this holiday season!Note: If you found this review helpful, please click on cinephile-27690 to read my other reviews!"
47,"I am 64. My wife is 51. We loved it!!
Imaginative and colorful, beyond our imaginations. Heartwarming story too."
48,"Disappointed. The grinch is supposed to be the old man we are all a bit scared of. This film portrays a sad grinch. I love Benedict but I was hoping for more of a Boris voice and got weird nasally muppet instead. The look and plot were both lackluster. Pharrell was a great narrator and I enjoyed the music. I can't recommend this film for anyone over 5. All in all, just watch the original."
49,"Good film for the family, worth the money seeing it at the cinema and when it comes out on sky and when it comes out on Blu-ray"
50,"Pretty much the definition of 'average', 'The Grinch (2018)' really is just fine in every way. It's fairly impressive in terms of its visuals and voice-work but is certainly nothing new, or even compelling, when it comes to its narrative. Really, the visuals and voice-work are only really to the expected standard of today's bigger-budgeted animated fare and the strange 'Illumination-esque' designs, combined with the pulled-back (certainly from the, frankly, creepy Carrey incarnation) but still oddball Seuss stylings, prevent the piece from appearing as aesthetically-pleasing as anything that Disney - or, more specifically, Pixar - are putting out today. The point is that the fact that it looks pretty pretty isn't enough of a selling point to recommend the piece and that's probably the biggest selling point it has. I suppose someone who isn't familiar with the source-story and is young (or willing) enough not to notice the basic nature of the narrative may get more mileage from this bland but inoffensive, family-friendly Christmas flick. 5/10"
51,"The grinch was and is- great xmas movie, unfortunately Yarrow and Scott Moiser, really pushed a racial twist to it that discraces the original author, and 1st original grinch, as well as the 2nd with Jim Carey did an outstanding job in that one. This latest appears to be pushing the race card to new limits, Many in the threator voiced discust, and several got up and left. I feel sorry for Angela Landsberry to even have her name associated with something like this.Universale pictures ""great job"", if you can't tell, this is sarcasm.to even have her name associated with this class ""d"" movie that to me rates worse then ""Killer Klowns for outer Space""."
52,"The updated Grinch isn't horrible, but it isnt great. This is a kinder, gentler Grinch. The magic of the classic is the voice work of Boris Karloff. Benedict Cumberbatch and narrator Pharrell Williams just don't have the same wicked tone. I'll stick with the original."
53,Well maybe in the distant future. I mean it was watchable but not amazing. I expected it to be funnier. Benedict has nothing on Jim Carrey and I can't help but compare and it's light years away from that amazing movie.
54,"If you have watched the grinch before, this movie offers few surprises. There were some additions, like the single mother and the reindeer, that were cute, but they didn't offer any entertainment. The choice to add more of Max, The grinch's dog, was a good one, as it gave the grinch a more ""human"" aspect, showing that there was some potential there for improvement and that he wasn't that bad after all. Actually, the grinch here was more of a loner rather than the bad guy. So, overall, it was just another grinch movie."
55,"Cons:
*Overall weak pop sountrack that will not age well.
*Narrator's voice is out of place for an animated film.
*Grinch's voice was unremarkable
Pros:
*Likeable characters
*Brilliant and colorful atmosphere/environment
*Writers did a solid job of taking a 20 some odd minute TV Xmas special based on a short children's book and converting it to a full length film."
56,I went to this movie today with my 3 and 7 year old kids and we all enjoyed it! This movie is an easy classic that will be in our Christmas movie rotation every year. It's so nice to see a take on the story that sticks pretty close to the original without doing what kids movies do so often these days - create over the top sad and heartbreaking back stories. Visually the movie looks great and the story moved along quickly enough to keep my 3 year olds attention. The characters are adorable and had everyone in the theatre laughing. If you're looking for a good easy going kids movie this one is great for the whole family.
57,"I was one of those who grew up with the 1966 original. I never liked it. I liked the story, but it lacked something. And the 2000 story left me bored and uninterested. Leave it to Illumination to make me fall in love with the Grinch! The bright colors, the sounds of carols (kudos for the use of religious music!!!) and interesting enough, I could feel the warmth of Whoville and the cold of the Grinch's cave on Mount Crumpet. I could smell the Christmas cookies and taste the red velvet Christmas cake. It was a feast for the senses. Six enthusiastic thumbs up from a 50 year old, her 48 year old hubby and her 8 year old son."
58,"If you don't like Illumination movies, or Minion type movies, you probably won't like this version of The Grinch. Personally, I am not a fan of the original TV special, so I was dreading being dragged along to see this with the family, but I really liked it.It's a very modern take on the classic Dr. Seuss story. The plot line is basically the same, but the humor is a little different and it does play more for laughs.Personally, I prefer this one - my kids said they liked it equally with the original Grinch special.Unlike another reviewer who gave this a 1/10 and said Illumination animation was basic, I don't think it is at all. I think it is crisp and modern, and in comparison to the original, much softer and more likeable, but that's just me.I thought Benedict Cumberbatch was a weird choice for the main character's voice, but on seeing the movie, he was perfect of it.Go into this without any pre-judgment, unlike me, and you're sure to be highly entertained for around 90 minutes.I expected it to be terrible, but it will be a future Christmas favorite for our family!"
59,"They did a great job expanding upon the story. It's a beautifully animated movie, and safe for the whole family. I also appreciated the combination of classic Christmas carols, modern music, and orchestral score. This is a new annual Christmas movie for us!"
60,"Illumination just after monney. The original was so perfect well made story. The new one just make me angry. It took several days to just finishing the movie, never thought an animated movie would be that boring. My provided point is just to the artists whose effort made the movie so eye pleasing. I like Benedict Cumberbatch, but here just waste of his talent. May be kids would like the movie!!!"
61,Took my five year old daughter and this movie was amazing. Loved the concept and it was just too adorable. Highly recommend!
62,"I loved the idea of the this movie going in. I am a huge fan of the story how the grinch stole Christmas. So when I first saw the trailer I was not sure if it be as good. As time when on I thought maybe it be good. Then finally one day before Christmas I decided to sit down and watch the movie. What a disappointment the movie was! I felt as if the animated movie took a lot of short cuts like having the grinch feel a Santa sled inside of making it. Cindy Lou was much more of a tomboy in this movie. She didn't really need the two baby brother (I think it was) becuse they didn't really add anything to the story. In this version is looked like the father was out of the picture which was fine. I didn't like that the plot was more about getting Santa then it was able trying to find the good in the grinch even know other didn't like him. The reindeer that was in the movie for a short moment wasn't really needed. I felt like they added a lot of unnecessary characters to this story. They tried to make the story more modern but it lost some of the magical, fun and coolness that whoville had in the first place by doing that. Plus they changed the plot completely from the Jim Carrey version which is well loved. The plot was average for what it come if you didn't compare this to how the grinch stole Christmas movie that come out years before this one. Play the old movie version was live action and was able to create more magical, fun and greatness then this animation could which is kind of sad. Going into this I thought it would have more fun, and magical things then the alive action one would but I was wrong. If you have kids this is a good movie to watch."
63,"The narrator, the Grinch's voice and especially Cindy-Lou's voice are all wrong. The narrator should be deep, cozy and well christmassy , the Grinch should be more ""evil"" and what's up with Cindy-Lou? She should be sweet and soft, not that awful ugh what ever that is. Also the song? They turned in to some kind of hiphop, rnb garabge."
64,"Most of the tradition was lost. Loved the characters and animals but it was so far off. It couldn't even qualify as a Dr. Seuss movie. They didn't even sing The Who song, hoe do you not sing The Who song?! The added songs were weird/hip hop. Not that I have anything against hip hop, it's just didn't belong here. I do give props to the Grinch for being more nice to Max. The characters were sweet but the movie ran way too long. It's better than the Jim scarred version by far. The narrator was way to young, another element that just didn't fit when the original narrator made the movie."
65,"Watched this with my 8 year old son when he was sick from school. He said he really liked it but I noticed he wasn't laughing very often. I think the story is so timeless and characters so rich that just the fact that it's The Grinch is enough to satisfy. But for me, an adult that actually enjoyed Jim Carey's over the top movie, and of course the universally loved magnificent Chuck Jones version, I just thought this was dull. Very few laughs (although certainly some), nothing new visually, no real imagination. The opening was the best part, as The Grinch wakes and dresses in a fun way. But after that, just kinda of cruises along, one pop song after another.The animation however, is truly fabulous. Looks amazing, bright and colorful and beautiful. Max the dog is cute. The snow really crunched and you can feel the cold.It's been said so often that it's hardly worth saying again - but why remake something and not significantly change it, offering something new to the story? How about setting the story after The Grinch steals Christmas instead of retelling exactly the story we've already seen and enjoyed? Just doesn't make sense to me."
66,"This movie was decent and while the kids enjoyed it, the original is still so much better.It was interesting to see a different take on the story of The Grinch and the animation was very well done, but it seemed like the writers had trouble finding out ways to make such a short story into a movie. Most of the jokes are meant for little kids and I don't think adults will find that funny.While this version of The Grinch is not bad and good for kids, I still perfer the original version much more as it I felt it captured the story better and did it all in only a short running time. This is really only worth watching if you have kids that want to see it."
67,I really wanted to like this movie but it really shouldn't exist. The hip-hop reimagining of the theme was I my opinion very good and it seemed to had a solid cast but jokes failed to land and it stretched a simple story out so long it was boring
68,"The Story: Very festive holiday movie. Heartfelt & warm. Definitely bring up the Christmas spirit. However, maybe because I had watched the play & musical of the story. When I watched this movie, it seems flat. Didn't really get me the ""awwwww"" moment.The Animation: Since there are more & more animation movies out there. Compared to others, the animation in this movie is just a so-so to me. Didn't really ""wow"" me."
69,"It's certainly not bad; the film is colourful and well-animated, it has some positive messages, and the cast all do a good job, however it doesn't offer anything new and is quickly forgettable. I can see it amusing young children, but the humour totally relies on basic slapstick and I didn't really find it funny at all. The slapstick sequences are fairly long and come often, and this highlights the fact that this story is a short one that has been stretched-out to feature length (barely as well; the film only lasts 86 minutes). Another problem is that The Grinch's motivations for stealing Christmas don't seem believable, since in this version he's not even hated by the people of Whosville; instead he simply doesn't like the Christmas period. Here lies another problem: The Grinch isn't even 'evil'. Sure, he does some nasty things on his first visit to the town, but overall it comes across more like he's a bit of a grumpy loner than an 'evil grinch' who purposefully makes other people miserable. I think that this representation of the character somewhat takes away from the narrative and principal character arc. Overall though, 'The Grinch' is okay. There are far worse family films out there, and if you want something to pass the time during the Christmas period with young children, it would be a decent choice. 5/10"
70,"I watched this movie less than 24 hours before I wrote this review and, despite a pretty good memory, I've forgotten approximately 90% of this movie.The Grinch isn't all that grouchy. The music isn't all that catchy. And the jokes aren't all that clever. Most of the attempts at comedy come from A) an appropriately timed frown from the Grinch or B) someone being hit by something or C) animals making silly noises. The quirks and playful ingenuity of Who-ville in the original inspires smiles and warmth; totally unlike the mechanic, blandly colored inventions of this version.A) is what works so well in the original, but fails so spectacularly here. The Grinch is never all that mean (except once, in a supermarket) and never really adequately demonstrates his hatred toward Christmas. Instead of the oddly relatable, fuzzy green scrooge of the original, we get a decently sentimental guy who doesn't like people bumping into him.Thematically, the movie never runs ahead with anything of value. Does the Grinch not like Christmas because of consumerism and materialistic obsession? Who knows, its not developed. The unique commentary could've been there, but it wasn't.The only positive I can think of is the animation. I don't like the style they went with, but the craftsmanship is undeniable. The fuzziness of each character is photorealistic.I'd like to plead with the reader to skip this movie. Your kids may have a fun time, but that's because kids see animation and promptly think they're having fun. However, as I may note, the kids in the theater that I attended did not seem to erupt with laughter as much as I expected. Some laughs were had, but there was never a moment of infectious theater energy that other animated movies may have."
71,"There's a lot that's charming, and a lot that's lazy about this update of The Grinch. Unlike Illumination's take on The Lorax, this film at least preserves the book's message and balances the tone. It takes some time to slow down and be dramatic; a nice break from the surge of colors and painfully unfunny slapstick that obviously panders to the younger audience. That being said, I did enjoy the animation. The scene where the Grinch steals Christmas has a lot of fast, creative movement; it was neat to see a modern take on this sequence. However, the Grinch himself is very inconsistent. Cumberbatch's performance was okay, but this character is supposed to be grouchy 24/7. He constantly goes back and forth doing good and bad deeds throughout the film, and it makes the finale much less impactful than the original story's. He's portrayed more as a cynic than a genuine hate-filled creature. I do really like the new take on Cindy Lou Who, though. She's not an overly perfect, big-eyed, blue-eyed angel, she's actually very plucky and rambunctious, yet loving, much more energetic and relatable. Overall, I'm on the fence with The Grinch. It's nothing new and grand, the holiday message resonates fine despite uneven storytelling and corny jokes."
72,"Seemed bizarre to cast Cumberbatch if you are going to make him do a generic American accent? Could of been done by anyone. The film was OK, it looked great but the story was watered down and the grinch himself was way too soft."
73,"The Grinch,Follows the life of the misanthropic, maudlin and malcontented green 'Christmas-'icon that is the Grinch. In an attempt to recreate the acclaimed Christmas film 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas!', 'The Grinch' is a colourfully animated rendition of this family favourite. But does this remake give its predecessor any justice?Pros: the film is visually stunning and certainly engrosses its audiences in the Christmas spirit. The characters were relatable and enjoyable to follow, especially 'Max' who's innocence and loyalty is instantly cherished by audiences.Cons: the plot was seriously underdeveloped and seemed to be lifeless and tedious at points. The moral allegory presented in the film was overly cliché and appeared to be forced as opposed to presenting it in a natural way. The humour throughout the film was also average, making some scenes very boring.Looking around the cinema, most of the children were bored with the film.Overall: 'The Grinch' while lacking in various areas was an adequate watch for a Christmas film, however, was not different nor better than its previous version.Rating: 5.5/10"
74,"I created an account just to leave a review. I was not in the mood to see this because of the other grinch movies - the original and the Jim Carrey one, which I've seen too many times. However my husband and I had a great time with this new version. We loved the relatable mom (I have twins and worked graveshifts), loved that Cindy-Lou was adventureous and not so delicate, the Grinch was less grichy and more cranky which my husband and I loved (just for a bit of variety), and the relationship he has with maxx is so sweet. Plus it was visually amazing. Anyways, it isn't going to win an oscar, but my family loved the ""tweaked"" version."
75,"As a kid, I hated the Grinch. In fact I was terrified of it. So I was obviously hesitant at the idea of seeing the remake. But the movie was excellent, really gave me the Christmas vibes and Mr. Grinch is actually really nicer then he seems. The graphics/drawings (however you wanna call them) are mind blowing ! It's a great movie that shows kids how Christmas is not about receiving gifts, but about spending time with the loved ones.However, I felt like they didn't represent the Grinch's mean side enough before gradually showing his nice side. And the script was a little (a lot) lame and cheesy, but I'm not going to base my review on that.Don't hesitate to watch it with kids, it was very touching:)"
76,Apparently the old farts who rated this film keep a copy of the 1957 Dr Suess adaption under their pillow. They were expecting a combination of the original animated movie along with a masterpiece like The Godfather. Give me a break. Sorry they took an original story and MY GOODNESS they make it a little different?! My word what a travesty.This was one of the best animated films I've ever seen and it has the same moral story as the book. Ignore the grumpy baby boomers who are upset that it doesn't follow the original to a t.
77,"This was the first movie theater experience for my 3 year old son. At 1 hour and 30 minutes he did get a tad restless in the later half of the film, which is to be expected. But he did love the film and the experience.
As for me, nothing will top the classic cartoon from my childhood. And bits of this felt a bit more stretched out than needed be. But overall I found it cute, lighthearted entertainment that managed to capture the spirit of the original. The voice acting and a animation were solid. The songs, while not as good in my 43 year old eyes as the original tunes, were still serviceable."
78,It was so good benedict cumberbatch is awsome in this like always
79,I want to say first off that I love the original 30 minute Christmas special that started it all! It is classic and it is the best. Many critics and people who have bashed the new movie say that the original is the only one needed. They say that this one is too bloated with extra details and additions to the story. From just my recent viewing of the film I have to disagree completely. The new characters and additions to the story made it even better and gave us more insight into why the grinch is so bitter. Overall The Grinch is a heartwarming film that spreads the true message of Christmas while keeping the simplicity of the original and adding thoughtful new characters and backstories to give greater meaning to the story by dr. Seuss. Don't listen to the critics and watch it yourself!!!
80,The Grinch illustrates the emotional depth of the classical Grinch character while adding a humours characterisation. Sad when he dies in the end
81,"Review:
For an animation movie made for kids, I actually enjoyed this film. Maybe I'm going soft! The animation was top class, and the vibrate colours and attention to detail was quite impressive. The director stuck to the original concept, which was a plus, and I must admit, I did get a bit emotional towards the end. Don't get me wrong, it's not in the same league as the old Pixar movies, but there is something for the whole family, especially the little ones. The movie kicks off in the town of Whoville, were the humanoids called Who's are filled with excitement about celebrating Christmas. The only one who isn't amused is a cantankerous, green-furred creature called The Grinch (Benedict Cumberbatch), who has a heart ""two sizes too small"" and lives in a cave on the top of Mount Crumpit just north of Whoville. The Grinch has a pet dog named Max and they both only visit Whoville when the Grinch needs to buy food and do bad things. Meanwhile, 5-year-old Cindy Lou Who notices that her mother Donna is overworked trying to take care of herself and her baby twin brothers, Buster and Bean. At First, she decides to send a letter to Santa Claus to help her mother, but after encountering the Grinch, who sarcastically says that she'll have to talk to Santa face-to-face about it, she then decides to go to the North Pole to talk to Santa, but when Donna tells her that it would take a month to get there and back home, her final decision is to try and trap Santa with the help of her friends. With Christmas approaching, all the Whoville festivities give the Grinch a flashback, recalling his disjointing childhood spent mostly alone and unwanted in an orphanage. The Grinch soon decides that he will steal Christmas from Whoville to assuage his distress. He acquires a fat reindeer whom he calls Fred to help him pull a sleigh that he stole from his neighbour, Mr. Bricklebaum. After a test run, the Grinch discovers that Fred has a family. With a heavy heart, he lets Fred go home with them. On Christmas Eve, after making a Santa Claus disguise and dozens of gadgets to help him with his plan, the Grinch and Max, who pulls the sleigh in Fred's place, go down to Whoville to steal the decorations and presents. He soon encounters Cindy after falling into her trap. Her request to help lighten her mother's workload, and her kind advice about listening to the Who's singing to alleviate his sadness, touches the Grinch's bitter heart, but he still carried on with his mission. After stealing every Christmas present, the Who's wake up and are shocked to see that the presents and decorations are gone. At first, Cindy believes that she's to blame because she trapped Santa, but Donna tells her that Christmas is more than just about presents and that Cindy's the best thing that ever happened to her. The Who's then join together and sing, which puzzles the Grinch because they are still celebrating Christmas, despite the theft. After heeding Cindy's advice and immersing himself to their singing, his small bitter heart grows up three times it's original size. The Grinch and Max decide to return to Whoville to return the stolen items. A guilt-ridden and remorseful Grinch admits his crimes to the Who's, and apologises before returning to his cave. Feeling sorry for the Grinch, Cindy Lou comes to invite him to celebrate Christmas at her house, and he awkwardly attends. When seated down for dinner, he realises and confesses that it wasn't really Christmas he despised, but being alone and his bitterness over being neglected. Before carving the roast beast, the Grinch affects a toast ""To kindness and love, the things we need most. What a sweet story! Personally, I can't see myself watching it more than once, but I still enjoyed this adaptation of an old classic. Although he was a grumpy so and so, I liked the relationship between the Grinch and his trustee companion Max, who was always there for him. I did think that the soundtrack didn't suit the film, and the narrating got on my nerves after a while but judging by the box office takings, and the decent reviews, it's still worth a watch. Watchable!Round-Up:
This is the first major release for director Scott Mosier, who did a decent job with this project, even though it has been made a few times before. It was also directed by Yarrow Cheney, who was co-director for the Secret Life of Pets, The Very First Noel and the Minions short, Puppy!. After watching the bonus material, It's amazing to see the amount of work that goes on behind the scenes in the animation world, which is why it takes so long to release movies in this genre. Every hair, colour and facial expression is finely detailed, which goes through many processes before it's final render, so I appreciate the work that went into making this film. With that aside, I do think that the humour could have been much better, and I would have liked to have seen some more depth from the various characters but it's still fun for the whole family.Budget: $75million

82,"This third screen adaptation of Dr. Seuss's 1957 children book 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas!' was not good. Don't get me wrong, the 2018's computer-animation movie produced by Illumination Entertainment & released by Universal Pictures was not a holiday stinker. However, it was indeed, a huge disappointment. It doesn't have the unique, risky, yet funny entertaining humor of the 2000 live-action film version nor the charm of the original 1966 hand drawn animation television special. It was just adequate and that's really sad. Most of the blame, can be said with how they portray the reclusive, Mr. Grinch (Voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) who decides to ruin Christmas for the cheery citizens of Whoville by stealing all their gifts and everything holiday related. He really not that mean. He should had been a heel that should had been cuddly as a cactus. A being that charming as an eel. Yet, throughout the movie, he really is not that bad to be around. Even before, Christmas even came, he already had a heavy heart to certain key characters. He doesn't exploit or mistreat them, much at all. That's a problem, because the Grinch is supposed a bad banana, with a greasy black peel who heart is 'two sizes too small', but he's not! Even his reasons for hating the holiday is kinda muddled. I get that, Christmas, kinda remind him, about how alone and unwanted, he thinks, he really is, but the Who People don't really treat him, that way to justified that type of thinking. Throughout the film, people like Bricklebaum (Voiced by Kenan Thompson), who by far, is the best character in the flick, really go out of their way to befriend him. There's nothing to suggest the Grinch is ostracized by the Who People. Now, if the film make the citizen of Whoville look like selfish materialism consumer bullies like the 2000 film version did. It gives a good reason why the Grinch would think of stealing gifts is fine idea to stop Christmas. Even the original 1966 film, gave an understandable motive for him, trying to steal their gifts, as he couldn't stand, all the noise. He found their loud hedonism nature to be annoying. People can related to that. In this film, only the out of blue carolers are highly obnoxious with their over-stalking forcing of religionist beliefs type singing. Everybody else is just normal and fine. While, this movie hints that he might suffer from some type of social anxiety. It never states, outright if he does has it. Because of this lack of depth, the character motive might seem confusing, and very lost. Another problem with the Grinch is the voice. Benedict's American accent voice has no weight. It's sound a little bland. It didn't seem powerful or sinister at all. The tone had no kick. What happened, here!? Was the Smaug or Khan's voice, too dark to use in a kid's movie!? I doubt it. After all, they got Frankenstein Monster, himself, Boris Karloff to voice the titular character & the narrator in the original version. Look, I get that the film will never outdo the original film, but gees, the 2018's remake directed by Scott Mosier played it, way too safe with the Grinch. Even the narrator felt out of place. Pharrell Williams was not a good choice. Not only did he never did any kind of voice acting, before this. He didn't really, have that seniority traditional storytelling depth & tone, need for this piece in the first place. It felt like he was nervously, reading off, a script, as quick as possible rather than helping, expanding the depth of this world like Sir Anthony Hopkins did in the 2000 film. Also, it was somewhat irritating that the writers didn't keep focus on the original story poem-like rhythm for most of the sequence, he was speaking. Things get more frustrating when the movie try to update the original song 'You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch' by music performer, Thurl Ravenscroft with one from hip hop artist, Tyler the Creator, whom been criticized in the past for his use of homophobic slurs, racial stereotypes, his graphic depictions of violence against women and his allegedly misogynistic lyrics. While, his version was indeed catchy, it still feels dirty to listen to. I can see people, easily getting turn off by it, due to the negatively surrounding his personal life. It will only have niches amount of listeners. It will quickly seem passes. It will never hold the same candle to the Ravenscroft's version; which spiritual transcendence all time. As for the upbeat jazzy version of this song by Bob Malone. I see this one, having more of a shelf life. It's a lot more fun to listen to. As for the humor, in the film. The jokes were not that funny. Nothing really did landed for me. The movie also has pacing problem. Lots of pointless filler scenes that run the time, a little too long like the reindeer hunting sequence & the b plot of Cindy Lou (Voiced by Cameron Seely) trying to capture Santa Claus. None of them, were that compelling nor matter much. At least, the animation was good. It maintaining a colorful and festive atmosphere. Overall: I just wish, the story stood out more. It felt formula, generic & worst of all, recycled. There were too many similar to 2010's film 'Despicable Me' for me to like. If one of your characters sounds & acts like too much like Agnes from 2010's film 'Despicable Me', then you got a problem. In the end, while, I wouldn't say, don't touch this with a 39 ½ foot pole. Given the choice between watching this, again and watching a movie about a seasick crocodile. I'd take the seasick crocodile! At least, I know that film will have some bite to it. Sadly, for me, this will be one time watch."
83,"Sadly it didn't hit the spots is how'd for on any level.
Brightly coloured dvd very detailed animation moves across large spaces far too quickly and far too often, causing a sense of motion sickness as you try to follow the blur.
What the Grinch desperately needs is comedy. This struggled to find it. The obese reindeer had potential, but became a tag along character with little input. Max the dog is likeable, but only scratched the surface of what could have been a great opportunity to create laughter.
Benedict Cumberbatch is great, normally... but with a weak script and that American accent, it's definitely not drawing the best from him."
84,There were cute scenes but they were all in the trailer. The whole family was disappointed by this movie.
85,As being a GRINCH specialist ... I have loved it from the start ... THIS REMAKE drags on and on and on and on and on and on! Not like the original that keeps you engaged.There was a some funny parts but half the time I found my mind drifting. I am open to give remakes a chace but THIS MISSED THE MARK BIG TIME!
86,It was like watching the Grinch without a Grinch. The voice wasn't Grinchie enough and the the narrator voice was to young. The story was a semi retake and didn't flow. Worked for children that didn't know what the Grinch was all about
87,"This is NOT an improvement on the 26 minute, 1966, made for TV, Classic HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS. It's not as bad as the 2000 live action version, but it begs the question, ""Why mess with success?"" As a stand alone, animated, seasonal movie, it has some good points: the animation is good (the young Grinch is absolutely adorable and will probably sell a lot of merchandise - which may be the point of making this remake), it has some entertaining and diverse additional characters and it has an additional umbrella morale about the sacrifice of mothers and value of family. However, Benedict Cumberbatch is wasted in this movie (indeed any nasal toned American actor would have done as well), Pharrell Williams offers up some lame rhyming narration that doesn't come close to the excellence of Dr. Suess' craft. Cindy Lou Who is aged about 5 years and loses the innocent charm of the original. Under the stand alone criteria, I might give it a 6 (fair) out of 10 {Holiday Animation}, but, as an updated version of the original work, I give it a 5 (unnecessary remake) out of 10. {Christmas Classic}."
88,Had a modern twist and Benedict Cumberbatch is the best😍😍😍 loves the old ones but this was my favorite version so far loveddd it!!
89,"The Grinch Is A Great Christmas Animated Movie For All Ages!Warm,Lovely and I Recommend It"
90,Brilliant Christmas movie ! I can see is watching it every Xmas season for many years to come
91,"Completely, 100% miscast. Every single character is miscast in this bland retelling of Dr. Seuss's classic.Benedict Cumberbatch's American accent is deep, inconsistent and weird.Rashida Jones has no business lending her voice to any animated feature. Bland and monotone, she's not exactly known for being an over the top, fun character actor. Why her of all actresses?Kenan Thompson....is Kenan Thompson. Offers nothing interesting or fantastical in the world of Whoville. He just sounds like he's phoning in another SNL character.Pharrel Williams was a last minute addition as narrator - and it shows. He sleeps his way through this...I think if you listen closely you may even hear him yawn.The animation is colourful, yet feels stiff. They've smoothed over Dr. Seuss's classic illustration style, leaving the Who's of Whoville unrecognizable as Suess characters. Is the Grinch still the Grinch without his iconic grimace? Nope. Now he's just a cuddly, green Q-Tip that no one asked for."
92,"Plot: It's the same story as it was 61 years ago. The Grinch is stealing Christmas of course! He's bitter and hates all the bright lights, trees and Roast Beast! But then, there's a new sub plot that's happening. Cindy-Lou Who (is that how you spell it? I don't care) is a sweet angle that has never harmed a single soul. She see's her mother, overworked, and has a brilliant stroke of genius. She will stay up late, capture Santa, and ask her to help her mom. Because . . . well . . . Santa does that . . sure . . . yeah. Overall this subplot is boring and really is only their for the Grinch to fell bad about stealing Christmas. The main story at some points is as slow as a turtle but at other times is as fast as the babysitters boyfriend when the parents come home (yes, I stole that joke from MatPat, what are you going to do?).Animation: It's bright and colorful and very fun. Except when making the Grinch look fluffy and cuddly as a Teddy Bear. Yeah, that was a bad choice, the Grinch is lean and mean not . . . what ever this Teddy Bear is . . .Max is fun and more visually interesting which is a plus. So yeah good stuffSoundtrack: It's bad It's bad It's bad It's bad It's bad It's bad It's bad It's bad It's bad. The remixed Grinch theme is especially embarrassing for anyone involved and has made my ears bleed all over the movie theater floorFinal thoughts: This movie is bright and colorful and will be a wonderful distraction for a younger audiences. But this movie is very unnecessary and really shouldn't really exist. The Grinch himself has lost most of his Grinchy-ness and just seems like a not very mean or bitter person. My favorite line of the movie was ""He didn't steal Christmas, he just stole stuff."" SCRIPT LEVEL 100! We've already heard the classic Grinch story. Reading the books, watching the old TV special or watching Jim Carrey desperately flounder across the screen trying to convince people that he as an actual actor. This movie has it's good moments and nicely animated, but easily forgettable and unnecessary in every way, shape, and form"
93,The Grinch(2018) is a fantastic family holiday film. It is a must see for the holiday season
94,"Dull, flat and illumination - that's a wrap!Let's start with the most important character - the Grinch! Benedict Cumberbatch voices the iconic fellow and you would think he would do a good job, given his vocal range. WRONG! It isn't mean enough, nor is it emotional enough. It's flat flat flat. If Grinch was a 37 year old nerd, living with his mother and upset with the fact his new computer hardware keeps crashing, then this voice is perfect. But it isn't sinister enough. An angry Ned Flanders (The Simpsons) would be more intimidating.Let's move on to the other characters. They are also flat. There is no character development with anyone and they all seem like mindless 2d characters. No ""whoville"" character traits, no vocal emotional range again and they even look boring. And they all have beards!!! why! It's like Hipsterville.Cindy - Lou and the Grinch ...WHERE WAS THE CONNECTION! They had 2 meetings and they pass you by as meaningless. Forgetabble. Then at the end The Grinch says ""your daughter changed my life"" really?! by saying one thing.Summery - Just watch Jim Carey's Grinch and compare the two and you'll see the difference. In fact, just watch the trailers and they tell you enough.This new Grinch does not move you, not even an inch. It's unflavoured popcorn with no salt, not even a pinch. The Grinch is too nice, some say an Atticus Finch, just watching the trailer will make you wince wince wince."
95,"Okay, so I actually wanted to see this and I was excited but...if you've seen any grinch movie or you know the story you know how this begins and ends. I do like how they gave Max more characteristics of an actual dog. That's one reason I'm giving it 5. Another reason is because they made the Grinch more relatable and actually showed him having more emotions other than the classic ""Grinch Grumpiness."" All in all of you want a different view of the Grinch and/or a family Christmas movie, go watch it."
96,"Before I saw this movie I read a lot of negative things about this movie, and reading all of it made me a little nervous to see this cause I mainly didn't want to waist my time, but walking out theater I was surprised at how great it was. The movie is animated beautifully and has a fantastic moral and story about how Christmas can't be stolen because it's always with us (as a reference to Jesus Christ being born in Christmas). I think this is one of the best movies of this year (which isn't saying much) but it's still great and everybody needs to see this."
97,The grumpy Grinch learns about what the real meaning of Christmas is with the help of a little Who from Whoville. This movie is not only safe for the whole family but this whimsical adaption feels very Seussical. The movie feels pointed towards younger children but I was very engaged and would recommend it to adults as well. I loved the style of animation! I loved the choices for the voice actors! I hope that this becomes a holiday classic! Check out our discussion guide and review at DownTheHobbitHoleBlog.
98,Okay so I have no idea where all the bad reviews are coming from I went to see it and I thought it was marvolus it was hilarious and warm hearted it's so beautiful and I recommend it to anyone
99,Ok I get this movie isn't getting very good reviews and I for one don't get why I personally loved it I laughed out loud and felt joy In my heart this is a movie I'm so happy I payed money to go see the heart was there it really made me ready for Christmas and the spirit was there I totally recommend you go see it
100,"On point animation with full on Christmas treatment, my son and I loved it and it really put us in the festive mood."
101,Love it the grinch it was a good and great movie even though it boring it stills bring us heartwarming
102,"What Illumination does with the source material is to bring this to an entirely new level; the depth of the animation is fantastic and detailed, and the story itself is funny and relevant. The casting is spot on, the Danny Elfman score is inspired, and the song selection is nearly perfect. I say nearly, as the new version of ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"", by Tyler the Creator, is a mumbled mess. There's no beating the classic version, sung by Thurl Ravenscroft, But what Tyler the (okay, I'm seriously not writing out that ludicrous name again) does to the annunciation of the lyrics is borderline inane. Pairing him with children is creepy and just plain weird. At least it is only a brief cut, and we aren't subjected to a full version of the song.
The highpoints are Pharrell Williams' narration, Cameron Seeley as Cindy Lou Who, and (most of the time) Cumberbatch's Grinch. Easily the best animated film of the year."
103,Okay so I loved the movie and it made me laugh and feel very warn inside it had a ton of humor heart and loads of good lessons for young and old alike it made me feel all Christmas like so I hope it'll do the same for you and yours
104,"This movie is wonderful. It truely makes you get into the christmas spirit. The cast in this movie was great, especially Benedict Cumberbatch. He really put alot alot of power and character into the Grinch. Even better than Jim Carreys Grinch imo. The grich is a pretty lonely character so he has max to get along with. Max is a great character, though a dog, he's still loveable. The chemistry between Max and Grinch works great. In my opinion they could have given Frank a better exit than the way they did. I felt like the process of the Grinch becoming Santa was pushed a little late in the film, and that they spent too much time showing grinch just wondering around. There wasn't a whole lot going on with the story/plot. It was kinda just the same as the previous live action film with Jim Carrey, but the new characters kind of helped with that. Also what made it a little better was that they gave Cindy-Lou a motive for being in the movie, which was her just trying to help her mom. I was expecting to get some kind of cameo from past illumination characters, but i did like the callbacks to the previous grinch film. I feel like thus movie will only be popular for the next couple days. I dont really plan on seeing this again. Its not amazing but still a fun watch. Great movie for the kids."
105,"Maybe children will enjoy this film? But honesty I feel that aside from the beautiful animation there is nothing else to keep any audience member engaged. It's way too long. The voice and demeanor of the Grinch is all wrong. The story rambles in different directions. The hip hop music intervals are a mismatch. And the narration is flat. It plugs in elements of the original Dr Seuss rhyming story but loses ALL of the fluid poetry, meaning and charm!"
106,I don't think even as a kid I would have enjoyed this. The Grinch just wasn't ...the grinch! Stick to the Jim version it's far better.
107,"I am not even disappointed by this movie, it was exactly what I expected from an Illumination creation. Basically everything in this movie is inferior to other movies about the Grinch. The movie added nothing of interest to the story or the characters, and it didn't really draw advantage of the new possibilities presented by animation either. Basically every interesting scene was spoiled by the trailers, and I only ever laughed once. The characters are bland, the animation is bland, the comedy is bland, this is just a very average Illumination movie, which means it's pretty bad."
108,"Only two major mistaked: They should have gotten Morgan Freeman to narrate this film, not Pharrell Williams. And dear God, The Grinch rap remix is horrendous! Like they were going for Jay-Z and hard knock life. Bad decisions were made. But other than that, the movie isn't that bad and enjoyable for children. Lord knows my kid loves it."
109,"The Grinch has already had a cartoon and a live action adapation with Jim Carrey. This movie has some heartwarming moments, but they feel too kid friendly, I was a bit disappointed by this knowing how funny and emotional the Jim Carrey version was, this one lacks those features, the Grinch is a lot nicer in this movie which kinda ruins the purpose. I did laugh at a couple scenes but not as many as in the Jim Carrey version. The animation was also pretty good atleast, so it isn't good or bad, it's just meh."
110,"Ruined the ""you're a mean one mr grinch"" song. And Cumberbatch should've done his Famous Alan Rickman impersonation For the Grinch, and /or the narration, to come even close to the wonderful affect of Boris Karloff's narration in the original. And I don't remember them actually singing Christmas carols in the original. They sang Suessesque holiday sounding songs. The whole point of the original was to cause you to take a fresh look at winter celebrations and their meaning-the spirit of Christmas and Hanukkah and all the winter gift giving traditions."
111,"Not terrible, but probably hurt by the fact that I had seen a bunch of Boris Karloff movies just prior to this, which made his absence in this telling of the tale that more noticeable."
112,"I didn't come into this with expectations or anything, I often don't considering how poorly made much of Illuminations slock is. So i'm ""proud"" to say The Grinch isn't Illumination's worst, just a thoughtless and joyless product that completely misses the point of the original short.First things first, Cumberbatch does not fit this role whatsoever. I did think he'd be great to voice the Grinch, but he's terrible in this movie. His voice doesn't match the character whatsoever and does nothing to bring the character more to life. Before my watch of the 2018 film I watched the 1960s one and Jim Carrey's and I can just see how much energy and emotion Jim put into his performance, whereas Cumberbatch sounds like he's depressed and reading his lines into a microphone on his bed, in his pajamas. The Grinch himself is written in a way that pulls all punches and has to cave in to cutesy kids logic instead of a clever way that tells a good story. Instead of making The Grinch actually funny or interesting, they make him a grumpy hipster who woke up on the wrong side of the bed; A good guy at heart but just needs his morning coffee. The entire movie I could just feel the directors just wanting him to be cruel and mean but also a good guy at heart y'know? Because all mean characters can't possibly be mean anymore, they gotta also be good too... y'know?It's boring, uninspired, and vanilla film that I don't recommend to anyone looking for an interesting movie. Much like the character, the movie sucks out anything interesting in favor for playing it safe and selling toys. The music is even done by rapper Tyler The Creator, who is a pretty good artist for the most part. However the music here is terribly uninspired and obviously an attempt to make the film more hip. Most of the jokes are entirely predictable. Actually, the entire movie is predictable. I don't mean we've seen the original movies, I mean the film follows every generic story you'll ever see in a kids movie. The film feels more like it was written by a computer and less like a team of engrossed screenwriters. One of the film's running gags is the ex-popular 'screaming goat' meme...seriously, I thought that meme stopped being funny in 2013.Truthfully, this film is not the worst thing to come out of Illumination. It may not be a good movie, but at least it doesn't completely mis-educate its message like The Lorax did, and at least it isn't as excruciatingly for-the-masses as Minions or The Secret Life Of Pets. When are we as an audience going to stop letting these thoughtless movies slide solely because of their cuteness? They've been milking the Minions for years now and everyone seems ok with it even though it's a Rabbid's clone that's just more successful than its predecessor. Regardless, moms and kids alike will continue to enjoy these movies without the slightest care, simply because it's cute and nothing more."
113,"I was so looking forward to watching this with my kids. Once we finally did, I was happy we waited for Netflix. There were some cute/funny parts and the characters were adorable, but that's it. Like others have said, Grinch was too soft."
114,"I could probably detail my thoughts on the details of this movie, but by the time I post this review, I'll probably forget what happened."
115,I absolutely love how the grinch stole Christmas (with Jim Carey) and it's to this day my all time favorite Christmas movie (other than a Christmas story) but this.... this was just disappointing. I won't lie and say I didn't like the remixes they did to the music because I did. They were catchy and made me wanna groove a bit. But that's about all. The movie lost its meaning and It didn't make me feel like Christmas even tho its July (but HTGSC gets me in the Christmas mood any month <.<) anywayssssssss nobody asked for this and It definitely could've stayed where It was. My three year old nephew didn't enjoy this either. He was bored and only liked the music.
116,"I watched this with my grandson. Yes, I still think the original cartoon based on the book is superior. There is a simplicity that really works. The Grinch is downright mean. I love Benedict Cumberbach, but found his voice just too soothing to pull off our guy. There was too much psychological mumbo jumbo as the writers came up with an excuse for the Grinch being the way he was. Of course, it was his childhood. The movie is spectacular in its visuals. There are colorful scenes and excellent structures, making Whoville really magnificent. But the story is watered down and using Cindy Lou Who as an active character didn't work for me."
117,The narrator sounded like it was his first time narrating anything. Couldnt get into it. Didnt enjoy the grinches voice nor cindy lou. Just didnt suit them. Maybe it was the wishy washy story. As creepy as the jim carrey one was it was more engaging than this. Nice to look at though
118,"Was this terrible? No. The worst sin of this movie is that it's boring. Essentially, this movie took the original 30 minute cartoon, updated the animation, and stretched it out to fill a 90 minute run time. Except, they didn't write any new material to pad that runtime.The Grinch has a smidge of a backstory that involves him being an orphan, Cindy-Lou Who has an overworked single mom, and The Grinch originally found a fat reindeer named Frank to pull his sleigh, but that didn't pan out because Frank had a family. That's all the new material.It could have been good if they had taken the time to write more new material and flesh out the story more to fit the runtime, similarly to how the Jim Carrey movie did.I think little kids would find this movie enjoyable. I mean, it's nice to look at. There is a plot in there. Benedict Cumberbatch does a decent job voicing The Grinch.Would I recommend it? No, I would recommend the original cartoon because it still holds up, and it's an hour shorter."
119,After heating theating terrible reviews of this movie I wasn't sure what to think going to see it but boy am I ever glad I did I haven't laughed at a family comedy so hard this year and I was surprised that the level of heart was so high it was a very sweet joyful film for young and old alike the movie was something I wouldn't recommend missing it was brilliant
120,"When you can laugh til you cry at a movie, plus review a good, heartfelt message for all ages...THAT is a winner! I'm also a tough critic so I'm truly amazed! Whipped me right into the Christmas spirit! 😍👏🏼🎥🍿"
121,"If there was one animated movie this year that I really didn't have high hopes for, it was ""The Grinch"" and there's a good reason why. With the exception of Blue Sky Studios ""Horton Hears A Who!"", every Dr. Seuss movie I have seen has been not good. I didn't like Jim Carrey's take on the Grinch, I thought ""The Lorax"" was a mess, and the less said about Mike Myers' ""Cat in the Hat"", the better. So when Illumination announced they were gonna do another take on How the Grinch Stole Christmas, I got really nervous. Not only was their last Dr. Seuss movie was ""The Lorax"" which like I said was a mess, but the advertising for ""The Grinch"" didn't look very appealing to me. So, you can imagine my surprise when I found out that I actually did enjoy this movie. Yeah, I'm not joking here. ""The Grinch"" is actually a legitimate good Dr. Seuss movie which I never thought I'd see myself utter. Granted it may not be as good as the Chuck Jones television special which I still find a masterpiece, but still I think this film does the classic story justice.While the Who's down in Whoville prepare their annual Christmas celebration, the Grinch (Benedict Cumberbatch) is dreading it's arrival due to his unpleasant experiences he has of it. As the celebration plans to get bigger and bigger, the Grinch then plans to steal the holiday from Whoville by dressing as Santa Claus and taking everything Christmas away with the help of his loyal dog Max. The rest of the film does involve him planning on enacting his plan as well as subplot involving the young Cindy Lou Who (Cameron Seely), but I'm not gonna spoil it here since the advertising didn't do it also.To be honest, I really was expecting to hate this film going in. I didn't think this film was necessary considering we had the Chuck Jones special and I still had bad memories of ""The Lorax"" as well as Illumination's other mediocre movies like ""Minions"" and ""Despicable Me 3"" so I really was surprised to see how faithful the story was the original book. It does capture the original story and it's message perfectly and seeing the Grinch prepare his plot to take the holiday led to some funny moments, but it was the subplot with Cindy Lou Who was pretty much the icing of the cake of the film. I really loved this subplot of the movie because it actually legitimately felt heartwarming and I felt that the writing in the scenes with Cindy Lou and her friends was pretty spot on for young kids. The animation once again is good for an Illumination movie. One thing I was legitimately happy with seeing for this film was that they hired new character designers to work on the movie. I did voice my frustration with having Eric Guillon do the character designers for all of Illumination's previous animated movies as it was pretty unfair for other artists out there, so seeing some new artists work on the film was quite relieving to see. As for the characters, they did have their moments. I do like the new take on the Grinch in this movie and I'll give credit to Cumberbatch and Illumination for doing a new take on the character and not base it off Boris Karloff or Jim Carrey's performances as he does act like the famous Christmas grump we all know and even does have some fun moments with Max. Though it's really Cindy Lou that steals the show for me. She was fantastic due to her determined passion and fun personality and her voice actress Cameron Seely was really good in this movie. I can see a bright future ahead for her and I'm really excited to see what she does next. Even her friends are also a lot of fun and led to some funny moments. Though I did really like Seely's performance in the film, I will say Cumberbatch's voice for the Grinch was really questionable. Rather than doing his regular British accent, Cumberbatch played the character with an American accent and ended up sounding a little odd. In fact, if you didn't tell me that was Cumberbatch I would've assumed that Bill Hader was voicing the Christmas grump. He really sounded like Bill Hader playing this character which made me think if that was the route Illumination was going with then I don't understand why they didn't get Bill Hader to play him. Also, I've got to ask why was Pharell Williams chosen as the narrator? I get that he commonly works with Illumination, but I find it very odd for him to be narrating the film and not even do songs for it. I'll also say some of the jokes do fall flat as well. Like ""Smallfoot"", this film does have another screaming goat joke which I really think is old and tired now. Though luckily there were other funny jokes that made up for it.And you know what, I think ""The Grinch"" gave me what I wanted to see for a Dr. Seuss movie. It gave me a story that was faithful to the original without getting annoying or insulting, animation that was bright and colorful that would go well with the book, and characters that had fun and charm although some of their voice over work did come off questionable at times. I still am up for debate to decide if this movie is better than Horton or not, but in the end I still think it's a good Dr. Seuss movie and I'll take that any day over a bad one."
122,"Cheer up: ""The Grinch"" is a respectable, if safe, retelling of Dr. Seuss' holiday classic.This computer animated fable - which follows the televised 1966 cartoon special and 2000's Jim Carrey-starring live action version - honors the original ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"" and preserves Seuss' wonky visual style.If this Grinch is considerably cuddlier than the green monster you remember - his edges are rounded rather than sharp, his eyes soft rather than twisted and menacing - that's just the reality of today's marketplace. Can you imagine the uproar if the Grinch was an actual, you know, Grinch?Benedict Cumberbatch ditches his accent to voice the Christmas-hating heel, who lives in a cave by himself high above Whoville. Cumberbatch's reading is rather sanitized; if directors Yarrow Cheney and Scott Mosier didn't want a British Grinch, Cumberbatch was a curious choice.The holiday season is fast approaching, and ol' Grinchy is forced to go into Whoville and interact with its cheery inhabitants, who are preparing for a Christmas celebration that promises to be three times larger than the average holiday blowout. The Grinch - aided by his trusty dog Max - devises a scheme to rob the residents of Whoville of all their Christmas bounty while dressed as Santa Claus, until his plan is foiled by young Cindy Lou Who (voiced by Cameron Seely), who puts a little love back in the Grinch's rotten, decrepit heart.You know the story, and ""The Grinch"" wisely sticks to the basics without modernizing the details (the Grinch doesn't suddenly have an Instagram account) or greatly altering the structure. The 2000 version spent a good deal of time diving into the Grinch's backstory, making him a victim of childhood bullying; that's gone here. And since the original book runs just 69 pages, ""The Grinch"" doesn't stretch for material, and wraps in a concise 86 minutes.Pharrell Williams narrates the story, but doesn't have much flavor in his phrasing; somewhere, there's a voice actor cursing the day celebrities took over the voiceover field.Illumination Entertainment, responsible for the ""Despicable Me"" movies and ""The Secret Life of Pets,"" is in charge here, and gives the film a brightly lit, visually appealing aesthetic.""The Grinch"" doesn't reinvent the story of the Grinch, nor does it top the crudely drawn charms of the original TV version. (It's tough to beat Boris Karloff's Grinch, and Cumberbatch doesn't put up much of a fight.) But by the end it opens it arms and spreads a fair amount of holiday cheer, which is obvious to even those whose hearts are two sizes too small."
123,"I watched this movie at the cenima , it was funny movie ,i think this movie is suitable for kid ..also it's family movie ..i laughed a lot..in my opinion i think this movie deserve high rate .. my rate is (10\10)"
124,Ok so going to see this movie i wasnt sure what to think yet after all the negative reviews but boy am i glad i did it may have been short on length but it was big on what mattes most the heart of the movie plus the added humor helped out too
125,"We took our kids (age 5 & 7) to see it and had pretty low expectations after reading reviews. It was great. I'm always amazed at how far animation has come over the years - very interesting visually. Frequent laughter, good story line, an absolutely adorable Cindy Lou, and a few new additions and characters. Well done. Good way to kick off the Christmas spirit."
126,The Grinch's meanness and terrible deeds is met with love and forgiveness from the town - because he truly felt awful for the things he did. This movie is about grace; unmerited favor. I loved it and I am proud of Disney for producing a film like this. Enjoy this movie with your family!
127,"The Grinch is good, clean, wholesome, honest, family fun. We took three generations to the movie (grandparents, parents, grandchild) and everyone enjoyed this.This version of The Grinch far out shadows the Jim Carrey version. Benedict Cumberbatch brings a sour, grinchy, but somehow loveable Mr. Grinch to this adaptation of the classic Seuss story. Keeping fairly close to the source material, but still taking some fun creative license, this movie encapsulates Dr. Seuss's original meaning behind the tale.Those who give this movie a poor rating, citing that the movie is too clean and wholesome, clearly don't have children. Dare I say that those reviewers may be grinches themselves, clearly not understanding the meaning of Christmas as Dr. Seuss himself would have us understand it."
128,"Just took my seven year old daughter to see it. I was wondering how they were going to turn it into a longer feature. The story lines and characters they added worked for us (I did laugh out loud at quite a few of their on-screen moments). I also appreciated the way they softened the Grinch up a bit (visually and emotionally) - still snarky/grinchy but less intense - and made him a part of the community so he was less of a 'shock' when he showed up in town. Maybe at times it seemed 'stretchy', but I was never bored or hoping it would move along faster. My husband couldn't come with us and my daughter already said she'd like to take him to see it. If she liked it and I was amused, it's a winner in our book. An adaptation that worked for us."
129,Okay due to reviews I wasn't sure about this one but as I watched I would up being ever so happy I went I laughed out loud several times I smiled I felt like I had really seen the perfect movie for Christmas so so good
130,This is an immediate festive classic. Benedict Cumberbatch puts in a faultless performance.I really don't understand the negative reviews. This finally lays the Jim Carrey abomination to rest.Everyone in the cinema was laughing from the start with the sure touch of the studio famous for hits like Despicable Me and Minions providing a raft of visual and verbal gags.I want to spend Christmas in this Whoville and anyone who doesn't isn't welcome at my house this Christmas!
131,"We just saw this in the theater and we loved it. My kids are 3 and 5 and they sat and watched the whole time. As a parent, I loved the story. The world needs a little kindness and love. I"
132,Walking into the theater I wasn't sure what this would be like what was instore well that old Grinch he warmed my heart and I got loads of laughs that's not the best part this movie is moving no doubt about that your family will love it and thata nothing flat between laughing and learning this movie is great this movie might even be good for a date but one thing for sure about that old Grinch you will love it yes love every inch
133,"I absolutely loved this movie and can't understand why it's getting so bashed. I find the two older movies really unsettling, and sometimes find Dr Seuss films a bit too odd, but I think they've got this one perfect! The grinch is a really likeable character as well as his dog, (and cindy lou isn't annoying af). The animators have done so well making even the small actions of the characters hilarious. Ignore the bad reviews.
A must-see!"
134,Not sure why all the negativity as my wife and I thought this movie was adorable. It was both funny and heartwarming.
135,"With all the Christmas haters and Christophobes all over the Earth, this is the movie best for family and kids, to tell the true spirit of Christmas, the wonderful of love and joy, a great culture that we must preserved."
136,"I liked the message and agree, it was rather long. Didn't realize it was a different story line but like I said, it was cute and the animations were great. Can't top the original though, there's no comparison. Overall, I give it two thumbs up."
137,"After watching the worst animation I have ever seen in the cinema. I had to wash it down by watching Jim Carey version immediately after getting home. Went to the cinema with my four year old, she got so bored she slept half way through.
Grinch (Cumberbatch) had no persona to carry a movie by himself in this one. All the characters around had no story line. Nothing was memorable, Christmas is dead to me now thanks to this sham of a movie and 2 months early too. Most nauseating christmas film ever seen in November or even christmas itself."
138,"Since The Grinch with Jim Carry is so fantastic, it's hard to create antoher adaption thats even close as good as the Jim Carrey version. The grinch was to nice and he have seem to lost his ""Grinch-essens"" in this adaption. I didn't recognize him, so maybe someone stole the Grinch instead of the christmas?
Taylor, the creator lifts up the movie with his soundtrack but I wanted to hear more of his music in the movie.
The movie was entertaining, and the ending was nice and warming, but the movie was overall nothing special."
139,"In the light of a new Christmas season, here comes a slew of holiday specials for a reason. Many stories like A Christmas Carol, The Polar Express and The Nutcracker come to mind, How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a magnificent, glorious find. It's no wonder why the Dr. Seuss classic is told over and over again. It's message about commercialism and warm feelings roll around every year like a train. As a book and holiday special, it's become a classic fable. As others have tried to tackle it (like the Ron Howard live action adaptation), it's been slapped with an odd label.I'll admit that I find the Jim Carrey version a guilty pleasure. His over-the-top performance and ability to act in the suit makes Christmas a leisure. While the make-up and design are weird, the movie is something I still find revered. In the past years, we've gotten a new line of animated Dr. Seuss movies. The problem is that what we get is a mixed looney. When I heard the Christmas classic was getting an animated remake, I was curious. Upon viewing The Grinch, there is a lot of good and bad that's various.All the whos in Whoville liked Christmas a lot, but the Grinch (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), who lived just north of Whoville, did not. The Grinch spends his days sulking at the whos for their overly cheerful attitude towards Christmas. Except with his loyal dog Max, everything seems to be going along as business. A trip down into town reminds him why he sulks at the songs and decoration; it constantly pounds his head in Holiday madness and carnation. One who-child who seems to have more worries is little Cindy Lou Who (played by Cameron Seely). She is concerned for her overworked mother Donna (Played by Rashida Jones) who never demands a ""Thank You"".With Christmas Eve coming soon, The Grinch is irritated by the incoming ""noise, noise, noise""; all those toys that'll be played by girls and boys. In typical fashion, the Grinch gets a wonderful, awful idea. The plan to steal Christmas, it's decorations, toys and food makes him say eureka. With a coat and a hat, he makes himself look like St. Nick. By taking it all away, he hopes that this'll make a wonderful Grinchy trick. Meanwhile, Cindy Lou-Who sets her plan to catch Santa Claus. She wants to talk to him and help her mother with a cause.So does The Grinch outdo the original or even the live action movie? It depends if you want something more sentimental or goofy. Why don't we start with the Grinch himself, who feels too harmless. His personality doesn't spew annoyance and heartless. Benedict Cumberbatch plays him more like an eccentric loner who isn't that mad at the world. I guess I expected his performance to be a but more curled. Jim Carrey at least had the ability to go all the way with his image. It was an eccentric grump to the finish.So what's better then before? The animation and design galore. This is a movie that looks colorful, nice, and very Christmas filled. Seeing all those decorations and snow within the mountains makes me feel thrilled. It even feels more Christmas spirited then The Nutcracker. It's muted look and lack of plot made that more of a slacker. Even the live action Grinch's design seemed more polluted and cluttered. The new movie's way of working with the Dr. Seuss designs along with current Christmas decorations make it something to be uttered.But what about the morals? Does it dive into the Christmas issues that are still relatable today? Sometimes it does it fine, but other times it's a cliché. At points, it does look into the sadness of those that are alone. But given it never goes into the story's frustrations on commercialism, it does inspire a groan. At times, it feels like they don't want to adapt too much from the book. You think that by using much of the dialogue from before (which doesn't happen often), it would be more of a hook. I'll say that narrator Pharrell Williams just didn't work for me. Guys like Boris Karloff and Anthony Hopkins were more dignified and had voices that felt like sitting around the Christmas tree.I'll give this five Grinch faces out of ten. I think the heavy amount of families and children that'll like this will keep this alive. This doesn't replace the original. This just puts it with the others and becomes mixable. I'm okay with this, even if I wouldn't recommend it for myself. I'm more likely to watch the TV special that feels like an annual Christmas elf. Go see it, and see if it makes a mean one out of you."
140,"Loved the movie! The graphics are out of this world. Wonder why it takes so long to makes animated movies. It made me want t to be a kid again. I loved how they use today's world, but made it in a ""who-vile"" way. The story is different but In a fantastic way! I would say if you love Christmas, joy, and happiness this is a great movie to see. It's funny yes, but the story goes a little deeper than you think; especially for adults. Great atmosphere!!! My wife loved it as well. As far as Cindy, she was very special in this film. Don't go into theater I know what to expect because it's different. Give it a shot , or will make you smile and get you ready for Christmas."
141,"Hilarious and amazing, it brings back so much childhood memories! 😁😊😊😊😊"
142,"How can they make The Grinch but not have him say ""I'm the Grinch that stole Christmas?"" or at the end saying ""he the Grinch, cut the roast beast?""I realize I have watched the original cartoon & Jim Carrey's versions multiple times & didn't expect this to be exactly the same but this seemed not Grinchy enough."
143,"This adaptation was a pathetic retelling of the classic Grinch Story. It was more like a TV movie...it should have gone straight to video. Comedic moments were quite predictable and not very clever. And I guess even in Whoville there is death and/or divorce...the little girl did not have a father...only a mother.However, what really helped spoiled the whole experience was the voice they chose for the Grinch...it was definately not Grinch like. The voice was way too human...it sounded like the actor was just voicing himself without putting any feeling into being a true Grinch. The voice acting was quite bad with other characters also...the little girl's voice was high pitched and quite annoying...I wanted her to be quiet. They also had a stereotypical northwoodsman type of character that was voiced like he was a stereotypical character that just got off the train from South Chicago.Overall, this movie was really bad!"
144,"OK, tough competition Dr Suez and Borris Karloff.But someone should have killer it. Cumberbun is great in almost everything. Here he is lost. Evil no, good wants to be.Horrible. Protect your children. Killing worthy American culture. I can't imagine growing up with this as an example. Protest against Univeral. This is literally the worst turd excreted by Hollywood in years."
145,"Sadly I didn't enjoy this as much as I expected. It gone way off the story line to try and make it different. The kids behind me got so Bored they was dancing. If you seen the 2000 version you will just want to rush home and re-watch it. Illumination has let themselves down of what looks like a rushed job. There is no enough comedy in it, the way the Grinch has a change of heart is so boring. This to me has been a fail, I was really disappointed that I had seen all the jokes in the trailers, ruined the film."
146,"I am not quite sure why the overall rating is a 5, because this movie was amazing! It was funny, cute silly, heartfelt, and inventive! It will just absolutely melt your heart, the same warm feeling you get with hot cocoa in the snow, and give you that Christmas joy(unless it is made stone and two sizes too small) A great modern tale to the classic Grinch story. Fantastic and appropriate for the whole family. A great way to kick off the holiday season with all your favorite Christmas songs! I absolutely loved it!"
147,"Grinch the movie is an outstanding movie made by the best company, Illumination. It was an impactful, beautiful, and epic movie. One of my problems, is that my grandkids didn't understand the complexity. However, if you are over the age of 65, the movie is wonderfully crafted. One of the saddest moments is when the grinches heart grows three sizes. This is a very impactful moment, because nobody saw it coming. It was a very sad moment when the grinch dies. However, I love this movie"
148,Nothing like the book!! They changed everything and the Grinch is nice now. WTH?
149,"Disappointed even my son was bored lol what you see in the trailer is actually the best parts of the movie. It just didnt feel like a ""grinch"" movie. it's more like a money grab for just using the name. I recommend watching the live action jim Carrey version if u wanna watch the grinch for christmas"
150,"Wife fell asleep, I was bored and so were the kids. Jim Carrey's was so much more entertaining"
151,"The animation is wonky and it's generally unremarkable, but some of it works. Cindy was so cute and Benedict Cumberbatch was a great choice but his voice sounded odd like a Cumberbatch, Ryan Reynolds, and Bill Hader mix. It's not gonna wow anybody but no one will regret seeing it either. It sucks having to be compared to the fantastic original but for the most part The Grinch satisfies enough."
152,"Just watched The Grinch in theatre I work at. From the first released trailer they hooked me, so I had an advanced screening today. For me only.Story seemed to me kinda empty (obviously I had higher expectations), but it is just classic retelling of the same. The plot is classic Grinch tale - Whovilles are happy, Grinch hates it, they love Christmas, he steals it. But the little guy who really steals the entire show is Grinch's dog - Max! Every scene he is at - is so funny and cute,
The characters are great and charming, especially Grinch's dog and moose and Cindy Lou Who's friends. Other than that...it seemed to me pretty blank.As a years-long fan of Grinch's character - charmingly grumpy and bad, lovably mean Grinch, I give the movie score 7 of 10.Usually I will give the movie score 5 of 10, but thanks to great characters I gave 2 stars more.
I recommend this movie to take your kids in theaters - they will have fun, and hopefully you will too. If the story is not that good for you, the feel of classic Christmas spirit is what you get here and that I am sure you will enjoy."
153,"Illumination has yet again shown a complete lack of competence in terms of what makes a good animated movie.The magical soundtrack from the 1966 version is gone, and has been instead replaced by a combination of the overplayed Christmas songs that come around each year, and rapped holiday lyrics.The attempt at the ""modernization"" of this classic story is abysmal. The Grinch is no longer the antagonist from the previous iterations. He has been turned into someone who, excluding a few moments, seems genuinely happy. This makes the changes he goes through during the movie useless. By the end, nothing has truly been altered.Instead of focusing on a single central theme, this movie attempts to stuff in as many messages as possible. While the messages are technically present, nothing is developed enough to be memorable in any way. Overall, there is nothing to take away from the movie.This film is boring. The jokes were both predictable and bad. The story was weak. The animation is exactly the same as all other Illumination movies. Whos don't even look like Whos!This is a waste of time. Watch the original. Or even the Jim Carrey version."
154,Unfortunately I was a bit of a grinch in expecting this to be a flop and was proven correct. The 60's classic short that really sets the tone of a Christmas story we all want is superior in every way to this version and Jim Carrey magnificent take on the Grinch was always going to be close to impossible to top. That's not to say that this film isn't enjoyable but it just didn't feel like a Dr. Seuss beauty that we have come to love and know.
155,"Illumination's The Grinch is a less interesting interpretation than its predecessor films. Benedict Cumberbatch has a generic voice for the Grinch that could've been done by anyone. Pharrell's narration feels entirely out of place in this film. The Grinch's motivation is entirely unreasonable in comparison to previous films. Certain characters take a backseat and feel like plot devices more than anything. The theme is well done, like any Dr. Seuss story should be. The humor is dry. The soundtrack is out of place (Tyler the Creator and Brockhampton). Illumination's Animation is really crisp. I found myself more intrigued with the animation than the actual story. Overall, this is an average attempt at a Grinch story that'll likely be forgotten down the line."
156,The movie is just Ok.The character Grinch has been portrayed so well as we understand what made Grinch steal the christmas and feels bad for him.But the narration and screenplay is so weak that the comedies falls flat and it fails to engage.
157,Just another cash grab. Lacks any genuine heart. The Grinch is supposed to be mean and monsterous not just a grumpy neighbor with a pretty sweet bachelor pad
158,The new Grinch is a totally oppsite. The grinch is suppose to be mean abd hate christmas until the end. In the new flim he is way to cool with the thought of christmas. Spolier: he goes in town to get food in the morning without any suspense towards him. Plus he shower and wears deodorant. I will not waste time or money to watch such movie.
159,"Haha yeah. It was a good movie, just not a good Grinch movie. Looked great. Animation was awesome. But we didn't need that."
160,"As much as I love animation, the Grinch and doctor Seuss this film wasn't it and it's far from the quality of similar films like Horton Hears a Who! or The Lorax. the animation was on top but the whole movie felt very linear and narrow even in its 1.30h short length the story was unnecessarily stretched to reach that. I wish they went creative with the story and offered new rather than playing it safe with a shot relief that doesn't much the 1hour build up. even if it's hard for me to say this film was boring and needlessly."
161,"While visually stunning, the entire production feels ho-hum. Pharrell Williams as the narrator offers a bland and uninspiring performance. One can hear in his voice he actually wants to be somewhere else. Benedict Cumberbaugh as the Grinch is not scary, mean, intimidating, or even grinchy for that matter. He's not funny or witty - basically a forgettable character.The story line wanders between Cindy Lu and the Grinch. The scenes just roll along and the plot seems to suffer. There are few laughs and the music just doesn't work in the production.Overall, we are left perplexed as to why this Grinch movie was made. There is nothing to add here, nothing memorable. The writers shamelessly borrowed lines and settings from Up and Frozen, but misses the magic of those movies.The summary is a disappointing movie that would have been better served as a direct-to-video release. The colors and animation are lovely, but not enough to save the dearth of emotion and plodding storyline."
162,"Oh look, it's another cash grab from illuminations. Who would have thought that they were gonna milk every penny they can from Dr. Seuss and his work.Don't watch this..."
163,"First hearing about this, I was immediately turned off by the whole thing. The thought of one of my favorite, beloved Christmas movies from my childhood being rebranded as a animated cash grab made me sick honestly. Upon watching it in theaters, my original opinion was not changed. Continuity errors, unfunny humor and the social justice messages laced into the plot. It was - a mess to me."
164,"It was a cold and wet December afternoon so I took the kids, on the spur of the moment, to see the recently released The Grinch at the local multiplex.My wife grew up on Dr Seuss and so there was always The Cat In The Hat or Green Eggs And Ham to read to the little ones, no matter how hard I tried to hide them - I really don't rate Dr Seuss, there are too many made up words in the stories (good at rhyming as he was) that I always had a hard time trying to explain to the kids. But no Christmas season was allowed to pass without some version of How The Grinch Stole Christmas! being shown, along with Miracle On 34th Street, It's A Wonderful Life and various versions of A Christmas Carol - my favourite (and the kids, but don't tell their mother) being the Muppets one. I dare say that this one will join the library for Christmas's to come, but for no particular reason as it isn't the best, just currently the most recent.As I put above, I am not a Dr Seuss fan; please remember that. I am not a Jim Carey fan either, and had to endure countless replayings of his version (now 18 years old!) over the years; at least that film (live action as it is) was an attempt to be different from the original - and shorter - animation. This one reminds me of the 1966 original, with the added benefit of no Jim Carey (always a good thing).But this new version is unnecessary: it has a slightly different story from the book, which adds nothing to the well known plot that everyone knows. The Grinch is a lot less mean - which even my 6 year old daughter noticed and commented on, loudly - and (at the beginning) just hates Christmas; there will be some adults who will feel sympathy for him if, maybe, you've been forced to endure Christmas music in shops, malls or bars since the end of October or the endless seasonal adverts on TV. Maybe it is political correctness; we cannot have a character as mean as the Grinch representing Christmas when so many businesses depend on it financially to help them get through the year. Maybe we are not allowed to scare our children with a monster who decries the season, even though - like Scrooge in A Christmas Carol - he changes for the better (?) by the end. Maybe the producers looked at the other versions and, having got the go ahead to make another, decided that they had to make this one slightly different while staying slightly the same. Maybe it is just a money grabbing exercise by the film company. Who knows.But - spoiler alert - he is just...lonely.Benedict Cumberbatch was decent enough as the Grinch, I guess; he wasn't Jim Carey for a start. Maybe they told him not to be mean or to project his character's hatred for Christmas; if so then he wasn't bad, as such, just poorly advised. For some reason (the US market, maybe?) he put on an American accent (although my son still asked me if it was Sherlock Holmes!), but he was softly spoken and exhibited no aggression as such.
I didn't recognise any of the other voices; is that good or bad for an animation?Some things are new, not featured in the book or previous films.
Cindy Lou has a gang, who appear seemingly just for the purpose of setting up a Santa trap then just disappear.
There is a goat that bleats at Grinch and Max (the dog), but essentially serves no real purpose (is it a background character from another film?), although it did get the loudest laugh of the entire film.
There is Fred the fat reindeer (who looks like a moose - do they need to do more research at Illumination?) and his family - a potential short story animation filler character for the DVD, like all those Minion animations?
There is Donna Who, Cindy-Lou's mother, who has two toddlers to look after and works all night as well, and is the reason Cindy-Lou wants to trap Santa and ask him to do something nice for her; incidentally there is no mention of the children's father, a dark, hidden secret and maybe a sign that all is not sweetness and light in Whoville?
Oh, and then there is the dreadful Mr Bricklebaum; the sort of Christmas-loving neighbour you'd really hate having next door, who takes to heart the mayor's request to make the town three times as Christmassy and makes his home look like a perfect example of over the top decoration (not that anywhere else in Whoville is any less subtle and restrained in that regard), who believes Grinch to be his best friend in spite of the usual mild (and child friendly) insults, and has a guard dog called Mabel that appeared suddenly - yet without any introduction that I noticed - and was the only potentially violent element in the entire film (think Spike from Tom and Jerry for tenacity) in what makes do for the car chase equivalent in a PG rated Christmas movie for kids.
There was also a narrator who really put in a lot of depth and feeling into his appearance, didn't sound like he'd been asked to read something that meant little to him in any way - that was sarcasm, incidentally.Music - blurgh. Think there was one remake of the classic You're A Mean One, Mr Grinch which wasn't immediately identifiable (mumble much?), and there was a variation from the chorus of All By Myself by Eric Carmen (from 1975, and itself grabbed from a Rachmaninoff concerto, fact fans!), played on an organ by a lonely and depressed Grinch, which was fine for adults of a certain age but utterly lost on kids (I had to explain that one to my 12 year old son who looked across at me, confused, for an answer) because it obviously meant something yet they wouldn't get the joke unless they were familiar with the song.
There was also a bit of Christmas In Hollis by Run DMC which, again, is fine for adults (again, of a certain age) or those straight outta tha 'hood but, yet again, above the heads (way above) of the poor target audience. Overall the rest of the music was either lousy or just unforgivably forgettable, even after I cribbed from the music credits on this site.
One thing that really ages a film is the music used; sometimes an apparently timeless film will fail after a few years because while the plot carries on working well the music just lets it down. Happy and Despicable Me 2 work well, while having watched Sing within the last two weeks I can't remember any of the songs, although most were contemporary of the time (2016) or old classics. This film will be let down by its poor choice of music.The animation was probably the best thing about this film. My young daughter gasped when we saw Whoville all lit up for the first time. Some good snow and fur imitation too.
My kids, once again, liked the film. The 6 year old said she enjoyed it, and the 12 year old said it was ""alright, nice"", although in the car they started talking about Ralph Breaks The Internet (which they saw two weeks ago) and that is probably not a good sign for The Grinch.Alright: was the world waiting for another remake of this story - on the whole I'd say not. My children would give it (and every other film I take them to, unfortunately) a firm 10/10, but I am writing this review and feel that 6/10 is a little fairer (for using Run DMC's Christmas In Hollis, otherwise it would be a 4/10)."
165,"I saw this in the theater with my friend and we had a good time being cynical while watching this. It's easy to be cynical watching Illumination films because it's obvious that they're not going to change. They will always act on the lust for money, and they will always make the safest, easiest decisions. Although this movie wasn't as blatantly evil as ""The Lorax"", this whole experience was pretty lackluster and poorly thought out. The anti-capitalist messages were just brushed over as always, leaving nothing to take from this. I wasn't insulted, there was just nothing. Don't expext anything from Benedict Cumberbatch, because nothing stands out about his performance in the least. He doesn't even sound like a mean person, he's just kind of nasally (and American). Everything we know about him are traits we intuit from knowing about Boris Karloff's or *sigh* Jim Carrey's portrayals of him. He's just mean, except he's not even that mean here. Nothing about how he looks says ""I'm mean"", it's just what we already know. I feel bad for children who will grow up with this version of the Grinch because they're missing out on an incredible personality. Charater design in this is horrible as always, I mean why couldn't they have modeled the reindeer off of actual reindeer? They look ridiculous! They also changed Cindy Lou Who's character so she would be a copy of Edith from ""Despicable Me"". Not big on that. Also adding a religious song for the carollers just makes the story more complicated! ""The Grinch hated Christmas, the whole Christmas season. Now please don't ask way, no one quite knows the reason."" Well if Jesus exists in this universe, wouldn't that mean that all the other religions exist too? They never acknowledge this! What a horrible desicion! This is another example of less is more. The 30 minute short is still saying more, showing more and is more inclusive than this modern movie. They could reboot ""The Grinch"" as another hand-drawn short and I'd be happy, but I doubt that will happen. Overall, nothing interesting or memorable there. This is just another boring same-y throwaway movie."
166,I went to see this with an open mind. Knowing it wasn't going to be the same as the classic How the grinch stole Christmas. But still I was very disappointed. It's a good movie for the kids but still I wouldn't let my kids watch this one without seeing the classic first. I had high hopes for Benedict playing the grinch and I was let down because his voice over work sucked in this. Also who chose the narrarater because it didn't even have a homey feel to his voice. I mean come on it's a Christmas movie it's supposed to give that warmth feeling and it lacked. I walked out couldn't even finish it. Wasted money.
167,Never wanted The Grinch and Cindy Lou Who to have backstories.
168,"It was a sweet, predictable movie. A few giggles but not a laugh out loud movie. my 6 year old liked it but didn't love it. I recommend renting this movie, definitely not worth the money to see it in theaters."
169,"They had big shoes to fill (Dr. Seuss cartoon, and Jim Carrey) and they didn't fill them.
It's hard to screw up this story, but they did it.
Cruddy music and terrible story.
Disappointed that Cumberbatch took this on.
He's waaay better than this."
170,"It wasn't the worst I've seen, definitely not the best either. Pretty boring. I did laugh at the screaming goat. I don't understand why they chose to remake the Grinch yet again. New ideas/stories would be kinda awesome wouldn't it?"
171,"My daughter was obsessed over this after watching commercials on tv so I decided to take her. She was in love with it as any child probably would be. Since the grinch with Jim Carrey came out when I was probably the same age I couldn't help but compare the two. The animation itself was great, very vibrant and definitely how whoville should look. It is definitely a more gentle kind of movie for kids compared to the original. He seemed more of a depressed and agitated kind of grinch, instead of the horrible, angry and spiteful one that we are used to. I didn't like the narrators voice at all It seemed completely out of place. It's a cute movie but if your expecting the original you will most likely be disappointed. Also, did they explain where the dad was? I missed that I guess."
172,"It isn't that this wasn't a good movie, it just wasn't as good as the other two. It was a bit of a different take on the other Grinch movies, which may be the reason I didn't score it higher. It is a cute movie but nothing can compare to the other two!"
173,Great movie for the family & good animation. Not really sure why some people are rating it so harshly. Will definitely be adding it to the Christmas watch list from now on!
174,Benedict Cumberbatch's voice acting was inconsistent and didn't fit the character.Pharrell's music didn't work for me.
175,Dr Seuss short story of The Grinch gets a second big screen treatment.There was a very good short animated cartoon made in 1966 where the Grinch was voiced by Boris Karloff.This CGI animated version is colourful but bland. The songs have been updated by they come across as mediocre. The voice acting is below par. Benedict Cumberbatch does not come anywhere near Jim Carrey never mind Karloff.Here the Grinch hates Christmas because as a child he was always lonely at Christmas. Forced to go into Whoville during the run up to Christmas to stock up on food. The Grinch sees consumerism gone rampant over the festive period. Everything is bigger including the Christmas tree and there is forced jollity.The Grinch has a twisted idea to ruin everyone's Christmas. One girl Cindy-Lou wants to speak to Santa as she has a special wish. Maybe she can make the Grinch's heart two sizes bigger.Obviously the kids will enjoy this overlong movie. It lacks the wicked fun and zest of the 1966 cartoon.
176,"A perfect example of everything wrong with the culture of the late 2010's. The kids were cute, but that's about it."
177,"Very colourful, and beautiful visuals. I DESPISED the Hip Hop soundtrack though."
178,"Illumination made their version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. They've adapted one Dr. Seuss story already (The Lorax) back in 2012 and this How the Grinch Stole Christmas adaptation really misses the mark, in my opinion. Being this is the second remake of this classic story; I don't think I need to give a little bit of the plot in this review, at least.Because of the last couple of Illumination movies, Illumination is quickly becoming one of my least favorite big animated studios. The only movie from them I've really enjoy is the first Despicable Me. Everything else they've made over the years have been either very safe, mediocre films, or films I've really despised. The Grinch falls somewhere in between. I liked the first teaser trailer they put out when The Grinch being rude in the grocery store. I thought the movie might take place after he stole Christmas, like as a sequel, because of how he casually walked through the grocery store without whos fearing him. But as more trailers came out and proved this was a remake, I started worrying The Grinch would be really bad.There is at least some good I can say about the film. For one, the animation is good. I don't know if it's thanks to Dr. Seuss' stories having such a distinct look or if Illumination made more of an effort with this animated film versus their last couple of movies, but The Grinch's animation is really good. I'd almost give the animation category an 8, but there are a few character designs I did not like. In most cases with something is being adapted, I like when something is added to it that makes it it's own, like a specific director's style or look. There are things about some of the character designs (especially Max and Cindy-Lou Who) that remind me of Illumination's previous works. For some reason, when Illumination does something like this, it feels lazy, as if their reusing character designs of their earlier works and just tweaking things a bit. Max felt like he'd fit in the Secret Life of Pet's world and Cindy-Lou Who kept reminding me of one of Gru's adopted daughters in Despicable Me. I found it a little irritating.I like some of the gadgets The Grinch creates to steal Christmas and when it actually gets to that point in the movie (an hour into the film, give or take), I enjoyed it. There two other scenes I liked in the movie. One small scene is when The Grinch comes up with his plan. When he walks up a spiral staircase, his shadow is evil and twisted and it's the only moment in the movie that it's too safe and lets The Grinch actually look evil. The other scene I thought was actually good is the final scene in the film where The Grinch is invited to a Christmas party. I thought it was a sweet moment in the film. And that's really the only things I liked about the film: the animation and three scenes. Everything else was either bland or just plan bad.The absolute worst thing about the film and the thing that makes it a bad remake is that The Grinch doesn't even feel like The Grinch! The Grinch isn't mean enough or disgusting enough to be The Grinch. The only bad things you see him do are all in the trailers or when he finally tries to steal Christmas at the end of the film. He's nice to his dog, Max, and he only seems slightly annoyed with the whos. The creators of this film played it way too safe, wanting us to relate and feel bad for The Grinch. For the most part, he's just sad about being alone. This might have been fine, but the narration reminds us that The Grinch's heart is three times too small. In no way does The Grinch ever seem like his heart is three times too small. He's way too nice. His voice doesn't help either. Benedict Cumberbatch was a great choice for The Grinch, but he wasn't used properly. He should have had one of his deeper voices for The Grinch, but instead we get a wimpy nasally voice for The Grinch. I wonder if they thought his deeper voice would have been too scary for the children. It was such wasted positional.There were so many pointless side stories and filler in this movie to make it full length. Cindy-Lou Who in this film wants to trap Santa Claus so she can speak with him and ask him to help her mother for her present. They stretched this story-line so pointlessly. It even gets to a point where she suddenly has a gang of kids to help her. They're introduced like they might be important, but then they have one scene where they test out the Santa trap and then they practically leave the movie! The side plot of the fat reindeer was also pointless. I knew he was not going to be used in the stealing of Christmas, because even in the trailer The Grinch tells Max that he will guide his sleigh. There was one brief moment where Max gets jealous of the reindeer and I thought that maybe the side plot would lead to Max getting rid of the reindeer, but then the jealously is never brought up again, because The Grinch discovers the reindeer has a family and lets him go. The only reason the reindeer is in this movie is for filler, to be cute, and to have an excuse to have the reindeer and his family to save the sleigh from falling off the cliff instead of The Grinch!This is just a pointless and overly long remake of a classic. You're better off watching the original How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Hell, the Jim Carry one is better than this version. The Jim Carry version might have it's fair share of problems, but at I can appreciate it's boldness of trying to make it live-action and also have the added theme of the over commercialization of Christmas. Illumination's The Grinch is just too safe and misses the point of The Grinch's character. Imagine of Scrooge wasn't all that bad in the countless Christmas Carol adaptations.And don't get me started with Tyler, The Creator's rendition of ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"".

179,"Save your money.. Watch the original... Where is the dark undertone? What kind of PG nonsense is this. If I had children, I'd forbid them to watch this...Animators, you did a decent job. Well done."
180,"This is a reboot for modern times. The differences:First thing I noticed is that Boris Karloff and Thurl Ravenscroft are gone. They are pitifully replaced Benedict Cumberbatch who sounds like a real geek. The hip-hop version of the song was equally bad. Cindy Lou Who is being raised by a single mom. Whoville has some token diversity in the background, but not any main characters.The songs were Jesus oriented and not secular as before, however on the flip side, the Whos were concerned their presents were gone, unlike the first feature where they broke out in song, which I found more spiritually uplifting than their Christmas songs. What kid would recognize Nilsson? And anybody who does would have seen the original and be let down by this one. Who was the target audience?And did the guy giving away reefs sound like he said reefer? Couldn't they get Tony Todd or Samual L. Jackson to read the parts?"
181,"Firstly, I can't help but feel this is a remake.... But not of the Grinch. I think the director ripped off the original Grinch when he wore wrote Gru for despicable me, then ripped off Gru for this Grinch. He's a grumpy loner who after meeting a kind child, has a change of heart (three sizes) and then is a kinder person. That's the story of the Grinch and Gru and the reason I think he ripped off Gru here is this Grinch is like James bond in the third act with all his gadgets and gizmos.The story is three times longer than the original Chuck Jones story, but it's packed with filler and unnecessary scenes as a result adding no value.The original had a better character arc, better story, better character design, better pacing, better music, and better narration.Skip this one. It's not as bad as angry birds or the emoji movie, but it's also not as good as the original short or dare I say the Ron Howard Jim Carrey live action. My 7yo enjoyed it, but that's a low bar, so rent it for the kid and skip it yourself."
182,I don't think I or my family laughed at one joke. The story was stretched thin and the new added parts were worthless. The grinch and max looked right but Cindy was all wrong. The narration was meh and the music was no good. The remixed grinch song was garbage. Visually it looked great. I thought the animation was pretty good but man it's a slog to get through.
183,It is just a clone of the original movie same plot but a few changes that don't show up sometimes for example that cute raindeer it shows up sometimes and I'd think you should wait until it can be cheaper on Redbox or show up on Netflix.
184,"Though admittedly bright and colorful, this hour and a half long movie seems like it was made for free on TV. It is so forgettable that what happened in it almost left my mind as soon as I exited the theater. What's supposed to be emotionally deep just ends up being flat and one-dimensional, despite seeing it in 3D. The film tried so hard to get the audience to relate that I just sighed audibly. Oh, what a mess. The only good parts were the parts with the dog. All in all, don't waste your time."
185,"The general reaction to this film seems to be ""It's a totally unnecessary remake of a classic!"" Depending, of course, on WHICH version you're calling classic--the original book, the Chuck Jones-Boris Karloff TV special, or maybe you're a fierce Jim Carrey fan. Anyway, I predict that by this time next year this will be the go-to Grinch and will remain so unless or until a better, more timely version comes along. And Benedict was absolutely correct in choosing to play this Grinch in a Middle American accent. It would have been really weird if he hadn't."
186,"You will not regret watching it. The movie does an amazing job at depicting Dr. Seuss's story in the most wonderful way. I recommend bringing your kids with tou, guaranteed they will like it"
187,Please don't listen to the negative reviews. The people leaving negative reviews would probably give their life a 0 if they did not know They were reviewing themselves. This movie will go down as a CHRISTMAS CLASSIC!! It was so good I cannot wait to buy it on BluRay to watch with the kid for movie night. This movie will probably beat out Ralph breaks the internet which was my toss up of what to watch this month.
188,"I went to go see this movie with my little cousins. This was the first movie they saw in theaters, and they loved it. In their words, it was ""Awesome!"" I enjoyed it also. The movie is, of course, about based on the story that we all know and love. I went into the theater with high expectations because I'm a big fan of the Grinch movies and I have been since I was little. I appreciated that they tried to make the movie different from the others. I did like their attempt to make it more original, but there were some elements added that I did not like. The movie was funny and made me laugh, but I do think the humor was funnier to younger kids, which makes sense because it is a movie that was aimed to be for little kids. I gave this movie an 8/10 because I thought it could have been better, and I think they could have done so much more with this storyline.
All in all, I think this is a great movie for the family and would highly recommend it."
189,"There are some Christmas traditions that are non-negotiable for a vast majority of people; gifts, excessive spending, eggnog, mistletoe and of course, watching some of your all-time favourite Christmas movies. While everyone has their own personal favourites, I can easily bet that one of those holiday tradition films, thats easily labeled as a 'required viewing' for the festive season is the 1966 Boris Karloff TV special How The Grinch Stole Christmas! Growing up and even today, its hard to flip through the channels without catching the original special. Yet, no matter how many times we've seen it before, or what part the special is on once you flip onto it, you can sure bet that the special will more than likely be watched until its heart-warming ending. Too bad, I'm sure the same can't be said with the 2000 live action remake starring Jim Carrey.Luckily, 2018 has brought us a new, brighter and greener Mr.Grinch. From Illumination, the studio that brought us those adorable little minions we can't get enough of, The Grinch is a vast, richly coloured, fun and most importantly, loyal addition to the Dr. Seuss canon; proving that sometimes, changing too much of a good thing, isn't always better. Instead, Benedict Cumberbatch's newest interpretation of the Grinch is loyal to the Boris Karloff original, channeling his wicked sense of humour, dark and twisted hate of a joyful holiday and its gleeful spirit and most of all, some exceptionally great voice work.While almost everyone knows the basic narrative of the original story, this version pits us in a similar Whoville that we are all used to, but this time, the Mayor of Whoville, Mayor McGerkle (Angela Lansbury, yes the mayor is now a woman) declares Christmas be three times bigger; kind of ironic for a guy who's heart is three times smaller than the average heart.At an hour longer than the original film, you would think that screenwriters Michael LeSieur and Tommy Swerdlow would dabble deeper into the past of a cute and small little fella, yet, despite brief flashbacks of a baby grinch in an empty orphanage, these questions aren't really relevant in a child-friendly animation film in 2018 thats main intent is to cash in on cute and memorable commercial products for the 2018 holiday market. Even with very short and quick flashbacks of The Grinch's Christmasless past, our miserable antagonist cannot seem too shake off these awful memories, no matter how much people around him, including the most cheerful who-of-them-all, The Grinch's neighbour Mr.Bricklebaum (Kenan Thompson) tries to cheer our foul smelling greenie; nothing seems to glow his cold, cold heart.Although its been over fifty years since the original aired, and almost two decades since the live action remake, there is something special about experiencing such an iconic cinematic character being cherished by children for the first time. Luckily for myself, despite all the genuine laughs, gags and jokes that I found myself chuckling to, one fo the best parts of experiencing The Grinch was hearing the cheers, laugher and questions of the kids around me in the theatre. Asking their parents why he is so mean, why is our titular character is so green when everyone is 'normal', and if the movie is done with every fade out. Despite the endless kicks to the back of my seat from the youngster behind me, nothing melted my heart more than hearing their little chuckles with every thrown snowball and sight-gag involving The Grinch.Illumination, who luckily decided to really modernize the original story, and add its signature flare of whacky colours, vibrant animation and silly humour, does a fantastic job of staying true to the original, without ever compromising the fresh and radiant look of this 2018 version. Keeping many of the original characters was also a great choice, including the girl who challenges the grumpiness of favourite animated Scrooge, Cindy Lou Who (Cameron Seely), as well as, one of my loyal favourites, Max, the Grinch's trusty yet sweet and loyal sole companion. Max warms your heart with each smile, wag, bark, drool and use of his powerful puppy-eyes.Yet, while the 2018 Grinch is a faithful interpretation, there are a few additions that we cannot help but fall in love with, including a yack-like looking reindeer Fred. Fred may be a tad overweight, have a slight obsession with whipped cream and pretty well eat anything in his sight (including Grinchie's hair), Fred is a fantastic addition to the world of Dr.Suess, especially this adaptation of The Grinch. Along with Max, the two front-runners to guide the Grinch's sleight that night, give the audiences the majority of the laughs to a newly vamped up Christmas classic.While The Grinch's message of warmth and wonder is simple and never really changes between fifty years and three adaptations, it seems like each and every year, all of us need a real reminder of what the holidays are all about. Changing the ending slightly to fit in a much more grounded and relatable holiday setting, especially for children, 2018's The Grinch is a warm and welcomed addition to our holiday traditions."
190,"I love the other versions of this film, so to see this new spin on it was so fun! I love the different story lines than the other films, which gives it a new twist. I'm so glad they came out with another movie!"
191,"It's obviously not better than the original 1966 special, but it definitely is a good movie to watch."
192,"The Grinch presents a zestful and umfaltering melodic that combines sheer voice acting with a complete yobeling. After such an impressive voice role as smaug in the Hobbit series, the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the lead voice actor is a je ne sais quoi that fits the bill for a successful box office"
193,"This movie was hilarious, sweet and heart warming. Definitely going to be purchasing when it comes out on DVD. GO SEE THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW!!!!"
194,"I went to go see this movie with my little cousins. This was the first movie they saw in theaters, and they loved it. In their words, it was ""Awesome!"" I enjoyed it also. The movie is, of course, about based on the story that we all know and love. I went into the theater with high expectations because I'm a big fan of the Grinch movies and I have been since I was little. I appreciated that they tried to make the movie different from the others. I did like their attempt to make it more original, but there were some elements added that I did not like.

I gave this movie an 8/10 because I thought it could have been better, and I think they could have done so much more with this storyline.
All in all, I think this is a great movie for the family and would highly recommend it."
195,What is this EXCREMENT? The style is all WRONG. The buildings and layout don't look anything like the illustrations from the book or cartoon. The Whos don't even look like Whos. The characters new personalities are unapealing. The Narrator is positively unbearable. The choices of addition songs and music is nauseating. And they changed the ORIGINAL SONGS! You DON'T mess with a classic unless you can improve it... And they DID NOT! This dreadful mess should be BURNED!
196,"I haven't heard one person say a good thing about this movie.
Kids were so bored in the theater they started playing in the isles and parents were sleeping.
The hip hop was so out of place and felt forced.
Not one joke landed. Silence throughout the theater besides kids talking out of boredom.
Just overall wouldn't recommend"
197,"Very cool interpretation of the Grinch. It keeps you interested in whats going on and the characters grow on you. I love the look of the Whoville. We really liked this one, if it was on TV we would definitely stop to watch it and those are our favorite types of Christmas movies. Good job Illumination!"
198,This movie has a great message that's appropriate for the whole family.
199,"I do not like Illumination. I find them to be one of the most money hungry corporate film producers working today. Where Disney, Pixar and even occasionally Dreamworks make actual artistic pieces of film which are beautifully told and animated, Illumination use the cheapest methods possible to get an easy reaction out of both children and the idiots that fall for their tactics. Another reason I truly despise this company is because they made the ""Minions"" which are one of the worst things I've ever seen. I was sitting in the theatre waiting for the film not expecting much then before I even got to the dullness of ""The Grinch"" I was forced through five or six minutes of purely unfunny Minion antics. When I saw the horrible outline of the freakish creatures I groaned out loud in the theatre. After I managed to suffer through the painful experience of the Minions short ""The Grinch"" came on and to be honest it was just as bad.There is a few things a comedy animated film is supposed to do. These things are:
Be funny.
Have good animation.
That's all I requested and I received neither. To start the animation style was very boring and ordinary, I saw the new ""Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse"" a while ago and the animation in that film was unique and stunning and that is due to Chris Lord and Phil Miller caring about their film. The people behind ""The Grinch"" couldn't care about making the film actually good. A problem I have with Illumination's animation style is the constant reusing of both sets and character models and although this film was much better for that than the atrocity that was ""Sing"" I was still able on many occasions to notice many reused models.In terms of the comedy I wasn't expecting much, maybe one or two laughs. I didn't laugh once. I didn't even smile. This film was not even mildly entertaining, it was just so boring. It wasn't even like there was some awful jokes I could make fun of! This film had nothing interesting about it whatsoever.In conclusion I utterly hated the hour and a half I endured this unfunny, lazy mess. Don't give Illumination any money to see this film. 2/10."
200,"Took the family to see this movie.... what can I say about this film that's positive? The animation was good and that's where it ends. The sound track was horrible and did not make you feel like it was a Christmas film, except for the carollers in town for a brief second, even the classic grinch carol was down played and faded out. The plot had too much going on, I realize they wanted to twist it a bit, to try to get away from the same old story, however I felt like the town didn't even really know who he was. The grinch felt invisible to the towns people in this movie, which is ironic as he was the main character, but when it gets to the classic ending of the grinch I felt as if the towns people were like "" Who is this guy? Do you know him?"" Epic fail. Really wanted to love this movie but I just can't, so disappointing."
201,"Now, I am not a fan of Illumination. None of their films really stand out to me. The only good Illumination movies are the first 2 Despicable Me films. Their other movies are just films that only appeal to the lowest common denominator like Minions, The Lorax, TSLOP, Sing, etc. Today I am reviewing their latest film, The Grinch. The film in general was VERY poor. The story was forgettable and boring, the animation was too simplistic and empty. No detail in it whatsoever! The movie in general was very forgettable and bland and was simply only made to cash in on the success of Illuminations other films (and the 2012 Lorax film). Don't waste your money on this, go take your kids to watch a better film."
202,"Perhaps it's because I grew up with the old animated version of this Seuss tale. Perhaps it's just because it isn't what I had hoped for. But this movie was something of a disappointment to me.First, the positive: the animation is really very impressive, very imaginative and creative.On the negative side, I thought the first part went on too long, for what there was to it. Perhaps Mr. Bricklebaum could have been developed in contrast to the Grinch, since he seems to live by himself as well. Perhaps something else could have been done. Or perhaps it could just have been shorter.The second half engaged me more. The story development made the Grinch resemble Mr. Scrooge a lot - the person who hated Christmas because, as a boy, he had had to spend holidays alone - and made him much more sympathetic than I remember from the old animated version. Though there was much sugary food to be seen, the story itself was not made too syrupy.I don't know if little children will enjoy it. Perhaps if they have read the book beforehand. I found much of the additional script, which is not in verse, to be flat and uninteresting.Sorry to be such a grinch. I had really wanted to enjoy this movie more."
203,This was a movie I wasn't sure about but I'm so glad I went the movie made me thing made me smile made me laugh so much to be enjoyed here not to be missed that's for sure take the kids see it on a date any way Is fine just see this movie
204,I actually thoroughly enjoyed this take on the Grinch and Cindy Lou Who was the best yet.However that godawful cover of You're A Mean One Mr. Grinch has got to go.
205,It really was a cute movie. Yeah somethings were very predictable because we all have seen the original or the Jim Carrey version a thousand times but this one was funny and colorful. I did like that they showed grinch being affectionate to max. Worth the watch. Did not like the grinch song though.
206,"Ok! So I went to see this on the day of release and I can say, as a 14 year old, I enjoyed this a lot. I haven't laughed so hard at an illumination film since the first despicable me. There are plenty of scenes that allow laughs, tears and most importantly allow you to have fun. If you love the original starring Jim Carey then you will definitely love this!"
207,I really enjoyed watching the Grinch from what he did and from what he learnt from in the movie. As well as the animation that had hard work to be made as well as the story.
208,"I have to admit The Grinch was a very good film. The only downside was the size of the Whos' noses and how the cinema told me 2 hrs and 10 minutes which was highly inacurate. This film was very good, but I didn't understand why Benedict Batch-of-Cucumbers had to put on an American accent. The Grinch is an annoying, cuddly character and honestly I don't understand why Mr. Batch-of-Cucumbers wasn't in the original. (I went to the film in my special Grinch slippers)"
209,"Truly brilliant & genuinely laugh-out-loud family movie. It was touching at points & was totally relatable at times. It's colourful & memorising to watch. Probably one of the best kids films ever made, up there with Horton hears a who. Highly recommended."
210,Probably one of my favorite versions of a classic! Definitely a must see and will have a place in our Christmas movie marathon every year.
211,"I went to see this movie with no prior knowledge of the grinch. I mean, I knew he didn't like Christmas, but that was about it. This movie was very colorful, explored whoville thoroughly, and had interesting characters and dialogue throughout.Starting with the grinch himself, I have to say his character was really good, and his chemistry with max was really nice and cute to see. I do wish that they delved more into his backstory, which I learned more of post watching this film, but the story they gave was sweet, and enjoyable for me to watch. His transformation from a grumpy grinch who hates Christmas to having his eyes opened and feeling loved by the people of whoville warmed my heart, and was very nice to see.When it comes to the supporting cast, sadly they're mostly weak and lackluster, but they don't need to be anything more. The Cindy lou family, however, was awesome! Hearing rashida Jones as the mom was nice, considering I'm a big fan of hers, and the story of her being a single mom with 3 children is sadly relatable these days for a lot of women, which at the very least made it feel more modern and realistic. The little girl Cindy wanting her mom to have an easier time with life as a whole (simplified, but still) was sweet, and this ends up being what swayed the grinch to mend his heart a little. She isn't afraid of him and even invites him over for their Christmas dinner, which was very heartwarming and is really what the spirit of Christmas is, at least for me.The side things to note about the movie would be the visuals, and the jokes. While there aren't many jokes thrown in the movie, there were a few that had me laughing a lot, and I still laugh about it now. Some were hit or miss, but I still thought they were funny. Now when it comes to the visuals, the movie nailed it! It was very visually pleasing, seeing the mountain the grinch lives on, seeing whoville, the people there, the houses, etc. it all looked very good. Also as a side note, the gadgets the grinch used were so freaking cool! Would watch again just to see that part of the movie.I'm not that critical about movies as a whole, and this movie for me was a sweet, cute, fun experience that was worth the $8.50 I paid to see it. 10/10 would watch again!"
212,"The Grinch is a colourful and visual spectacle and a guaranteed joyride for the children and even for the adults too. Even though the critics response were mixed, I suggest every person with his family should have a go for this one. Benedict Cumberbatch nailed as witty yet emotional 'The Grinch'.."
213,It's the story you know (or may not)Funny in parts with a heart warming message.
214,"I just finished watching The Grinch. I will be the first to admit that I was worried about how I'd like this Grinch. I am a traditionalist and really only like the original cartoon since it is the book with songs (I grew up reading Dr Seuss and love all his books). But I was greatly surprised on how much I liked this version! I knew the cast was good and I'd like the acting because of the cast (the real reason I went to see it was the casting); however, I was worried about the story. Again I was pleasantly surprised by the feels I got from this version (I cried during the movie). I loved it! Recommending it to all my friends!!"
215,"Time honored classics hold a special place in our hearts, sometimes to the point of being unable to ever be touched by remakes or other twists. Still that does not stop Hollywood from trying to find ways to make an idea modernized to help reel in new generations. Sometimes these twists are amazing to the point of becoming the new standard, while others should remain in the thought pool to develop some more. Tonight, Dr. Seuss' legendary Grinch tries to come in with a chance to make itself relevant to the new age. Will it run with the two previous versions that are the big dogs in holiday cinema? That's where I come in. Robbie K back this week for the first review on:Movie: The Grinch (2018)Directors:
Yarrow Cheney, Scott Mosier
Writers:
Michael LeSieur (screenplay by), Dr. Seuss (based on the book by)
Stars:
Rashida Jones, Tristan O'Hare, Scarlett Estevez
LIKES:Animation: In the modern age of computer cinema, I agree that the new visual style is a welcome addition to the series. Illumination's style goes well with this movie, the cartoony visuals, bright colors, and odd shapes fitting right into the imagination of Dr. Seuss. Little ones will appreciate all the energy in the design and the magical heart of Whoville in their love for Christmas. In addition to all the colorful and fun displays, the Grinch and company have wonderfully smooth animation, crisp and clean to capture all the slapstick shenanigans these movies are famous for.Voice Acting: Not many here, but Benedict Cumberbatch is the lead in this movie, showing off his voice acting skills once more in a fun manner. Perhaps not the most elaborate character in his repertoire, this Grinch has a number of octaves and mannerisms to get my nod of approval, as Cumberbatch once again adds life to the artificially crafted characters. Cameron Seely as Cindy Lou Who has some sass to the classical, good souled who that still has that innocence, but with the modern twist. As for Kenan Thompson, he is funny in his one-liners that take you back into the 90s where he reigned king.Cute: The movie is a family friendly film, with that youthful energy to kick off the holiday season and get you onto the mood. The Grinch brings that modern tale to full light and the new twist has been tailored towards the target audience of 4-10-year-old kids and the young at heart. In addition, all the comedy and story will potentially make your heart grow three sizes.The Creativity: Say what you want about the others installments of this film, but this Grinch gets bonus points for the clever twists brought into the heist scene. Yes the first one was brilliant and went in time with the song, and Jim Carey's version had the darker, fun delight that was a little spooky giving the lighting. This one though, adds gadgets and technology that were rather Seuss-like and most likely the subject of action figures and toys alike. Still, the Grinch's new genius is just another nice twist to the mix, again matching the talents of the voice actor who portrays him.The Dual Stories: One part is the tale we've come to know and love, while the other running tangent is a small story that gives us more Cindy Lou Who. The Movie does a nice job of having the two key characters trekking down their own paths, each blazing their own path as they head to the fateful night. It's not the most character centric story, but it works well for me and gives little girls a new animated character to pull for.DISLIKES:A Little Too Simple: The Grinch's modern twist is perfect for the modern age of kid themed movies, being innocent, sweet fun that leaves you with a feeling of Christmas. Yet, the movie still is a little to simple, lacking those qualities the previous installments held that made the memorable. Perhaps a little more story, a little more heart, or just some more injection of adult components into the mix could have taken this film farther.More Character Development: The Grinch seemed rather simple, but the Jim Carey version proved this green curmudgeon held more story than ever imagined. Sadly, this version sacrificed characters for the slapstick gimmicks to net kids in. Sure, there are backbone framework established, but there was so much more discovery and tales to tell to help strengthen the film. Other characters could have been involved as well, but they were only momentary colors on the screen, with a few one-line jabs to get some chuckles. Nevertheless, the movie needed more character utilization for this guy.Predictable/Shown In Trailers: No surprise that the Grinch is predictable, but why could it not have escaped the curse of the revealing trailers. The Grinch's surprises are ruined mostly by the glimpses in the trailer, leaving you with little to discover past the meat of the film. There are still some special gifts hidden under the trees, but perhaps not in the brightest, shiniest style it could have been.More Cindy Lou Story: I know it's called the Grinch, but they opened the flood gates for another story that could have been even cuter. Cindy Lou's story introduced lots of characters that could have again established more of that twist, perhaps giving it that special something this version needed. Fortunately, there was a major finale to help wrap up and inspire, but some more development was needed in this component to really add that final finesse.The VERDICT:The Grinch is a tough challenge to take on given the champion films we have in the past. Still, this reviewer enjoyed the fun adventure that is appropriate for the whole family. The animation, design, and comedy are all for the intended audience and one might enjoy seeing their little one's face light up at the magic of Christmas unfolding. Sadly, the movie still has some work in terms of bringing more to the table, taking the story and gimmicks to the full potential by injecting a few more unique features to escape the trailers revelations. Still, I applaud the new twist for the creativity and think that a family outing can warrant a visit. Yet, the classics are free and available at home, and that may be difficult to miss when they are so good.My scores are:Animation/Comedy/Family: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.0"
216,A nice family fun movie! Recommended this to everyone.
217,"Don't listen to the scrooges out there who didn't like this film. Their hearts are just 3 sizes too small. 😜This movie was surprisingly wonderful. I saw it because it was Benedict Cumberbatch. I loved it because it is a wonderfully heart warming story. The original is a legend unto itself so there's no point in bothering with a comparison. However, I will say that this version's back story makes perfect sense for why the Grinch feels like he does which makes the whole story feel more complete than other versions.Ultimately the real comparison is with the Jim Carrey version and as much as it pains me to say this about a Ron Howard film, whom I adore, I believe this one totally blows it away.Jim Carrey is just sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo over the top (see what I did there?)
The king of ""extra"" ""excess"" and over-acting nearly suffocates the story with all his antics and the weaker sublots caused that movie to drag.
Not this one, though! This movie stays on course and Benedict Cumberbatch delivers a Grinch who starts out a curmudgeon and as his story unfolds you really do ache with his teeny little heart. And the relationship between the Grinch and Max might just be one of the best buddy team-ups in any movie ever! It's simply the best!
I tell ya guys- a great movie will make you laugh and cry in a single sitting. This one most definitely delivers!"
218,Okay so this is a movie I consider well worth seeing not only does it make you feel good but makes you smile and feel all Christmas like not to.mention it'll make you laugh a few times. I highly recommend you go see it over the holidays and you won't be sad you did trust me
219,"I absolutely loved this movie, usually the grinch creeps me out but the characters in this movie were so lovable and even the grinch was not as horribly grinchy as usual instead so humorous and adorable. The ending too was so perfect, I just loved it all!"
220,"I think they missed the opportunity to play ""Your a Mean One Mr. Grinch"". In the beginning, yes they did play a stupid version or something. They also did get ""Welcome Christmas"" right either. I'm disappointed that they didn't do any of the classic songs and just replaced it with stupid Christmas music. They didn't get Cindy Lou Who right, she looked way cuter in the Jim Carrey one. It was really funny though. It was way better than the original, but not the same as the live action one. I would recommend this one if your looking for a good animated Christmas film, but as a Grinch film, watch the live action one."
221,"The Grinch is funny, sweet, and very well done. Super story and visually a real holiday treat! The child in me was awed, and my daughter (age 4) was enthralled! My husband really enjoyed it, too. Can't wait to own it and watch it every year!! Happy Christmas!!"
222,"I'm glad the graphics of Grinch and Max stayed the same. Storyline more fitting this generation, great engineering by the clever Grinch. Characters more diverse. Loved the ending's details...didn't think it could get better but glad it did. Thanks dr Seuss...we think all ages will love it as we did (two seniors and grandson 9)"
223,"Apart from the minor fact that the narrator's adolescent voice tone lent no gravitas, sophistication, or other quality point to the film, the entire package was a perfectly acceptable new interpretion of the character and story.The music was fine, and the delightfully festive Whos of Whoville even managed to sing two traditional hymns - God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen and Silent Night.We were three generations who saw it, and each generation found something to enjoy. How wonderful that this relatively modern story about the true spirit of Christmas continues to find new outlets for interpretion.(The negative critics do realize this is a work of fiction, right?)"
224,"This animated retelling of the classic Christmas story really had no big red flags, but it still left a lot to be desired. The animation was detailed and quite impressive at times. The supporting characters had some funny moments. I believe the story was lacking because our protagonist never truly felt like The Grinch. He had so many moments of happiness and inspiration that his final objective never felt meaningful. With all that said, The Grinch is a solid film to put on for the kids."
225,"Of course I'm going to read reviews! And I saw good ones and bad ones. I gave it a 7 because I wouldn't buy it. But, yes, it was good and the 11 girl and 14 year old boy I was with said it was good. Small kids will eat it up. I grew up with old Grinch but I wouldn't buy that one either. Take your kids to see it! It was actually really great on the big screen! Colorful, playful and gave me some new decorating ideas!"
226,"As a mom with a 2-year-old and 5-year-old, I was thrilled to find out this Grinch movie was geared toward children who actually still believe in Santa, like mine do. I took them both to see it and they both sat through the entire thing. Nothing presented was scary for children their age and it has a wonderful feel-good ending that kids will love. I loved the spin on the family story for Cindy Lou and it gave the movie a breath of fresh air. It was a perfect family night out."
227,I liked the new take on a classic story. I'm glad they didn't completely copy the previous grinch films
228,"The Grinch in this version is not as mean just misunderstood and treats his dog Max as an equal and best friend, but his only friend.He grew to dislike Christmas due to a childhood incident. That made him despise the holiday and in the wanting to plan to ""steal"" Christmas meaning gifts and toys and decorations.People who grew up with the original with the late Boris Karloff will bring their own kids to see this and it kind of still follows that version.But the people of Whoville are happy go lucky and that they love each other and show kindness even to the Grinch. Will they turn on him as he ""steals"" their Christmas?Benedict Cumberbatch is great in the role of in the titular character. Cynic but sympathetic and misunderstood all at once."
229,"Great feel good film but couldn't get my head round why they left out Cindy's dad, Lou Who. They even changed her moms name from Betty Who, to Donna Who. These details might not be big to most people but why change a beautiful story.Overall it was fun my girls loved it and Fred was our favourite character.Jim Carey's version is still my favourite!"
230,"I almost didn't go see this movie because of the reviews, but I'm so glad that I didn't listen. From the cast to the music to the animation, this movie is perfection! It is everything I wanted from the original Grinch. I actually like it better than the 70's Suess version. In this movie, the Grinch is a more sympathetic character. If you were bothered by how the original Grinch treated his dog, you'll love this new movie. I can't wait for the DVD :)"
231,Great to see the grinch back.. my kids loved and so did I!
232,"After reading reviews I went into this movie with low expectations. We were very pleasantly surprised with the overall story. Plenty of laughs, touching moments, and content true to the original movie. Definitely a great way to get you into the holiday spirit, and remember the true meaning"
233,I was on the fence about this one from the start as I really don't see anything toping Jim Carey's Grinch.. but I really Benedict Cumberbatch and figured my kids might enjoy it too. Overall it was a pretty decent funny film with some different spins on it which made it a worthwhile watch. Don't understand why there's so much hate.. it's a movie. If you don't like it then don't watch it. I'd recommend this to anyone with kids.
234,"I was nervous to see this movie after so many negative reviews, but I really thought it was a cute movie and I don't even have children. If you don't go into expecting it to be a replica of the live action or the original, you won't be disappointed. It's visually striking, has several comical moments, and still carries the plot of the real meaning of Christmas. Yes there are some parts that are very different than the original and live action. There are some new characters and background story, but I didn't see that as a bad thing. Why would you want to watch something that's exactly the same as what's already been done?"
235,"Overall I really enjoyed this movie. I think the super low ratings were a bit harsh.
I enjoyed the incredible colorful scenes/ animation style, the emotional aspect of it, the modern twist of Cindy Lou Who having a single mother. It truly brought me into the Christmas spirit. It kept me entertained for the most part while other scenes could have been done in a few minutes rather than 15 minutes.
I did not particularly like how they were constantly flying all over the place, and crashing into things. Not my type of humor. Also parts of the plot were dragged out. overall a great film for the family!"
236,"I watched this movie a year after it's initial release. All through 2018, from the very first poster, to the latest trailers, people were criticizing this film. I had low expectations when I first started playing it, not enjoying Illumination's The Lorax. Illumination is like a Diet DreamWorks, with it's reliance on celebrity cast, low brow humour, and predictable storylines. I think they have the ability to blend these elements together better than DreamWorks (here, for instance), and there's no denying the influence that their movies have had on pop culture over the years. There's a lot in this movie that mimics other Illumination movies, notably the art style. If you're a fan of the humour in that film, you'll find a lot of it here.
It was brave of them to attempt this movie, knowing that the original story resonates so strongly with so many people. It feels as though they really poured everything they could into this film, celebrating all versions of the story.The biggest positive for this movie is the portrayal of Christmas. The design of Whoville is absolutely stunning, I love how the town is more vertical so we can really see the whole thing. There are decorations everywhere, though it never feels visually distracting. Since much of the background is white, we have all of these bright vivid colours that really pop. The long swooping establishing shots do such a fantastic job of firmly planting us in this environment, and establishing the atmosphere. The unsung hero is the lighting. On the tree, at night, or the warm glow inside a window: it feels very magical, and very nostalgic.I was pleasantly surprised by their interpretation of Cindy Lou. This movie gave her more to do, and gave the audience a stronger reason to connect with her. Because we have all this time with her, the climax becomes more impactful, her words have more value as a character foil.There are two major issues with this movie. One is that it needed more time devoted to the most important aspects.
Cindy Lou's major motivation is her mother, and though we got two scenes establishing that plot point, I feel as though they missed an opportunity. There's a scene right on Christmas Eve where she's tucking Cindy into bed, that could have been drawn out a little longer. Just one more beat of her working hard or how tired it leaves her to emphasize that point, and to make her character go beyond the homekeeper stereotype that she's presented as. All the Whoville scenes are shown from Cindy's point of view, this is how she interprets her mother to be, but I still feel as though there was room to expand.Because of the slapstick, the Grinch ends up back in Whoville. I think doing that cheapens his plight. There was a lot of build up to this big Christmas tree, but nothing happens with it. We're also briefly shown the Grinch's childhood, but whatever impact that it has is accomplished in other ways: if it's through the departure of Fred the reindeer, or at his toast at the end. This time could have been devoted to putting his plan into action on Christmas Eve, the reaction of the Whos to the event, and his catharsis. The whole third act feels a little rushed, and unsatisfying.They took the title How the Grinch Stole Christmas literally, by giving him a few days to prepare. Seeing his thought process, and his inventiveness was the best direction they could have taken with this movie. It felt very focused on the original story. It's what a reimagining is supposed to do; recreating the source material with alterations to expand on the established lore (in a way that fits the original tone of the narrative) to rectify plot holes, and to make the piece more palatable for modern audiences.Both aesthetically, and to his core character, the Grinch changed and this is heavily, heavily criticized. For the story that they wanted to tell, these changes were necessary.
A lot of thought, and intent goes into creature design. The more unrecognizable his features become, the more unsettling he becomes, and that's not the point. We still have the green visual cue that he's an outsider, but the audience can better relate to the character due to his softer design: it makes us take his motivation more seriously, consciously or not. His design works cohesively with the other Whos when he walks among them, and this movie presents that as the ultimate goal.I personally don't mind how well he treats his animals. People, or substitutes for people, have an inheritly different relationship with animals than with other people. Knowing that Max will never intentionally betray or hurt him makes the dynamic more inviting. If the Grinch does truly fear loneliness, as depicted here, then why would he treat his only companion with malice? Keeping in mind that this movie is intended for children, and because of that, every little thing about it is open to be picked apart. They needed to avoid glorifying bad behaviour, and implement positive morals for that demographic. There were moments of genuine Grinchiness at the beginning which were effective.I think we have higher expectations for films than in previous years. We expect something visually stunning, and immersive, we expect strong memorable characters. Stories inheritently come from the idea that people are interesting: it would be hard to sit through a movie with a static protagonist for an hour and a half. Because we see ""nice"" elements earlier on, it's not such a 180 turn when he has his epiphany: we can see that developing the whole time.
It also fits in with the themes of the holiday, which is primarily family, and togetherness, and the message that Illumination wanted to convey. No matter how bizarre their behaviour and values may seem, give people a chance to prove your initial judgement of them wrong. In that vein, it's the most similar to the original cartoon.The other huge problem that this movie has is the muddled messages. The original cartoon was straightforward in this aspect. The Grinch viewed the Whos as very shallow people who idolized, and celebrated greed and self interest over the needs of bystanders, and Christmas was a huge vehicle for that. That's why he self imposed this exile away from them. When he stole everything, and the Whos adapted, that was when his perception of them, and of the holiday radically changed. Here, the Grinch's motivation isn't very clear. My best guess is that he wants to make others feel bad, because he feels bad. I like the idea that he doesn't quite know why he's doing it, but that's not the impression that I get while watching.The narrator has a line that goes something like: ""Taking toys they didn't even need"", and for a narrator who is supposed to be giving us the events as they're happening onscreen, that's a very blatant bias. Where is that coming from? Earlier he referred to the town being like a dream, so this could be a nod to excessive wealth and prosperity, but we know that isn't always the case from Cindy Lou's mother. So who's our narrator? Is it just a reflection of the Grinch's thought process? After he returns the gifts and decorations, he says ""I stole your Christmas"", so he doesn't learn the same lesson of the original story.The whole ending, and the expansion of it, I liked a lot. It was amazing how natural those changes felt, and the direction that they were able to take with it. It just needed more time devoted to it.The Grinch's new motivation is because he's lonely. This could be explained a little better, because we see him going into town, we see people trying to connect with him. There's no reason given for him living so far away, because it's not the people that he particularly detests, at least from what's shown, it's the holiday. I feel like they were trying to tackle past trauma, and mental health, and I'm glad that we're getting that representation, getting diversity, and complex characters, especially in kids movies. They did stumble a little by making light of eating disorders in the first couple minutes, because if some issues matter then all of them should.Christmas isn't just stuff, everyone deserves to be treated with kindness, it feels like they're trying to take on many morals and themes. I don't know it the whole blend of them together in this movie was successful.This film suffers from being made in this decade, because you're likely to think ""Oh, this is just Green Frozen"", or ""This is the Lego Batman movie"", and that can be very distracting.There was a remix of You're a Mean One in the very beginning. I could understand why they would choose to have that be an introduction to the character, but I think it should have been moved, if not to the great Christmas escapade, then maybe when he's in town, and we actually see evidence of his behaviour rather than being told at the beginning what to think. It's a different style, and genre, and I could see how it would throw some diehard fans off. Fahu Foris was good. A lot of the music is either traditional carols, which really helps establish the environment, or specially created Christmas raps, which I feel like that's typical of Illumination movies. Not quite sure if those work as well in the context of this movie, with the story that they want to tell.I feel like it was only natural for Illumination to tackle this story. Christmas is a pretty stagnant time for entertainment, with the same songs and shows on repeat for 60 or so years, so I really appreciate that they brought something new to the table. What they made is charming. It has heart. It means well. There are elements in this that are accomplished better here than in the original cartoon. The inverse is also true. It feels like a pretty tight story that carries some emotional weight to it. It's good for opening up discussions about ways to handle your feelings, and even if that's not what you want to get out of it, it's still a fun, wholesome Christmas movie.See for yourself."
237,"I have to say up front that I liked this movie. Not loved but really liked. I viewed the Grinch as more a comical character. Because he was so funny and happy in some scenes, Just meant he was hiding his true feelings of hatred and depression because of Christmas. (I refer to real life comics that have died from their own hand hiding behind the comedy.)That being said, This was a good movie because of the strong female roles of this tale. Cindy Lou and her mom are strong points of the true feeling and meaning of Christmas. There are many sub plots in this movie but are all tied together through out.I did like the three Grinch movies but for different reason and perspectives. This Grinch is just different from the others but comes together in the same ending for all.It's all in your preference and taste."
238,Overly long and boring and turning the ginch song in some hip hop trash is inexcusable
239,"This retelling of The Grinch Who Stole Christmas didn't disappoint with a good amount of laughs and some pretty touching moments. It doesn't exactly match the comedy brought to Jim Carrey's adaptation of the amazing Dr. Suess tale, but definitely comes with the same emotion as it. It's very enjoyable and an great film for the whole family to enjoy!"
240,"It was fun and funny, but they added some new characters like Fred, and I didn't like it much. They also made the grinch too nice in my opinion. I know they had to lengthen the story for a movie, but it still made me a little triggered."
241,"The whos were like the book. Grinch was only mean to Whos, but not Max or reindeer. Max was more corporative with Grinch than usual. Grinch says less than half of what he said in the book. It rushed when he started stealing which was an hour after movie started. Grinch's origin wasn't enough. I will say Jim Carey and cartoon version were better than this."
242,"Another re-telling of celebrating the birth of Christ. Just kidding. It's about excluding and distrusting someone different from us until they are driven to justify our mistrust. But it is narrated by Pharell, so be happy. In the end, the people of Whoville befriend the outsider so they can be smug about having one green friend. Of course, they could have just built a wall.
All in all, a more polite retelling of a classic that brings nothing new to the party beyond rap versions of the Grinch song.
But seriously, is there a Who Christ? They have Christmas so it stands to reason that there was one. It is not addressed in this version either though. Oh well, I'll ask around. Maybe Horton heard something."
243,"Welcome dear readers, you're in for a treat,
So get in your bed or pull up a seat.
The new Grinch film is out, so now is the time,
To write a review, all done in rhyme.
So Grinch is the movie, I'm reviewing today,
And my kids are with me, I hope that's ok?
Written by Dr. Seuss, The Grinch is quite mean,
He lives high on a mountain, and is rarely seen.
When Christmas comes around, he gets awfully mad,
He takes it out on Whoville, it's really quite sad.
There's also one little girl, with one wish to make,
She doesn't want presents, just her mum to get a break.
The Grinch though is different; he has other things on his mind,
And we are shown in flashbacks, just why he's so unkind.
He thinks of an evil plan, to steal Christmas from the Who's,
Hoping that they will also feel the blues.
Will his plan succeed? You'll have to watch to find out,
I don't want to spoil the ending, the finish I will not flout.THE GOOD
Let's get to the good stuff, and tell you what my kids liked,
Mr. 8 loved the dog Max, while I thought the animation was out of sight.
Mr. 5 said he liked everything, especially when Grinch was caught,
I think he was more interested in the chocolate I had brought!THE BAD
Now onto the bad stuff, this film feels quite long,
To stretch a small book makes it boring and wrong,
Mr. 8 felt the movie stretch, so did the kids in the crowd,
While Mr. 5's one complaint was that it was too loud.Overall I must say, the kids did like the movie,
While me and my wife, thought it wasn't so groovy.
I'm not the target market, I think or I guess,
If my boys enjoyed themselves, that's fantastic god bless.
Mr. 8 says it was great, a four out of five,
While Mr. 5 gives it four, I was just glad to survive.
A three is what I'll give the Grinch, it was just fine,
Story way too long, but animation sublime.
So that finishes my review, I hope it brought you some cheer,
All that's left to say is.... Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!"
244,"You simply cannot not like a Grinch movie, but this isn't my favorite version of the iconic tale. However, if you have little ones, there is no doubt they will enjoy it."
245,"The GrinchThe easiest way to ruin Christmas is to redirect all Amazon shipments to the Third World.Thankfully, the party-pooper in this animated movie lives a cave with no WiFi.A green hermit named The Grinch (Benedict Cumberbatch) watches over Whoville from his mountaintop with much disdain, particularly for its obsession with the yuletide. To quell the joyous season this year, The Grinch hatches a plan to impersonate Santa so he can pilfer all presents and decorations from the neighbouring township. Meanwhile, a Whoville child hopes to capture Claus so she can make a wish for her overworked mother (Rashida Jones).Outside of the sappy single mom storyline, Cumberbatch's nasally performance and some slick animation, this adaptation of Dr. Seuss' children's book pretty much follows the same narrative of the far superior 2-D animated TV special.Moreover, if The Grinch hates Christmas so much he should just convert to Islam. Yellow Light"
246,"Although the film was very cute, coming from my prospective it did not do the job that the Grinch Gooroos needed. The Grinch is a classic film, and this just was not very good to say the least. If I were a 6 year old child, I would give this film a superb review- but I'm not.
6/10"
247,"The Grinch (2018) is another generation's interpretation of the classic Dr Seuss tale, this time bringing it into the world of CG animation via, *sigh*, Illumination Entertainment.Benedict Cumberbatch takes his own crack at the lead role and as always, he has big shoes to fill. He does it competently but certainly not iconically, while also surrounded by a supporting cast of other great voices (including the always welcomed Kenan Thompson)That problem with Cumberbatch translates to the rest of the film. Competent, but not iconic. Which is hard in the world of Christmas movies, but is a shame in the world of Grinch adaptations. Though that is combatting the classic cartoon with Boris Karloff and the ode to make-up that is the live-action movie with Jim Carrey.The Grinch just lacks something about it. Thankfully it's not a prequel as the first poster threatened, but there is some origin hinted at that is one of many moments that needlessly build on the original formula.Inclusions and homages to the classics work. Every now and again you get the Seussian prose that puts you in the right place, and you get music that takes you back, but once again, it doesn't quite have iconography to hold you. You're blinded by nostalgia and the trap that is Christmas.Make no mistake, much like The Grinch you'll be blinded by how Christmas is nailed from its sight and sound. Emotionally you'll be hit by it, but taking a step back it's just the classic Christmas cheer and ideology that's holding you.The film's not bad, The Grinch does well in its medium here, the animation is your usual kid-friendly slapstick fare and has a bunch of visual jokes (that don't always hit, like a 3-scene joke with a goat that doesn't land at all) and to a degree looks great, though my viewing was in standard 2D and nothing fancy so I didn't take in the full extent of it all.It's crime is the usual crime of movies at the moment - the crime of mediocrity. Too many movies I could give that stamp to, but The Grinch is a middle of the road film with a few blips of greatness but for the most part it's purely just a cheaper imitator.Do not pass up the previous versions for this one, not rush out to add it to the Christmas rotation. There are dozens better Christmas movies to watch, the majority of which are not CG, and the best of which probably has Muppets in."
248,"This is the classic Dr. Seuss story put to theaters in animation. I'm going to say that it's better than the Jim Carrey version. Well, not by that much really. I admired the animation at least. This is probably the second best Dr. Seuss movie next to ""Horton Hears A Who!"". I think the running time was good.It worked have worked better as a short film. Well, it already DOES work better as a short film. Maybe it's because I've seen so many movies that I can't really find anything good or bad about it. It's completely harmless in every sense of the word. It really just doesn't add anything new or interesting to the story. It's just so-so. **1/2"
249,"This movie was entertaining but missed many things from the original story. Most of all how could not have He's a Mean One Mr. Grinch song, that's one of the classic sing alongs of the story. As I said entertaining for kids and family but not at all like the classic or even the Jim Carey one."
250,"This is a 45 minute film fluffed out with an extra 45 minutes of paint-by-numbers cliché plot points. In spite of the plot, the 'paint' is very well done, as the animation and attention to detail is superb."
251,"COMPLAINTS:
Grinch doesnt look mean, just someone whos in a bad mood beause they spilled their coffee.
*Some parts stray FAR from the origainal
*The plot is, well, Decent.
*Many pointless scenes.
(In my opinion, Jim Carreys Live Action Grinch is better)
Illumination, for those who didn't know, purposely make average movies that aren't that expensive to make, and have famous actors in them so everyone goes to see them, and then Illumination then gets tons of money because of that. They purposely stick Minions all over their logo so you think, ""Oh it's the company that made the Minions! Then this movie will be great!"""
252,"The classic Grinch movie gets a 21st century makeover. How was it? Not bad. This might be the maximum amount of content a director is able to squeeze out of a relatively short children's book.The voice acting is solid, the characters are likeable enough, and the visuals are vibrant. Add a couple of cute animals for some ""aww"" moments and you have a generic family animated film. This movie neither innovates nor takes any chances. It's safe, like chicken noodle soup - just a little bland.If you read the book or watched the original animated Grinch, you will know what is going to happen before it does. The are no plot twist that will keep you wondering. To the movies credit it manages to stay true to the source material while adding a some modern, shall we say, accessories?This is not a great movie. It is also not a bad movie. The movie simply ""is"". Fans of the classic Grinch movie will enjoy this film. Kids will to. This is a movie you can safely turn on for nearly any audience without worrying about offending someone. That itself is a noteworthy trait. While ultimately forgettable, The Grinch (2018) will keep audiences (moderately) entertained for it's 86 minutes of run-time and then fade from their minds as easily as it came.Harsher critics might dismiss this film as a corporate cash grab pumping out an unnecessary remake in time for the holidays to make a few bucks. And they might be right. However, in the realm of unnecessary remakes The Grinch at least makes an effort. The film has heart, and good family values. Sometimes the experience of a feel good film can makeup for mediocrity in other areas. I think that is the case for this film."
253,"Benedict Cunberbatch, whilst bringing very little more to the role of the grumpy green Christmas hater, delivers a likeable, fun performance in a middling animation that, while not being bad, is certainly forgettable."
254,"How do you take a Christmas classic and turn it into some rap thing? It is just about money, no taste, no quality. Kids didn't like it. Not Christmas movie. Whoever made this should be embarrassed."
255,"I know this will upset some folks, but the 2000 version of Dr. Seuss' classic, ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" was an abomination. First, the entire message of the original story was lost...and was, in fact, the opposite of Seuss' story. Second, the story was all about Jim Carrey and his mugging for the camera....everything else seemed secondary. Because of this, I was terribly disappointed, as I loved the original story and the great 1966 cartoon. Because of this, I was very reticent to watch this 2018 incarnation. But, in hindsight, my fears about the latest film are mostly unfounded.Because the film is about an hour and a half long, I already realized that the story had to be padded and include some new material...this is just inevitable. However, I was surprised how much I liked this material...such as the Grinch's cute reindeer. It was very pleasant and all contributed to the story instead of distracting from it. And, as far as the story goes, it stuck pretty close to the book--even using many exact quotes from the classic tale.As far as the quality of the film goes, it's a mixed bag but mostly good. The animation was eye-popping and wonderful. It really is great on the big screen and the 3-D effects were magnificent. I also liked that they made the Grinch a hater of Christmas but NOT a hateful or evil character. He was kinder and more sweet at times....even though he hated the holiday. The only things I wasn't thrilled about were the narration by John Legend and the voicework for the Grinch himself by Benedict Cumberbatch. I had the distinct impression that BOTH were used simply because the studio could get them--not because they were appropriate for the film. Legend is apparently a nice guy...but his nice-guy voice wasn't what you'd want or expect from a narrator. The same for Cumberbatch--who DID sound very different from his usual English accented voice but still was too 'normal' a voice for a character such as the Grinch.Overall, despite my voice talent complaint, the film is a great family film...one that honors the book and 1966 film instead of ignoring it like the 2000 incarnation. Well worth seeing and amazingly heartwarming...especially at the end as well as when the Grinch is interacting with his dog and pet reindeer."
256,Great movie. Much better than the Jim Carrey version. Wonderful animation. Nice story. Terrible songs.
257,"I was honestly surprised by just how forgettable The Grinch turned out to be. There isn't much to be enjoyed with all the cliches, predictable scenes, cheap looking animation and unfunny humour.The story doesn't feel very well planned out at all. The majority of the movie just consists of The Grinch screwing around and it just doesn't feel like the plot is going anywhere.Also, the B plot made me realise that Illumination seem to be really fond of the whole 'mothers work so hard' story for whatever reason.Thankfully, the movie isn't filled with ear bleeding pop songs like The Lorax (if you ignore the weird cover of 'You're a mean one Mr Grinch' at the start of the movie).There's this reindeer that they added in for whatever reason who adds absolutely nothing to the movie and seems to only exist so he could make an 'epic comeback' towards the end or whatever - it's really stupid.Anyway, long story short: this movie sucks don't watch it."
258,"It was enjoyable enough, and there were a few modern additions that added some humor, but the narration and switched up lyrics to the original Grinch song were terrible...sorry Pharrell!
The animation was beautiful, but there were too many minor characters who really added nothing to the story and were completely forgettable, in my opinion. Stop trying to remake classics!"
259,"I saw ""The Grinch"", starring the voices of Benedict Cumberbatch-Dr Strange in the Marvel movuies, Star Trek:Into Darkness; Cameron Seely-The Greatest Showman, The Jim Gaffigan Show_tv; Rashida Jones-Angie Tribeca_tv, Parks and Recreation_tv and Kenan Thompson-SNL_tv, Snakes on a Plane.
This is an animated version of the Christmas classic-I think the last version was a live action movie starring Jim Carrey. Benedict plays the Grinch, an unhappy and miserable creature that lives just outside of a town called Whoville. Everyone in Whoville are just the opposite of Benedict; they are friendly and happy and love Christmas. Benedict decides to make all the residents as unhappy as he is by disrupting their holidays. Rashida plays the mother of Cameron, a little girl that wants to teach Benedict the true meaning of Christmas and Kenan is another cheerful resident of Whoville. It's a fun family film-a little early for the holidays-that has a lesson to be learned.
It's rated ""PG"" for rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would probably buy it on DVD for the grandkids to watch."
260,"I've never been a big Grinch fan but had to give it a watch to see how BC did. I was pleasantly surprised by the additions mixed with the expected facets of the story, hip hop music and traditional carols, Cindy Lou and her posse of friends, The Grinch, Max and Fred etc. I would recommend it, I thoroughly enjoyed this version."
261,"Ok yes, I gave it 10 stars because it was funny as heck and it was so cute. But the Grinch wasn't ""the grinch"" he was, for the most part, nice and not too grouchy as the grinch is supposed to be.
They totally changed the image of the grinch. I didn't like that..
However, Cumberbatch did a good job playing the voice of the grinch but nothing can ever top Jim Carrey who killed it as The Grinch.
I will still recommend this movie to people because it is a really cute family movie and very funny."
262,So they've changed the story. Now Cindy Lou had no dad. The Grinch isn't really a Grinch. The only thing this movie has going for it is decent animation. I'm glad I didn't spend money to see this at a high dollar theater. I give it four states merely because of the religious Christmas carols. Otherwise it would get 0.
263,Third time is not the charm. Although fun to watch the movie is slow. You'd think that they would speed up the fun in this one but it stays a a constant pace. Kenan Thompson was the best part of this movie. His energy was obvious. Good movie for this kids. Parent will appreciate the quiet time it provides and the odd chuckle here and there.
264,"While this version of the Grinch is certainly is a more visually stylistic, less threatening and socially relevant one, I can't help but feel that it was over-stuffed and a little unoriginal. The side story with Cindy Loo Who trying to trap Santa in order to help her overworked single mother seemed to only be a tool to fill up time.Nevertheless, despite not being the target audience, I did find this film funny and entertaining. I truly loved this version of the Grinch character because I relate to him a lot (social anxiety, depression caused by loneliness and emotional eating). Benedict Cumberbatch does a great job at providing a nuanced, witty portrayal of a person embittered by years of solitude.Although it does suffer from being third in place in the adaptation of the Dr Seuss story, it's probably my favourite one so far."
265,"A light hearted, cheery, feel good film. Very much in keeping with original Dr. Suess. No foul language or
off color scenes. Good clean fun! A perfect new Christmas tradition. I think Dr. Suess would be proud to have his name on this one! Great for kids of all ages. My only regret was that my petsonal favorite quote from the book was not included."
266,"It was a very good remake of the Boris Karloff cartoon, made it to movie length just long enough any longer my granddaughter would not have sat through it. The addition of Fred the Reindeer was clever, we both laughed through the whole movie. Thoroughly entertaining!"
267,"I'm not a big movie goer, but Mrs.O loves the TV Grinch and I decided to treat her to the film version. We were the only patrons in the theater for the show time we chose. Like having a private showing. Great plus was the sound was not at bleeding ears levels, very normal. The production values were top notch. Cute characters and dialogue. Don't get any negative responses. I'm guessing it will get chopped up and be shown on network TV by next Christmas."
268,"Finally a kids movie that actually manages to stay fun and innocent. So often these days kids movies are filled with crass jokes, innuendo and unnecessary 'adult' content in the hopes of keeping parents engaged. This retelling of The Grinch movie was none of these things. It had kind and caring characters and heart warming morals throughout. Perhaps the Grinch himself could have been more 'grinchy' at the start to show more of a change of heart towards the end but we all know he's the bad guy anyway. Both myself and my kids (aged 4 and 6) enjoyed lots of laughs and there was a good balance of slap stick humour and more clever comedy. The visuals were great and I enjoyed the soundtrack featuring Pharrel. Being a Christmas movie it might not be one that you rewatch through out the year but I think we'll watch it again. We all need a little kindness and love and this movie encourages us to show both to everyone no matter who they are or what they've done and that's something to celebrate any time of the year!"
269,"I admit I was deeply cynical going into this one. I have a deep love for Chuck Jones' original cartoon (I can just about recite the narration by heart) and the memory of Jim Carrey's disastrous version was still fresh in my mind. Also, as much as I adore the Minions, there was the fear that Illumination would overload it with burp and fart jokes and ""over-hip-ify"" the material.Imagine my surprise when the finished product turned out to be a delight. It may not follow Seuss' text to the letter, but it's definitely in the spirit of the original. It delivers a believable story about a loner grouch who's gradually driven to rage by the relentless cheeriness around him until he snaps and commits the ultimate act of grand larceny. The parallel storyline about Cindy Lou Who and her quest to talk to Santa in person had a modern feel without seemingly self-consciously hip (she and her friends were reminiscent of Gru's girls in the Despicable Me films). And, yes, there was a bit of crude humor, but it didn't distract from the overall storyline.Most impressively of all, they managed to give the Grinch a believable motive for his attitude without hammering you over the head with it, adding poignancy to the ending. (This is something that could have gone horribly wrong if handled badly - see the Johnny Depp Willy Wonka). The result was a more, well, human Grinch. (It's also notable that this incarnation is a lot kinder to his long-suffering dog, Max, than previous ones).Plus, Illumination went all out with the visuals for this. Whoville is a Christmas wonderland. Mount Crumpit is appropriately bleak (but still with a touch of Seuss-like whimsy), and characters look like 3-D versions of Seuss' creations while also working as modern CGI creations.Overall, the Jones version is the gold standard of the Grinch, but this is a worthy modern take. There's something here for all ages to enjoy."
270,"I am finding it very hard to review this title as it really is so very similar to the original starring Jim Carrey.I have given this an 8 Rating as a stand alone film its good. i Love animation and this does the job nicely, i love the story, the colours and its not too long a film. The problem i have is that i absolutely love the original and the reason to go see this was because of that but that then lets me down because it doesn't give me any better.if you go see this having not seen the original its very very good and if you have seen the original then its just very good.overall a good film, Animation is great and sharp and for the kids is fab."
271,"As a Dr Suess fan and being raised on the original TV special cartoon from the 60s I had my reservations about going to see this film. I was pleasantly surprised and relieved that while they did stray away from the original story, they didn't use it to push an agenda. They made it relatable to todays kids but kept the original theme of the the original story that Christmas isn't about the stuff you buy but about spending time with the people you love. It was also lovely that Cindy Lou Who wanted to help her mom instead of wanting loads of stuff for Christmas. I still prefer the original with Boris Karloff but this is a great film you can take your whole family to from the very young to the very old and all enjoy it!"
272,I was at first a little nervous about seeing this reboot but I'm glad I did. The over all look of the animation is good. I really liked that Illumination Entertainment went with the Original look to the cartoon and it was interesting how they made it for this new generation. It's not great and it's not Jim Curry . But it is a good reboot.
273,"I'm not a huge fan of Illumination but at least their past movies have a distinct POV. The Grinch introduces high-tech tweaks to the story but other than that, strays almost too far from the pop culture humor route. At the same time, the script lacks the substance and magic it needs to become a Christmas classic.A big miss was Benedict Cumberbatch's voice generic vocal performance. Not sure why he didn't choose a deeper register because it literally sounds nothing like him.The one bright spot was Keenan Thompson. He played a small role but earned the film's few laughs.Overall, skip it and watch it when it's free on streaming. It's of similar quality to Smallfoot - but I'd choose Smallfoot hands down."
274,"Let's all remember what we are watching here... a Dr Seuss book. The script cannot be way off topic, the storyline is set. If you think you're going to see a movie with an original plot line and a surprise ending, think again. This is the Grinch, that's what it is. I found it to be very kid friendly, fun to watch, and it preserves the original. I didn't really find Grinch to be very unlikable at all and I appreciate that the Christmas songs were about Christmas and not revised for the politically correct. The 3D was well done and I'm sure enhanced the show, I recommend it. My only question mark was the choice of music, why not keep the original ""You're a mean one..."" Six stars....worth a visit before Christmas."
275,"3/5: This movie was okay. It is worth it to see it in theaters but if you are excited about other movies, I'd see those over this.I love the Grinch. All the films and just for the fact that it is a Christmas movie that isn't all the same as the others. I came into this film excited because I really enjoy Benedict Cumberbatch as an actor and figured he would do a great job as the Grinch. To keep it short, he does a great job as the Grinch. This movie was different from what I expected though. The Whos when the Grinch would visit weren't in fear of the Grinch. They didn't avoid him, there are characters that openly try to embrace the Grinch. While the story of the movie has this tone makes sense, it was weird throughout seeing this. The best part of the film is Max. He is the character that helped me enjoy this movie. The bonding between Grinch and Max is adorable especially if you have a pupper at home. The Whos really take back seat in this film and that was fine because they really didn't enhance it much for me outside of a singular character and a few scenes. This is not a bad movie, I just don't think it is necessary for theaters. If you love the Grinch, I recommend a viewing but with movies like Overlord, Widows, and Girl in the Spiders Web, I feel that your experience could be better served if you're more excited for those films.TL;DR- This Grinch is the least grinchy of them all. Max and the animal pals make the movie fun to sit through because they are adorable. If you love the Grinch, I'd say see this but if you're excited for other movies this week and next, save your cash and see those."
276,"The live-action version was an abomination containing adult innuendos and unfunny jokes. This version is great for kids. My girls have been rewatching their favorite moments over and over again. I also like that the Grinch seems human. He clearly loves his dog, and his past helps to make sense of why he hates Christmas. Is it perfect? No, but it's a fun movie that doesn't deserve the hate some people are giving it. It's rewatchable and endearing, and it's now part of our family Christmas movie yearly rotation. You should check it out!"
277,"So many powerful messages packed into this small movie. In my opinion the best Grinch version to date, with a Grinch who is real, rather than a cartoonish unreasonable villain. It speaks to the human condition, the need to be known and loved even with our imperfections. And the effect that kindness and forgiveness have on others. I really can't understand the low rating for this, nothing about this movie felt cheap or lazy. Definitely worth a watch."
278,"It would be nice if these kinds of movies/animations that have traditional roots could be kept that way! We don't need rap/hip-hop in every new rendition of a classic, and we don't need that horrible 'gadgety' space-age feel to everything!The narration and music are terrible, and the movie just feels rushed."
279,"So I just saw the new ""Grinch.""
It was something for me to do.
And now it's done and over.
The experience is all through.The storyline was pleasant enough.
The performances are nice and mild.
The animation was just wonderful.
It was crisp, vivid and wild.But saying all that praise,
there's still something eating inside.
Something that's wrong with this new movie...
It's a fault I cannot hide.It's a concept that's alluring,
For a film that's not too long.
But stretching it to feature length...
was a decision that felt wrong.There's a brilliant thirty minutes,
of story here to tell.
But certainly not for eighty six.
It makes it a hard sell.But at least it was better than the Jim Carrey version,
which is a film too over-hyped.
It was unpleasant and tedious and overstayed it's welcome.
One might call it some plain-old tripe.But let's get back to the animated endeavor,
and how I'd rate this new remix.
Looking at it from an objective opinion...
my rating would be an average six."
280,"It's a Christmas cartoon... I dont think they set out for Oscar nominations, so dont get your panties in a bunch people."
281,"The Grinch is a largely unnecessary, sometimes sweet, sometimes funny, animated cashgrab.I re-started watching this 87 minute long film at the 60 minute mark with my fiancé who missed absolutely nothing by dipping in with 20 minutes to go.It reminded me that I missed Pushing Daisies, itself a Wes Andersony riff off of Dr Seuss. As it is, The Grinch is exactly what you expect, a more sugerpuff saccharine version than Ron Howard's much-derided live action entry, that I very much enjoyed, and still do."
282,I think this is a great adaptation of a classic book
283,This was hilarious and captured the meaning of the story brilliantly. Loved the narration and Max the most. The Grinch was super mean in the beginning shoving a kid in snow and trapping a jolly man and they really explained the transformation.
284,"I really liked this remake. Touching, funny and interesting throughout. Worth the watch!"
285,"One of my favourite holiday movies! It was a refreshing take on an old story. I watched it in theaters and wasn't a big fan, but I found myself thinking about it a lot. So I watched it again, and it hooked me in.The kids aren't brats (what is with the media normalizing kids being jerks to their parents?!), the storyline was intelligent, Max was adorable, and the Grinch was open to growing as a person. And c'mon, who can't laugh at a cartoon character who addresses emotional eating in a way we can all identify with?!So he wasn't super duper mean. Oh well. Why can't someone do something different with the character? Was Jim Carey's version absolutely brilliant and timeless? Yes. But the clean and colourful visuals, and even better hip hop soundtrack, really helps tell the whole story instead of focusing on some bitter stuck in his ways.Maybe approach it from a different perspective, and you might appreciate how cute this film is. In the meantime, I'll send some love to the people who hated this movie. Ya'll need a hug."
286,"We watched this without knowing much about the real Dr Seuss story.Our overall reaction/impression of the film was wowed by the world they created here. A microcosm universe for the story, lovely snippets of the story through narration, an easy to follow plot, and some sweet moments.It wasn't perfect, there were a few too many slapstick action mishaps for no apparent reason, and some jokes fell flat due to interesting choices of angles or distances in their execution, but all in all we enjoyed this film and would recommend it."
287,"I love the Grinch story and grew up watching the original cartoon version every year. I was excited when the Jim Carrey version came out and it is my favorite Christmas movie. I finally got around to watching the ""new"" Grinch this year and it was such a huge disappointment. The whole movie just feels wrong - the character's voices (especially the Grinch) are awful, the whole theme of the original story seems lost, and the movie seems to drag on. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I did like the goat and I enjoyed some of the classic Christmas songs they included - BUT they ruined the Grinch song. Since they were deviating so much from the original story anyway, they should have incorporated the goat as a reindeer or at least given him a bigger part in the movie. IMO they would have been better off coming up with a whole new story instead of trying to retell a classic. FAIL."
288,"I found this movie to be a very refreshing new version of the Grinch. As versions of the grinch from the past have pointed back to the Grinch's difficult childhood, and how it influenced his desire to ruin Christmas, this one especially highlighted his troubled childhood. All throughout the movie, viewers were encouraged to be selfless by seeing the lonely struggles of the young grinch, and Cindy Lou Who's selfless endeavors to help her friends and mother. Kindness and love are the main features of this movie, which points to the characteristics of Jesus Christ, the reason for Christmas itself. Although there were no explicit references to the birth of Jesus, the actions of the Who People, as well as Cindy Lou Who align themselves with actions everyone should mimic. I was very pleased with this film."
289,"My fiancé and I hated the trailer for this remake. So we avoided it. This Black Friday, it was on sale for about $8, which I thought was a reasonable price. I picked it up, and she and I watched it. Now we regret not seeing it in theaters.It wasn't perfect, mind you. There are many changes we didn't like (Cindy Lou's mother is a single mom, for whatever reason; they also RUINED the original Grinch song). But the humor was there. It worked. Our biggest fear was that, since this was made by the Despicable Me people, this would be as bad as all of those flicks. It was much, much better, I'm thankful to say.I'd certainly say it's not even close to the quality of the first two Grinch flicks. But it was nice, and we laughed a lot. How many kid films make you laugh, these days? Not many."
290,"This was a delightful find on Netflix this morning. It has the strongest sense of wonderment and holiday cheer of any of the adaptations. Best of all the film makes the Grinch's character arch stronger and more apparent. The gags droll while being engaging for adults and children. Cumberbatch's Grinch is a little softer than the 60's one, and a lot less surreal than the Carey's character but he sticks the landing with a great turn.The film is at its best with visual storytelling. The actual robbery of Christmas is the best part; it feels extremely Seuss with its whimsical gadgets, visual puns and striking design. This was just glorious to watch."
291,"I grew up in the original (and hated the Jim Carrey version), so I almost didn't watch it... Today, I thought what the heck, I can turn it off if I don't like it. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! I enjoyed it from start to finish! The music was on point for today, and they mixed in traditional Christmas songs, too. I enjoyed the animation and voices for the characters. This will be on my must watch list of movies for years to come. Merry Christmas!"
292,"Don't listen to the critics. If you have small children (mine are 2 and 4 years old), the movie is great! We watched it like a million times this month and they still enjoy and laugh out loud at every funny scene. This Grinch version is more likable, so it makes it easy for children not to be afraid of him. A very good colorfull quality christmas animation with an amazing soundtrack. Enjoy!"
293,I watched this version for the first time a few months ago and I've watched it about 30 times since. I've definitely enjoyed this version.
294,"I really like how they tackled the theme of trauma and depression as a real reason for the Grinch's actions. In the original, he just seems to be a grumpy jerk with no explanation as to why. In this film, you realize that considerable pain and isolation is part of the reason why he is who he is. I think it's great that they've tackled mental illness in a subtle way to help kids empathize. Still love the classic though lol!"
295,"The most unrealistic thing about this film is how the Whos start decorating for Christmas on December 21st. down at my local mall, the Christmas trees are always up by November."
296,"Saw this movie with my kids...and wished I hadn't wasted the money. Jim Carrey version made some changes to the original animated version, but it still captured the Grinch.This one, he's sad, lonely guy looking for a friend."
297,Horrible remake. Terrible writing & script. Epic casting failure from the voice of the grinch right through to the narrator.
298,"The Grinch certainly looks like another deeply average animated flick, but is certainly not. The Grinch shines with vibrant animation and some fun voice work that works more than it should. It certainly is entertaining, but much of the fast moving story line, seems unneeded, an is only put there as an excuse to make a longer run time. At the end, even with its sometimes corny predictability, The Grinch is able to put everything together and make it work, even with a surprisingly sweet message upon its finish.
My Rating: 7.5/10"
299,"A magical tale of a Grinch and Whos.
Stunning story and visuals, how could you lose?
A story so timeless, yet so fresh, and so new.
A trip through the mind of Dr. You-Know-Who.
Illumination, you've done it once more,
and gave us the best iteration of Grinchy lore!
A stunning film for all ages just the same,
except for Chuck Jones', it renders all others lame.
Pharrell narrating and Cumberbatch in the lead,
this is the film we did not know we need.
We knew the Grinch hated Christmas.
The whole Christmas season,
and before this film, we did not know the reason.
While Jim Carey's version gave context to these tales,
it, by comparison, ultimately fails.
If you are a parent and need an hour or two,
I implore you, good people, to see this film of The Grinch
and Cindy-Lou Who.
Nine out of Ten is what I dare give this movie!
For in the last year, many other films weren't quite as groovey!"
300,"Was well animated and definitely had a few funny moments here and there. I loved what they did with Max. Tyler The Creator's version of the Grinch song was absolutely atrocious, like soooooo bad."
301,I do not like any of the versions of the grinch except the classic. It seems like they make a new one every year. This year though I have a two year old who saw the cover on apple tv and was interested... so I watched the trailer with her and I was hooked! This movie had me laughing out loud from the beginning to the end. It was fabulous! The facial expressions on the grinch and max were epic!The only thing I found odd... not really bothersome or anything... just a bit curious was that the score sounded an awful lot like the Harry Potter score.Great movie! I will likely watch this one every year! :)
302,"I found it to pay homage to the Warner bros days of old!
Is it super cheesy and ultra PG?
yes.
However I honestly enjoyed it!
The animation is on point as always, the script kept me involved and the characters a delight.
Illumination, you've pulled it off once again."
303,"First off.... the good.Animation was top notch and very ""cute"". Many great scenes just by the animation alone and the story was your typical Grinch story so that's not anything surprising.
The dog having been upgraded big time to more of a 2nd character instead of a door mat was a welcomed addition.The bad... many of the voices seemed very off, lacking personality.
The Grinch being the cutest character could be seen as a negative because I'm rooting for him more so than town of characters. I could have watched him go on his own adventure honestly with the dog.
The Narrator's voice is easily the biggest, and possibly most disgusting mistake in any animated movie I can think of besides Daisy in Secret Life of Pets. The voice should fit the tone of the movie and the narrator's lack of emphasis on any word EVER is extremely annoying and loses a few points just for that. I'd rather Keenan Thompson had done the narration instead of playing an actual character. He actually put some emotion in his character. You can't just READ a script. Boris Karloff blew this guy out of the water."
304,"The original animated television short of 1966 is one of the many classics that inspired all Christmas movies as we know them today, which means that remaking it to be a full length feature was both risky and unneeded. Thankfully, this new version manages to recapture the heartwarming feel of the original, even if the story has become incredibly generic and predictable after all these many years."
305,Great family Christmas movie with some good moments in it. I particularly enjoyed the Grinch's character more so than the live action one. His anti Christmas take is awesome especially if you hate the sugary sweet stuff like I do sometimes and his plan is well executed. Go see it if you get the chance but given that the new year is almost here might be best to catch it on the small screen next Xmas. Enjoy.
306,"Absolutely an Illumination production; the Minions can be felt from the story's exuberance right down to the character designs. But this is a Grinch movie, and he's not nearly as mean as he should be. Cumberbatch's main character is a green-hued Gru, and that's where it lost me a bit. Way too sweet. And then there's Kenan Thompson, stealing the whole movie.It's not bad, just unnecessary."
307,"If you've seen any of the several incarnations of this story, you've seen this one too. While the updated animation is nice to look at, there's not a whole lot else to this film. While I like him, Benedict Cumberbatch was an odd choice to voice the Grinch. The story is essentially the same as every other, and while it is a reliable story, this film might have benefited by changing it up a little given how many times we've seen it."
308,"This movie falls flat on so many levels. The movie meets all of the family check boxes, but does so without any soul. Truly made to make money. The most disappointing part of it all... They virtually removed all of Dr. Seuss' heart, flare, and style from this version."
309,"Honestly, it's boring. This well-known story is an opportunity for writers and animators to have serious fun doing multi-layered holiday-based humor that ends with an epic, baked-in heart-warming finale that we all know is coming. Sadly, they dropped the ball hard on this one. I *wanted* to like it, I really did, but extreme close-ups on wide-eyed cutesy (or emo) character models only get you so far.If they'd spent half the time they devoted to animating hair, fur and snow on clever writing, smooth editing and deeper character chemistries, this would have been an instant classic - a hilarious, hysterical but heart-warming and tear-jerking, family-bonding all-ages reminder that ""Christmas is within"" - at just the right time of year.This... this is a commercial sugar cookie of a movie. It's not great (or even good), but it's sweet and it's pretty, and it's seasonal.Bottom line: It's a good one-time way to distract little kids for 90-minutes. Nothing more."
310,"Sorry to be a grinch but this Movie should NEVER of been remade and felt entirely contrived just to make the production company money at Christmas time! Absolutely hard to watch and listen to except for Max the dog and frankly the voices just, well seemed really wrong for the characters. Save your money!"
311,Visual great film and storyline stay trued to the book but I have to say how disappointing it was on the grinch being nice and not that mean. Illumination needs to switch it up most of characters looked and talked straight out of Despicable Me.
312,"It is not often I actually write a review for a movie. So here goes., we went to the cinema as a family treat. At the half way point of the movie, my wife and I were clock watching, waiting for the torture to end. Actually no torture is a bit harsh. I would not say anything is really that bad with the movie, it just does not seem to work. Maybe it is because in a few weeks time if someone asks me about the movie I would have to think hard about which version of the Grinch it is."
313,"If you're familiar with the Dr Seuss children's classic ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"", you'll be familiar with this story as well. How can the Grinch ensure he gets some peace and quiet while Whoville celebrates? Why he's going to take matters into his own hands, of course! Along with his trusty dog Max, the Grinch plans to steal all the decorations and gifts from the entire town in one single night, and toss them off into an abyss. This re-imagining doesn't deviate too much from the original story but adds some subplots and characters to give it a bit more flavour. Animation wise, Illumination knows precisely how to make their characters visually endearing as evident by everyone's favourite Minions. They create a broad canvas by making Whoville larger-than-life, then filling it with a lot of tiny details and a splash of colour that gets you right into the spirit of Christmas. And that's really what this film is all about.There is a timely and relevant message on kindness and acceptance that's firmly rooted in the screenplay. This becomes evident towards the third act and gives the film more to look forward to than merely having a bad guy trying to burst everyone's happy bubble. Cindy Lou Who, voiced by Cameron Seely plays a crucial role in this aspect. Benedict Cumberbatch has a lot of campy fun voicing the Grinch, and he goes all out to embrace the grouchy and grumpy character. There's a slight menace to his take on this character, but Cumberbatch also adds some heart to the otherwise pessimistic persona, and that's when the movie pulls on your heartstrings just a little bit.As long as they can sit through the first two acts, this gives something for adults to look forward to. Otherwise, the interactions between the Grinch, his dog Max and a huge reindeer Fred lend to the most entertaining moments. Pharrell Williams as the narrator speaking in rhymes from the original book adds a nice touch that threads the film. While 'The Grinch' isn't exactly groundbreaking or fresh, it has just enough Christmas magic to justify another modern retelling of an old story"
314,It does everything it has to do and nothing else. I'm a bit let down that this movie is so forgettable... Reminds me of this year's Ocean's 8 with the same problems. These movies take 0 risks and therefore they have no identity. Just movies to enjoy in the moment and go next.My score: B+
315,"The animation of this movie is awesome, textures, shadows, lights, etc., but, the plot is very lame, this Grinch doesn't have charisma, and the other characters are simple filler.
""Illumination's The Grinch is just Despicable Me, but in Xmas""."
316,"As another user said, an unnecessary remake. The story recreation was a poor attempt and this is not even close to as good as the 2000 version of the story. Illumination knew they'd get an easy box office putting this out at Christmas anyway, but the story should have either stayed identical to the original with some added flare or gone a completely different direction. Instead it just kind of....exists. I have literally written one other review, if even that (I can't remember) but I was so underwhelmed by this film I took the time to put a review here so that should tell you something. The most original parts were I. The preview and instead of making the story magical like the original and Jim Carrey film this one just kind of makes it ordinary. Save your money and watch it streaming if you really want to see it. You're a boring one, Mr. Grinch."
317,"The story is a classic. The animation is good. Cumberbatch's performance was good. Pharrell Williams did a fine job of narrating. It was ruined by the choice of ""music"". Rap just doesn't go with this classic. I'll skip adding this to my collection."
318,"Innocent, sweet, and well Animated. The Dr. Seuss Classic lives its third life, and its second on the big screen in a well meaning film, that if it weren't for Illumination's trademark humor could be as timeless as the Chuck Jones cartoon, but despite some of that humor, the animation is fantastic and the vocal performances are well done. In the end ""The Grinch"" is a sweet and innocent feature that I wouldn't mind watching again."
319,I liked this adaptation except for the narration which would have been better by Brad Dourif as Pharrell Williams leaves much to be desired. This story is good but the Grinch is not supposed to find a reindeer.and that changes the way he becomes good from the original story. I like the animation and the way it was produced. The characters are fun except of course for the Grinch.
320,"The Grinch is probably Illumination's best movie as of 2018. And that's not because it's good, it's because it's not bad. Animation was fine, not a lot of potty humor, acting was believable. In had never seen the original Grinch (neither the Jim Carrey adaptation nor the cartoon) so I went into this with relatively low expectations, especially for an Illumination movie. After experiencing the actual Grinch story for myself however, I personally was not a fan of the message given to kids at the end, which taught them to assimilate rather than stop somthing they hate. In conclusion, it's great for kids who don't exactly get what they're watching too much, but I don't recommend it for older folk."
321,"Too many changes for me..... the grinch didn't even seem as mean as his predecessors. It's still a very good movie for the kids. It's just a watered down Grinch movie, intended for a new softer generation. My favorite Grinch movie would kick this Grinch movie's but..... literally !!!! I gave this movie a 6 rating which it's still not too bad. It's entertaining"
322,"It wasn't a bad adaptation of the Grinch story. I liked the few twists and additions to the story. It was definitely made for kids, though. I, personally, liked Jim Carey and Ron Howard's version better, but that one also had some more mature humor. My 4 year old daughter loved it, and the kids in the theater were all laughing at parts. Overall, a good innocent movie for the youngsters."
323,I laughed a lot and really enjoyed the animation! A little shorter than I expected but it was a nice version of the story. The Grinch wasn't as mean as he is known for but I guess that was something they were trying out. Enjoyable nevertheless.
324,"Illumination's The Grinch is the latest movie adaptation of the classic Dr. Seuss book ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"". It stars Benedict Cumberbatch as the titular character who really hates Christmas and Whoville's traditional ways of celebrating it. Because of this, he plots to infiltrate the town on Christmas Eve to steal away their Christmas joy.I grew up loving the original short by Chuck Jones and I ultimately find it to still be a masterpiece to this day. Although I was somewhat skeptical that we would be getting a Grinch movie not too long after getting the one with Jim Carrey. After watching it however, it's perfectly acceptable, but nothing memorable.There are certain qualities that kids and even some adults would like. For kids, there would be the animation, which can be pretty creative. Some of the jokes and gags were pretty funny. I also feel like they would like the Grinch character as well as Cindy Lou Who and her friends. I was also pretty surprised with the fact that the Grinch was offered some character depth. He feels more fleshed out when we see some flashbacks of him from when he was a kid. It gives him more of a motivation and a sense of believability for his actions, and I think the adults will appreciate that. Finally, I found the sideplot revolving around Cindy Lou to be very sweet, even if it might be a little forced.There is plenty to criticize however. One of the biggest flaws has to be its casting, especially with Cumberbatch as the Grinch. When I think of his voice, I think menacing. Boris Karloff and even Jim Carrey gave off great performances as him, and then you have the man playing Doctor Strange as the Grinch, who did not do him justice. There were also some scenes that felt more like fluff than anything. I can imagine that it would be hard to adapt the classic book, but there are some scenes that feel more like pointless filler. Being that the runtime is only 86 minutes, it feels like they do get stretched out. I don't wanna spoil certain scenes, but I will say that some of them were made to just build up to a cheap joke.The Grinch may be a fun ride for kids, but anyone outside of that group will probably find it average like myself. Despite some nice qualities, there is also plenty to criticize too. It will give kids something to enjoy and be quiet to while the parents most likely fall asleep.5/10"
325,"Dr. Seuss' The Grinch is an animated adaptation of Dr. Seuss' 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas'. The Grinch(Benedict Cumberbatch) hatches a sinister plan to steal Christmas, from the citizens of Whoville.Dr. Seuss' The Grinch is an awesome film. Directors Yarrow Cheney & Scott Mosier have given us an entertaining movie, that shows its protagonist in a more empathetic light that previous adaptations. The animation is fantastic. The ending will melt your heart. One flaw of this film is that, it is not as hilarious as so many other animated movies. The vocal performances of the cast, are the highlight of the film. Benedict Cumberbatch is spectacular as The Grinch. Cameron Seely is outstanding as Cindy-Lou Who. Rashida Jones is amazing as Donna Who. Pharrell Williams is superb as the Narrator. Tristan O'Hare is adorable as Groopert. Kenan Thompson is excellent as Mr. Bricklebaum. Dr. Seuss' The Grinch is not a must watch. However, it is worth watching with the full family, during Christmas season. Have a merry & Grinch-y Christmas!"
326,"The movie is cute, and the animated set-pieces are works of art, but the movie does little to make the Grinch truly 'Grinchy.' Sure, he's rude, grouchy, and hates Christmas; he feels more like a grouchy neighbour, rather than someone who truly hates the Whos.
It is a good take on the Grinch for young kids though."
327,"I must say if you have kids ( Young & Old ) Grand Kids, you must consider buying this Gem of a movie by Illumination for them.Stunning Visuals
Great sounds and MusicThree words describe this movie - Wonderful, Splendid, and Instant Classic come to mind.Buy as a Stocking Stuffer or secrete SantaThey will probably watch many many times.(: Merry Christmas All :)"
328,"The obvious banishment of the word Christmas is a set up for this okay but unnecessary remake with a varnishing of PC lacquer. The Grinch is far more mellow, a but grouchy but not scary and abusive like the original. He's just sad and lonely- though so was the original. He's a lot more hygienic. There's also a tired, single mom."
329,"This film is just an absolute shell of what the Grinch Who Stole Christmas was. It took everything that came before, and sanitized it, modernized it and filtered it through the most tepid pop culture imaginable. The narration is god awful, we went from Boris Karloff and Sir Anthony Hopkins to.... Pharrell Williams? He sounded like he was literally reading off a sheet of paper, he's a pop star not an actor, like most movies from this company they seem to want to shoehorn pop music and pop stars into their films regardless of detriment. Unlike the other two adaptations this one will become extremely dated due to the references and music used.Fact is this is epidemic amongst all the children's movies made by Illumination. They take everything that is purely creative and shove it right back into a conventional modern mundane setting where everything has to resemble everything around you because no one can trust children to have the intelligence to understand symbols, metaphors or satire. Everything has to be dumbed right down and dulled to an inoffensive hum to placate the lowest common denominator.As those are the over-arching issues I have with the film there are more minute but no less irritating quibbles as well. Firstly why do the Whos not know and fear the Grinch? Barely anyone even reacts to his presence. Last I checked the whole point was that the Grinch was like a scary story/legend told to Who children. The fact that they don't fear him or show indifference is blasphemy. As to the voice acting: I KNOW Benedict Cumberbatch can do a fantastic booming villainous voice, he did a great job as Smaug and he sounded great as Khan in Into Darkness. Yet who's decision was it to make the Grinch sound like a mildly annoyed hipster inconvenienced by people? Just off putting how he doesn't genuinely instil abject disdain and outright villainous terror upon the Whos. How do you come to a climax in your film if your character has such a short and mundane journey from mildly inconvenienced to acceptance? It should have been irredeemable miscreant to heart of gold... and that's really just part of the whole issue with this toothless affair. It's a movie that is comfortable with coasting on a brand and a story that everyone knows so they don't have to put anything on the line.Absolutely dreadful."
330,"This is the most underrated movie EVER!
It made me cry, smile, and laugh out loud. I am so heart broken to see the rating (6.3) and these awful reviews. This movie is teaching US showing love in the best way possible and how important it is and you all here doing the exact opposite.
If I watched it in a theatre you would have probably seen me clapping when it finishes. I highly recommend watching this movie with your kids, they will learn how showing love and caring about others make a huge difference on some peoples lives."
331,"It's much more mild, calm and childlike than the agressive Jim Carey version, which I honestly loathed. I do think it was lacking zip when he was stealing Xmas stuff, that was very clearly in the original story, and I preferred the townsfolk gathering around the tree to sing as in the original story. Making the grinch a bit meaner/spiteful would have pushed it up in enjoability for me. It was just a bit bland, like cheap marble cheddar compared to an aged better quality one lol. But it seems very safe for kids who might get overwhelmed by too much anger, and I like the fact that the grinch was very much a redeemable person by the end, my son always loved the grinch when he was very little, I think that reflects a child's abaility to see people openly and be forgiving, so kudos on that."
332,"Watched this last night with my fiancé (she fell asleep). It was pretty boring & not funny. I laughed like once or twice. They modernized the music which is fine, but I didn't really care for it. Animation was good, but overall I just wasn't entertained. Wouldn't recommend, definitely won't be added to list of Christmas movies to re-watch every December."
333,This was a weak-take on the Grinch story. Slightly different perspective told but fairly flat story. Opening scene was nice.
334,This movie is a cute take on the Grinch and has more of a Dr. Seuss feel to it. However nothing compares to the original with Jim Carrey.
335,"I really enjoyed this movie. I was reluctant to watch it with such low reviews, but after I saw that many reviewers seemed to love the original cartoon and didn't like that this version was a little different, I gave it a go. As a kid watching the original Grinch cartoon, I always thought he was too mean anyway. He's no angel in this version, but I enjoyed all the extra cuteness this version added (that is apparent from the commercials). The look and feel of this movie reminds me of Nightmare Before Christmas in a few of the parts, and the animation was eye candy for me. It's not as perfect of a movie as Nightmare Before Christmas is, but it is good."
336,"Regardless of your feelings towards the Jim Carey version, I think everyone can agree that this 2018 version isn't where it's at. The Grinch isn't very mean, he's just kind of like that middle school bully in every kids show that knocks your books out of your hand when he walks past you in the hallway. And no one in Whoville is even afraid of him, so why is he so bitter? Because he's an orphan. That's right, this game on the Grinch hates Christmas because he's an orphan. Yawn - give me a break. Also, why was the overworked single mom subplot necessary? Other than padding out the runtime, of course. Benarnold Cucumbersnatch sounded weirdly like Bill Hader most of the movie, and I hated Pharrell Williams narration. He sounded more like he was reading a story to a classroom full of kids than narrating a major motion picture. This movie also has *the* WORST rendition of ""You're a Mean One, Mr Grinch"" that I've ever heard. When The Grinch's heart grew three sizes, my attention span *shrunk* three sizes. This movie wasn't bad per se, just boring, bloated, and unneeded."
337,I really enjoyed this movie. It felt like they gave much love to produce this one. I was crying the whole ending part cause it was so beautiful. Thank you!
338,Forget about the narrator or the annoying neighbors. My biggest problem with this movie is that no one knows who the Grinch is. He walks around the whole town with no one even noticing him. Also who really thinks those annoying goat scenes were funny ?
339,"You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch is one of my favorite holiday songs and Pharrell's version is horrible, awful, stink, stank, stunk! I was so sad! I didn't particularly enjoy him as the narrator either. Cumberbatch's Grinch seemed to be lacking as well, maybe like a watered down version of the character? I did like the graphics, the expanded Cindy Lou character, as well as the storyline that gave more depth than the original, but overall, it just wasn't great.
P.S. I do love Fred the reindeer and the woodsman!"
340,"The grinch who stole this Christmas gave in quite quickly to the songs of the people. Nothing about the grinch stood out, his backstory was not original and he seemed to prefer to be home instead of showing hate for Christmas. The original was good because the character was unique but this one follows with the same amount of energy as a broom. Boring and unimpressive."
341,"So yes there was the Jim Carey one (which you may think is the original, but seems like Boris Karloff would like to disagree according to imdb at least), but if you watch them back to back and with any nostalgia excluded, you may feel like me ... and see this as the superior movie. Though I have not seen the Karloff one, so I'm not saying the ultimate Grinch.Having said, the Carey Grinch was live action and this is animated. So maybe you prefer one over the other anyway. If that is the case, I will not be able to tell you what's what anyway. But this does take things that I personally would consider ""flaws"" from the Carey adaptation and succeed in making them work (like the santa sleigh with the presents to name one). Very well animated and voice talent that deserves that name and then some. Great kids movie that grown ups can enjoy too"
342,"The movie didn't go by the book, or the original cartoon. It was abhorrent! Doctor Sues is probably rolling in his grave! All the humor in the movie was already portrayed in the trailer, so there was nothing new in the movie that was actually funny. Also, this movie made my precious baby sister stop believing in Santa, because of the scene where the Grinch says Santa Claus isn't real!!! I hate this movie with a passion for that reason.Yours truly,
A tempestuous big sister."
343,"I don't get all the horrible reviews of this movie. I find it very amusing and hilarious. Sure it doesn't follow the story to a t, but how can it it's originally a short story and I personally love that they made it different I'm so tired of seeing the same old stuff just remade over and over. That being said this movie doesn't feel like it's just a boring remake. I love the humor and feel like this movie should have a much better rating."
344,"Great movie to watch around Christmas time!
Don't know why so many people hated it. It was a great movie, beautifully animated, great story and lovely characters."
345,"This reimagined version of the Grinch is bland, uninteresting and a little boring. I like most of the actors here but they are all so pedestrian. Maybe it's the script..the narration was stale marshmallow fluff, the music was rehashed circa 1990 charity Christmas album garbage....stick with the original or the Jim Carrey remake, this one is uninspired mush."
346,"Almost nothing from the trailer is in this film, and it's better that way. Illumination Entertainment has a reputation for purely profit-oriented lowest common denominator fluff with no substance. The trailer gave me that impression but the film thankfully overcame that. It's engaging with a good message but the plot is a bit thin. Most of the characters and plot events are purely in service of some gags."
347,Very cute remake of a classic. Very nostalgic as well!
348,"A new take on a classic. the tale is different. im happy for that. they played with the relation of grinch to the town. focusing on cindy. as we all loved the carrey adaptation. it is so sweet and the town is so pretty. yes, it is not a musical. and i wish for the last score to come in. but its background as they built this new space that i felt warm in. not the best but not worth being arguable."
349,I really enjoyed this version of the grinch. Max was my favorite character and maybe I just bonded with him because he reminds me a lot of my own dog. The story got a little drawn out and slow in the middle but I really enjoyed the ending and shed a few tears when the Grinch gave Max a gift. Animation was beautiful. Not a perfect movie but good enough to put on every year while you decorate the tree.
350,We love this movie. It has become a tradition in our home.
351,"Let me start off by saying that I have not seen any of the other Grinch movies, nor have I read the book because it's not very well known in some non-English speaking countries. In fact, the only Grinch I have seen prior to this one was in Home Alone 2.I was very surprised to see so many negative reviews because I absolutely loved this film. I have a small child so I have seen this movie 3 times in the last week and I still enjoy it. The visuals are stunning, there some very funny moments and the message is simple, yet strong.I did shed a few tears, I laughed and I felt warm and fuzzy inside. I am sure I will watch this movie a fe wmore times before Christmas and I am looking forward to it!"
352,"I was worried about this as the Jim Carrey version was creepy. But this is lovely and funny and, most importantly, a huge hit with my 5 & 7 year olds."
353,"I feel like people are comparing the old movie to the newer version and hoping its the same. Im actually a huge fan of the change in storyline. I was skeptical at first, but I personally enjoyed the fact that people were not mean to the grinch and that he was just lonely. I will always love the old movie but I really do enjoy this version too. Give it a shot with an open mind"
354,The animation was good. The story was not true to the pom and what is worse they rewrote the poem. How can they put Dr. Seuss' name in the title??? And the voices were terrible! They did not fit the characters at all! Did not nearly capture the heart of the original or the book. Inspired no real feeling at all unlike the original which makes me cry every year since it came out. Take a pass and watch the original cartoon.
355,Story feels like it lost its direction 3-4 times throughout the movie. Voice acting is not that great either. but it is funny at points.
356,"Animation, lighting and textures are absolutely incredible!!! ... But why would you remake this classic story without the comedy?!? It's a shame when u see how much creativity and work would have went into creating the visual side of this movie. This is just a normal everyday tale."
357,"Title says it all. The grinch is not scary at all, nor does he embody what the grinch is supposed to be. Instead of an evil, Christmas hating outcast, he comes off as a harmless, mischievous, annoying little b****. Horrible choice casting Cumberbatch.If you want to show your kids the grinch, show them the Jim Carrey version.If you're looking for nostalgia as an adult, this ain't it chief."
358,Save your time and money and watch the original. Bad film with little redeeming qualities.
359,"If you've seen the trailer you've seen the whole movie. It's funny, yes, but the trailer ruins it as it has included every single joke from the movie."
360,It was quite similar to the original and maybe was unnecessary to make but still I enjoyed it nether the less.
361,"Fun Christmas movie. A definite family movie. Adds a few new things to the grinch storyline and it works surprisingly well. The visuals were great and there were a lot of chuckles to be had. The whole opening sequence is the best part of the movie in my opinion. More for kids than adults but still adult friendly.. It is entertaining. It wasn't as as good as the Jim Carrey/ Ron Howard adaptation but this one is also animated mind you, so you may like this one better for that reason alone. Like the Jim Carrey movie, the dog in this was very funny and made for a lot of the laughs. You know what? Just go watch the movie and feel the Christmas spirit. That's what these movies are for right? 7.25/10"
362,And this film proves it. How many of these sugary cgi's can they rattle out each month. I'm sure it's technical wizardry at its peak but Grinch is far too nice in this film which ruins the whole character.
363,I watched the older movie 2 years ago. This one came as a kind of disappointment. The animation was better in the earlier movie. And it had the inimitable Jim Carey. I think they shouldn't have remade this movie so soon. I was actually bored watching this version.
364,"The Chuck Jones Cartoon from 1966 is an instant classic, it may be slightly dated but with it's timeless feel, great narration, captures the book quite well and great animation, it's a great example of a Christmas classic that dosen't try to ruin the book but tries to tell it from a visual stand point, so I really like it, the Ron Howard Movie however is just okay, granted Jim Carrey is somewhat annoying, the visuals can be generic, the Whos look creepy and it's references along with some toilet jokes are really unpleasant, but Jim Carrey is fun, the Grinch make up is amazing and it does have a Christmas look to it along with James Horner's amazing score, so when I heard Illumination is making another one, i kept my expectations low, i thought it might turn out to be just like the Ron Howard, even though I have some high hopes for it, so it got released on the ninth of November and I saw the movie yesterday and....... I was surprised by it, properly the best Dr. Seuss movie so far so let's talk about it.The plot is... well... you know the drill, Grinch hates Christmas, wants to steal it so the whos down in Whoville won't celebrate it and annoy him anymore, pretty much what you expect from this sort of story, but what this movie does better then the Ron Howard Movie is that it doesn't try to be a complicated and long movie, it tries to capture what made the special so spectacular, short, simple, have the spirit and message still present, even though it has bits of the book, but mostly keep it different from the book and at the same time actually has funny moment unlike the last movie, granted it can have it's toilet and gross humour that is expected, but it's has about 80% humour that works while the other 20% doesn't, so it's mostly good, at the same time trying to expand the Grinch's backstory which makes a little more sense here, so I'm happy for that, the subplot about Cindy Lou-Who trying to capture Santa so she can talk to her and also try and do something for her mother is interesting, however the writing is not perfect since it's very predicable, also as I mentioned the humour is not quite comedy gold and Cindy's subplot is somewhat pointless, but that doesn't make the movie unbearable, in fact it's easier to get into then the other one, so good job film makers.The animation is exactly what I needed this Christmas, it's such a nice looking movie of course coming from Illumination who always put effort in their animation, so this one is another nice looking movie, the backgrounds look nice, it is also very colourful to look like that helps makes this movie feel even more Christmasy, the character designs are creative and each character is easily identified by their looks, the Grinch looks even better then Jim Carrey and looks even more cleaner and close to resembling the Chuck Jones Grinch, the Whos looks great especially Cindy, the execution of the comedy and the chase scenes also have a lot of energy, so as much as the animation works and I think it's one of the better looking animated films of the year, it can also look a bit generic, not much stands out so it's not a completely perfect looking film, but with that said, it's still Illumination and all of their animation in every movie is pretty solid, well expect Hop..., so the animation here is still one that captures the look of Christmas.The characters are likeable.... it's all I got for that one, but with the Grinch, he is much more relatable and easier to like and get entertainment by him, I really liked him here, he does learn he's lesson in the end of course, but you do see where he's coming from and easily likeable, the one from Howard's movie was hard to take serious, this one was much better, Max was also really enjoyable as well, arguably funnier then the Grinch, Cindy Lou-Who actually has a better purpose and is charming and cute, the rest of the characters like Fred, Cindy's Mother, Mr. Brickbalum and the rest of the people of Whoville have their moments of comedy and heart, but really the Grinch, Max and Cindy have a lot more character and personality then the others, the voice acting is pretty good for the most part, Benedict Cumberbatch does an excellent Grinch impression, a lot better then Carrey, Kenan Thompson is a lot of fun, Cameron Seely is charming and Rashida Jones is great, granted Pharrell Williams is fine here but is such a obvious choice for the narrator, but Hopkins did it better in my opinion, while not deep or complex character or even top notch voicing, the characters are likeable and the voice acting is mostly good, it makes the character a lot more enjoyable and charming.So yeah I liked this movie..... it's not Illumination's best film, but it's a lot better then the Lorax, Cat In the Hat and especially the Ron Howard Grinch Movie, But it's not as masterful as the Chuck Jones short, granted the humour can be cheap with it's highly predicable plot, a mostly average looking movie, characters who are basically stereotypes with a weird choice of narrator, but thanks to the plot that keeps the sprint, simplicity and heart of the special, wonderful animation and a lot of charming characters with good voice acting, it makes this movie a surprisingly legit good family film, I mean Smallfoot is much better then this, but I will take this over the other Dr. Seuss movies any day, so I do recommend this as a nice family film to watch, a whole lot better then the awful Nutcracker and the Four Realms Movie from Disney..... bleh....I will give the Grinch a 7.9/10."
365,""" . . . he just stole our stuff,"" proclaim the victims of perhaps Universal Movie Studio's scariest monster yet, THE GRINCH. Universal has long recognized that Ecclesiastical Ogres in general--such as THE MUMMY, and the Egyptian priests manipulating him--and Roman despoilers in particular, including THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, are especially threatening because they ring so true to Real Life. As Hollywood's pre-eminent House of Horror, Universal pulls out all the stops for THE GRINCH, giving him the same sort of cavernous hide-out, massive pipe organ, and self-pitying misanthropy displayed nearly a century ago by its PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. However, a screaming Lamb gets in the last syllable of THE GRINCH. This is appropriate, since the Lamb of God would no doubt react more violently to most any opulent modern-day Temple than He did to His birth ""den of vipers"" in Jerusalem. Universal must be commended for taking on Organized Gloating during the Holiday Season with this horror offering for all ages, THE GRINCH."
366,"I love the original cartoon movie. I hated the Jim Carey version, although I really like Mr. Carey. This version was so awful, it was cringe worthy and painful to watch. My kids were even cringing and laughing at how bad it was. The narrator was so bad. The remix of the Grinch song was SO BAD. It hurt my heart and ears to hear it butchered so badly! My kids were really disappointed with it, as well.
Cumberbatch's chosen voice was whiny and not well directed. He should have used his deep British voice with some well placed anger and spite. They changed the point of the movie, the tone and mood. They changed the Who people/culture and went so far away from the original story. I am surprised that whomever holds the Dr Suess estate allowed this to be produced. The voice acting was poorly done for most of the film. Don't waste your time. This was so bad I finally broke down and started my IMDb account to warn others, seriously.
The animation was well done, the hair and snow was great. For the producers of this show: it is SUPPOSED TO RHYME. Read a Seuss book sometime for your source material. It all rhymes, guys."
367,"Why take a classic and ruin it! Just a pathetic attempt, and so wrong. Truly horrible."
368,"I didn't think I would, but I liked this version of The Grinch so much more than the 2000 Jim Carrey version of the story. The Grinch's loneliness is played so much more prominently, and I feel for him as well as Cindy-Lou Who. It's a much better take on the story, and in my opinion it's the best take since Karloff's voice."
369,"So it is a totally relatable nice movie with an animated touch! I remember when I saw the live version of this Grinch and I was kind of scared of him. This grinch is cute! I mean, he is mean and stinks? But that he needs to go down to the town in need of food, just because he had some foodie depressing/stressing days? Relatable!I don't remember if Cindy wished for anything in the live movie, but I just appreciate that she lay an wishe for her mom, that she sees her mom and want to help her; then that Cindy never is home and ACTUALLY helps her, that is an another phenomen that happens in real life.It's cute, goofy and I just love it! Was it needed? Yeah! Now I can see grinch for a nice guy, then a scary hairy guy who lives far off in the mountain... I was creeped out of the old version, but it has it charms."
370,"Ruined by a very poor lead voice choice. Cumberbatch sounds like a character from an old Scooby Doo cartoon. Was Jeremy Irons not available for the Grinch's voice? A lot of the magic of the original TV special was Boris Karloff's menacing voice. Then terrible, out of place hip-hop music and a poor choice of narrators rounds out my list of misses. This could have been a classic with just a few critical changes."
371,"Full of funny humor, amusement for adults and kids. The animation is fantastic, just look at how those body movements and facial expressions portray everything a real actor would aim for. And the voices! Voice acting isn't as easy as it sounds, and most don't do it well at all, which is why cartoons are often overlooked in entertainment. So why the under 7 rating here at imdb? I dunno... maybe because more and more parents don't even CARE to take their kids to the movies, so most kids (and parents) didn't even see this. They slap a tablet in their hands to shut them up because it is just what we do now, right?The new pacifier.Anyway, you should watch this. Even if you don't have kids. I did."
372,"This cartoon is full of adult-appropriate humor, whlile being 100% child friendly. It is beautifully made and very well narrated. Highly recommend to see it with kids and then once again, after the kids fall asleep :)"
373,"This is undoubtedly the best Grinch movie so far. I begin by saying that the funny moments are very spectacular and very funny, whether by references to viral videos from YouTube or to other stories by D. Seuss; Also I can say that the animation of the film is 100% perfect; The casting was also very good; The plot of the film is very good and the moral of the film is also perfect. The characters are also very good and the songs are beautiful. Highly recommend."
374,"Regardless of what other people say you have to watch this movie. The animations are spot on the whole time and you cannot help but laugh almost the whole time. The people of the town are just so funny, especially the guy who claims to be the grinches best friend and the actions of the little girl. You never get bored of the movie while your watching it and it just has such a satisfying happy ending that makes you want to go watch it again."
375,"I cannot remember a likeable character that stuck out to me. The only character I liked was the black guy with the beard as he served as a good comic relief character who almost always had a funny line to say. The Grinch has a backstory that seemed interesting but that potential was thrown out the window since they didn't develop much about how he became an orphan and why he was an underdog. In short, it was shallow and cliched. Max is a little annoying as the stubborn dog. The mischievous but well-meaning Cindy Lou was a mediocre character. I haven't seen the old cartoon or the Jim carrey one but I know she plays a more major role in both this one and the Jim Carrey one but her side story with trying to trap Santa did nothing for the story. The only thing she did for the story was help the Grinch redeem himself. She could've had a more smaller role. This thing with her wanting Santa to help her struggling mother was forgettable and sappy. So on the topic of the human characters, none of them were that well-written, the only well-written aspect one of them had was in the form of a little girl who helped the Grinch redeem herself but that isn't saying much, that doesn't mean she's a tightly-written character since she has such a major role but rarely does anything for the plot.The voice acting was okay but it's nothing fantastic. It seemed a bit flat, they didn't really give fresh life to the characters. The animation was also okay, it was a little bit too silly. But I think the worst part is the designs, Illumination likes to put Despicable Me footprints in their movies instead of giving them a sort of uniqueness that sets them apart from other films. Like with Disney, their animation may seem familiar and you know they're Disney-esque but does Ariel remind you of Cinderella in personality and design? I can see pink tomboyish Edith in Cindy Lou, they need to start making more unique characters and designs instead of lazily taking the designs from their other films.I haven't seen the Lorax but maybe it's for the best if Illumination can leave Dr. Seuss works alone since both this and the Lorax are mediocre films. If they decide to do another Dr. Seuss movie, they need to focus on giving more substance to the characters and give them a purpose that connects with the main plot and a cast of distinctive characters so that they wouldn't end up so average like the Grinch."
376,Super cute movie! Love the twists in the plot. Fred is my favorite character!
377,I adored this movie and so did the kids! I had a big goofy grin on my face almost the entire time. This movie was very well done and heart warming!
378,"Previously, Dr. Seuss' book ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" was filmed in drawn animation by Chuck Jones with Boris Karloff voicing the title character as well as narrating and in live action by Ron Howard with Jim Carrey playing that same character. Now, Benedict Cumberbatch voices him in computer animation by Illumination Entertainment, makers of the Despicable Me movies. It admirably changes some things and adds some other characters in expanding the story. Chuck Jones' version is still the definitive one and the Howard/Carrey version has some good moments but this current version does make this Grinch a little more sympathetic even before his transformation. In summary, me and my movie theatre-working friend really enjoyed The Grinch."
379,Poor overall. The funniest bits are all in the trailer. Got really bored after about 45 mins and wanted to walk out but my 6 year old seemed to enjoy it.
380,"First of all, the only really good thing about this movie was the animation. The animation in this movie was pretty good to look at. You can easily see that the animators put a lot of effort into how the movie looked. The pacing was pretty decent seeing how it's a kids movie. The pacing in the film felt around the same speed throughout the film and was easy to follow. Benedict Cumberbatch was ok as the Grinch. I'm not sure if it was his fault or the dialogue in the film because the dialogue was cringy. There was so much forced humour in the film but seeing how this film is a kids film that is understandable. Now like I said before the pacing in the film is decent just not great. The book is sixty-nine pages long and they expanded it to a two hour and twenty-six-minute long movie so at some parts it seems to drag on. In my opinion, the last half of this film is better than the first and by that I mean the last twenty or so minutes. There is a subplot in this movie that really doesn't go anywhere so they could of just taken it out of the movie and probably make the movie a tiny bit better. The music in this film, which is scored by Danny Elfman, was actually pretty good but the the cover of the classic song wasn't. At least this movie has a good message for people to follow that Christmas is about family and friends and not the gifts under a tree. In the end. The Grinch is a nice movie for kids but is an unnecessary film. If you want to see a good Grinch movie watch the 1966 one."
381,"I should begin with the disclaimer that I am a Cumberbatch fan. I find his range impressive and his willingness to delve into character refreshing. Which is why his portrayal of the Grinch is so disappointing. I'm sure the producers of The Grinch selected Cumberbatch for his rich baritone voice that can sound simultaneously resonant and malevolent. Unfortunately, what we get instead is a sterilized cartoon with a sinus infection. This Grinch is neither sinister nor sympathetic. He is not enough of a curmudgeon to appreciate his transformation in the end, nor is he engaging enough to root for. I spent more time concerned about Max's well-being than worried about the Grinch -- or the Whos.I respect Cumberbatch's decision not to try and compete with or impersonate Boris Karloff's depiction. But honestly, that's how most of us think of the Grinch. He is dark, cantankerous, and frightening, but because he demands our attention we care about his resolution. We want Karloff's Grinch to repent because his characterization is rich and poignant. Unfortunately, this Grinch just doesn't impose the same respect or demands on our attention. He is flat and his denouement unfulfilling. I found myself wishing he'd just stay up on that mountain for the sake of all involved.The good news is, there's nothing offensive in The Grinch. It is certainly not the garish 2000 Jim Carrey version that was nothing short of a visual headache. The animation is clean, the characters are bright, the story is safe. In a word, it is sterile.
Pharrell Williams is a respectable choice for narrator, but he too plays it safe and boring. The same for Tyler, the Creator who wrote the main score. It isn't offensive, but it certainly isn't fun or memorable.I won't say The Grinch was a waste of time. My daughter liked it. There are plenty of fun laughs for the kids and it's worth a family outing. I just know what COULD have happened with this Grinch given the talent involved. Take your kids and have a good time, but don't expect much."
382,"Grinch is not really well made animated movie. It has many flaws and it is sometimes boring, but it has that ""feel good"" vibe, specially towards the end so I can't say I regret going to cinema to see it.
Ps. Im adult, im sure this is great for kids"
383,This Grinch who stole my money. I'll watch the classic and Carrey's version. Thanks. Did we really need this? Cash grab for this generation of kids. Seuss is rolling in his grave.
384,"Listen, Christmas is the one time of year where I'll completely go in for sappy, heart-felt films that appeal to our inner child and better nature. But... This film is utter garbage. Watered down, it's like someone saw the original Grinch once and then decided to make it a longer screenplay... after they suffered severe brain trauma and spent 10 years in a coma and forgot the best moments of the OG.There was so little character development to this Grinch... He was never diabolical, creepy, or malicious, he was just sad and lonely but really deep down a pretty nice guy who, with the exception of not letting his dog sleep in the bed with him, just needed some friends. He didn't transform with realization when his plan was foiled, it was more like his heart grew... I dunno, maybe 10% instead of three-sizes that fateful day.The changes in Cindy Loo-Who and her motivations weren't bad at all and could have made for a solid approach in the hands of a better writer, and even could have made this film watchable, but the butchering of the Grinch himself is flat-out unforgivable. Worst of all, though, were the lack of the traditional Grinch song (save for a remix that sorta maybe kinda paid tribute to it) and some of the most memorable lines from the classic book. ""It came without packages, boxes and bags?"" Not in this version!"
385,"Ultimately forgettable. Not even casually entertaining unless you are under the age of seven. Even then, not worth watching when you can just watch the original cartoon or the live action starring Jim Carrey."
386,I have loved the original Grinch forever. This one is amazing. The visuals and writing are over the top. Saw it with our grandkids. Absolutely completed my Christmas!!
387,"Incredibly boring! Struggled to stay awake. Some movies just don't need to be remade. Jim Carey was a much funnier entertaining Grinch.My 7 year old son said it was okay.Would of preferred to watch on dvd and saved some money going to the movies, not worth it!"
388,"I think my header says it all there..1966: a classic
2000: I'm sorry but terrible, hideous and childishly un funny.
2018: really great cgi, great jokes and humour (well at least some of it) and it almost stayed true to the original.
I definatley recommend giving it a watch at the cinema this festive season, but if your looking for a real festive classic then I'd say watch the 1966 cartoon.
But whatever you do avoid the 2000 movie at all costs."
389,"The movie lacked the Dr. Seuss magic. They replaced the nonsense rhymes like ""Pop guns, pampoogas, pantookas, and drums! Checkerboards, bizilbigs, popcorn, and plums"" with ""Gadgets and gizmos and dolls with strange names! Goofballs and shloopballs and video games!"" (WHY?) - They took away all the ""jingtinglers"", ""loofloovers"", ""tartookas"", ""whohoopers"", ""gardookas"", ""trumtookas"", ""slooslunkas"", ""blumbloopas"", ""whowonkas"", ""zoozittacarzay"", ""galooks"", and ""their great big electro whocarnio flooks"". They updated those with a tube sled, a green big wheel, and waffles. No, not even green eggs where allowed. I'd have to guess that Directors Yarrow Cheney and Scott Mosier along with writers Michael LeSieur and Tommy Swerdlow are either lazy or seriously lack any imagination. They were so focused on creating a more politically correct Grinch (that like most PC reworks) it lost heart. Kids fell asleep, some left early, I don't know if anyone was entertained by this garbage because of all the crying in the front rows.The soundtrack had some trash lyrics and sound attached to it. Tyler, The Creator was all over this with ""I'm A Grinch"" and for ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"" that basically sounds like a bad parody of the original. There was a great song called Happy by Pharrel Williams that the kids liked, but Tyler's monotone voice and complete lack of singing ability probably would have fit right in with an episode of 'The Simpsons' back in the 80's. It's just sad that someone would take a classic story like 'The Grinch' and turn it into this heartless mirror of today's society. Kenan Thompson was the voice of a new character named ""Mr. Bricklebaum"", a happy unbothered man that the Grinch laughs about because Mr. Bricklebaum believes he and the Grinch are friends. I seriously doubt that many children in the audience would see the new character as an African-American man. If you assume Bricklebaum is African-American, and remember that his love & kindness throughout the Grinch's life couldn't change the Grinch, but a little white girl's good nature did - it makes you think. They changed all the bad things of the original Grinch; such as being cruel to his dog Max - Yet the Grinch laughed behind the back of a black guy?"
390,"I had high expectations for this movie but came out very disappointed. The Grinch was not funny. Max (the dog) and the Goat are probably the best thing about the movie. Other than that, it's the same story that didn't need to be told. Save your money and wait for it on Netflix."
391,"Well a lot of the audience must have known the story line before hand . Still the efforts made by ILLUMINATION studios is worth applauding to . You do not expect to critically acclaim this movie,but the visual details is what makes it worth watching .The characters have really been perfectly reproduced and their presentation keeps things alive, making screenplay look lovely .From the eyes of a child the film should be rated 7/10 to 8/10 nevertheless an adult would call for 5/10 .The screenplay is a bit rushed pacing the last 25 minutes of the run time .
P.S - We have not seen much promising animated films on 2018 after Incredibles 2 and The Isel of dogs . This movie will be on the 3rd of my list to look out for in 2018."
392,This is by far the worst christmas movie ever made. Go watch the real grinch movie instead!
393,"There are lots of negative reviews on this film from adults. I sat and watched this with my 5yo son. The film animation is lovely the colour palatte is on point and it's a real easy to watch. It's not too long so my son and assume younger ones won't get bored.Some adults seem to be looking for a masterpiece, this is what it is an nicely done Christmas warm feeling film. I enjoyed it myself and my son loved it so I'd watch and look at it for what it is"
394,"I love Christmas its my favourite time of the year nothing can beat Christmas for me and everytime i watch this whether its in july or well right now it just makes me so happy and puts me in a Christmasy mood.
I really don't understand the 6.3 rating im guessing people are just dead miserable and bit of a bah humbug to enjoy such a beautiful film."
395,"This is a lovely Christmas animated remake of The Grinch. I enjoyed the movie, but something felt wrong. I don't know what it was, but it's left me with a weird feeling. I still recommend it to anyone during the Christmas season, especially since it's on Netflix now."
396,Why yall hating on grinch this movie is superior i watched it like 100 times. Its soo funny and it deserved more than 6.3 rating. Literally such an awasome and great movie!!!
397,"I thought it was a great new twist. Funny and modern, my son loves it, and it isn't it for kids anyway?! If he gives it a 10, I give it a 10."
398,"The worst part of this movie is the mumbling moron narrator, Pharrell Williams, he even mumbles an unpleasant repugnant version of the Grinch Song. I was going to quit watching this movie within the first few minutes solely because of Pharrell Williams noise vomit. The casting idiot who suggested hiring Pharrell should be ignored if they submit future anti-value choices this awful.Honestly, if you subtract the Grinch entirely, this would be a great Christmas movie. The secondary characters have lives of their own and motivations separate from The Grinch. The writers did a great job in that respect, it means movies can be appreciated deeper in rewatching. The animation is top notch and we'll thought out. The voices are superbly recorded and believable.
If only they didn't include Pharrell Williams sucking the life from the movie with none of Boris Karloff's gravitas or wit. This is a good direction aside from the vomit factor of Pharrell's lousy voicework (reminds me of the ultra-cringe of the Live Action Seuss flicks)."
399,"The writing and the characters were awful and had no depth. This movie had very little heart unlike the other adaptions. It is very slow paced. There was nothing unique about it that made it stand out among the others and even just rating it on its own without comparing it, the movie was terrible. I didn't have high hopes for this movie to begin with, so that makes it even worse that it was worse than I expected. I expected it to be a lot better story wise and for the characters to have depth. I was expecting a decent movie at least."
400,"Good watch, will watch again, and can recommend.This is probably the best physical representation of the Grinch, Max, and the Who's down in Whoville. While Benedict Cumberbatch does a fine job, I miss the personality representation of Jim Carey, or possibly Neil Patrick Harris (Lemony Snicket's: Count Olaf) could land that fine line of crazy, mean, but still funny. And it's not that Cumberbatch isn't funny, it's just most of the Grinch humor is done in the CG work.The movie is beautifully upgraded, but still contains the whimsy of the original aesthetic appeal. I feel Illumination was trying to mimic video game re-releases where you trick the audience by giving them what they remember, not what they had.The best thing about this is the lack of problems: it's a smooth, palatable watch and is interesting enough to rewatch without getting bored, but complex enough to still be stimulating."
401,"I rarely watch animated movies, so I didn't expect much going into this one. I have to say I like the original and Jim Carrey ones better, but this is still fun. For a family movie, or just a movie to go see with a friend or girlfriend, I think this is a good flick to see going into the holidays! 7/10"
402,"This movie is a remake of an obviously classic story. I say remake because there isn't a new spin or anything. It is a slightly different experience as it is modernized, both the content and how it was made. There's modern technology in the movie and a modernized soundtrack and the animation is up to today's standards. Other than that and obviously a little different imagination, it is still 'The Grinch'. At times I found my mind wandering, but there were enough cute, funny, or heartwarming moments to keep me engaged the rest of the time. The way they made the scenery wasn't particularly beautiful or anything. The designing overall felt kinda meh, but I liked the characters and all of the plot elements. Towards the end the movie gets really engaging because of the emotional story/lesson unlike the beginning parts where only sometimes it was engaging. Overall, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. It was good enough to be worth a watch though. I'm all for new remakes of The Grinch to keep coming out, because it is one of those stories that's nice to see every year and it's cool to have several different or even new versions to watch each time."
403,"I'm writing this review because I was AMAZED by one aspect. The story, animation, Gags, overall tone, etc were serviceable and appropriate for a kid's Christmas story. However, what immediately, dear I say, shocked me in a pleasant way was that they actually used a traditional Christmas Carol that highlighted the true meaning of the season and as a major set piece to boot.In today's overly politically correct and nontraditional climate, where true meanings of things are either watered down or outright ridiculed as not to ""offend"" the ridiculously sensitive, it was genuinely refreshing that a literal biblical Christmas Carol that announces Jesus coming ""to save us all from Satan's power when we had gone already"" in God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen was front and center. That this was used as a brief, but focused, musical number was even more amazing to me and it reminded me of the reading of the Nativity account in Luke by Linus in A Charlie Brown Christmas. The message was clear and unmistakeable. I applaud this choice and wonder if there were committed Christians who worked on this movie.In today's society, this kind of scene would generally change the words of such a hymn to make it gender neutral and completely remove the overt biblical message of salvation and redemption, or to ridicule it in some manner, but that did not happen. Rather, the message rang true and clear.For this alone, I roundly applaud this production! If only Hollyweird would continue this approach. I won't hold my breath."
404,"I have always been a big supporter of the wonderful world of Dr Seuss with his nonsensical stories and interesting characters. Having read How The Grinch Stole Christmas perhaps twice in my life, I am very unsure of the plot of the book itself however, I found this animation version quite satisfying to watch.To start, the CGI effects and animation was beautifully done. The colours were bright and bountiful as were the characters, however, I still maintain that Jim Carrey would have done a fantastic job lending his voice to one of his most notable roles as the Grinch but I believe that Benedict Cumberbatch did a great job nonetheless.Other noteworthy actors are Pharrell Williams as the narrator and Kenan Thompson as Mr. Bricklebaum. The soft, crispy tone of Williams' voice brought a soothing sense to the narration which probably resonated well with the children in the movie theater. In contrast, Kenan Thompson's notable voice brought a sense of wonder and excitement to the storyline as well as his character Mr. Bricklebaum which made him very enjoyable.However, I quite enjoyed Anthony Hopkins as the narrator in the live-action version of How The Grinch Stole Christmas because he told the story with flare and easily manipulated his voice to enhance the various dramatic events that took place.I suppose comparing the two is probably not a good idea so my overall experience of Dr Seuss's The Grinch was good. I enjoyed the different twist on a lovable children's story and found the film quite enjoyable."
405,"I sat down to watch the 2018 animated movie ""The Grinch"" with my 9 year old son, but I must admit that I wasn't really expecting much from this animated movie. So it turned out that I was positively surprised, because it actually turned out to be good.The storyline is straightforward, and pretty much a new rendering of the classic tale of how the Grinch stole Christmas. But it was actually enjoyable to see a new twist to it.And it definitely helped that the animation and CGI was quite spectacular, and the level of details and textures was just phenomenal, and it really helped bring the animated movie to life on the screen.Furthermore, the impressive cast list also helped bring the characters to life on the screen in a very convincing manner.""The Grinch"" is definitely an animated movie that it well-worth sitting down to watch with the family for the Christmas holidays. But it is also an animated movie that can be watched while it is not the Christmas holidays.I am rating ""The Grinch"" six out of ten stars."
406,"What a fun movie this could have been if I hadn't already seen it twice before. The animation is different, computer generated rather than drawn or live action. The voice acting isn't real impressive either, none of them really drawing me in.This Grinch just fails to do anything to really put itself ahead of the other two or even separate itself from them. It's not bad, it's just entirely unnecessary."
407,"The Grinch (Benedict Cumberbatch) hates Christmas. To his horror, he has emotionally eaten all the food and is forced to go into Whoville during the Christmas season. It doesn't go well and he comes up with the idea to ruin Christmas by impersonating Santa Claus. Meanwhile, Cindy Lou Who needs to talk to Santa about her wish. She recruits her friends to catch Santa.The 1966 special is perfect. This movie tries to improve on it by expanding on the story. It's a fool's errand. It could never improve on perfection. I actually don't mind the expansion in general. There are two big no-nos. The Whos look way too human and where are their antennas? They're just people with tiny noses. If the Whos are humans, then make Grinch a human and make this a live action movie. I wouldn't recommend it but at least, that could be interesting. This movie tries to be too modern. It needs to get rid of the electronics. The Whos exist in a specific world and the closer it gets to the modern world, the worst the visual content gets. The Whos have a certain style. At some point, it's no longer Dr. Seuss. At least, it's short. As for the voice work, the original had the greatness of Boris Karloff and the iconic song with Thurl Ravenscroft. These are iconic voices like Darth Vader. It doesn't get better than the best. Now it can be argued that Karloff was not the Grinch but rather the narrator reading the Grinch's dialogue. He's still the voice of the Grinch to me and Cumberbatch is doing something less compelling. I can see how the voice fits the character but it comes off weakly. Cindy Lou Who is older which is fine but the Whos sound too modern. They lack the wide eyed innocence that is inherent in their world. Nobody is evil but there is a stress in some of them especially the mom. Finally, there is the Grinch underwear. I get the joke but I'm conflicted about the results. Overall, this is an impossible job. Unless the filmmaker is willing to take unhealthy risks, it could never achieve much more than this movie. It's fine but this will be soon forgotten."
408,"Some will love this, some will not. I thought it was just okay, nothing special. Pretty and colorful animation that didn't quite reflect the colors of the 60s Grinch. The Grinch was in no way scary...no growly voice, no yellow teeth. Cindy-Lou Who was not a sweet demure tiny girl, but was presented as more of an outspoken tomboy. The story was made more generic...there was no real pulling of the heartstrings as in the original. The biggest annoyance of the movie for me was the remake of a couple of the songs...mainly 'You're a Mean One Mr. Grinch. It was really, really bad and unnecessary to boot. The narrator's voice left a lot to be desired...again, very generic and just didn't convey any trace of ambience. Vincent Price was perfect in the original...guess they knew they couldn't come close to that, so they clearly didn't try. If it weren't for the artistic aspects of the animation, I would have given this movie much less than a 6."
409,"I've watched a number of Grinch movies, they each have a place in my heart. This one did not disappoint, some things were different yet did not detract from the story at all! It was funny, well written and done! Must say I'm rather disappointed that it received such a low overall rating. Oh well, my rating means much more to me. This Grinch is one that'll be on my watch list each Christmas!"
410,"I'm very hard to please and this makes me the harshest critic out there. I haven't liked a single movie that's come out in the last 10 years. Traditional kids movies have especially become absolute trash and I won't allow my kids to watch them unless they came out before 2000, pretty much. I had an Anton Ego moment from ""Ratatouille"" with this one. This is actually a pretty gosh darn cute movie. It included traditional Christmas music, which I liked. It took many familiar wonderful elements from the cartoon. (I can't compare it to the a Jim Carrey version except to say this must be 100x better, because I only saw that version once and don't remember it.) It basically was the original cartoon, but it expanded on the Grinch's background and his ultimate redemption. It also gave more life to all of the characters in Whoville. I appreciate the movie didn't include vulgar humor. Again, all around great movie. The ONLY thing I didn't like was the inclusion of a couple rap/hip hop songs on the soundtrack. Just not my speed. Rap always sounds angry. I hope this was helpful to anyone reading. I thought it was cute and definitely recommend it."
411,"First off, this movie is not about THE Grinch. It is about a man named Grinch who is sad and lonely. His heart never grows in size because it was never smaller in the first place. The movie tries to make the Grinch relatable, but in doing so, they remove the essence of the character.Beyond that, there really isn't any kind of substance beyond the original story, which means this 1.5 hour film definitely feels 3 times longer than the original 30 minute cartoon because it really drags on."
412,"It was boring, bland, and unoriginal. Slapping some rap into the mix adds nothing and feels more like bad product placement for artists no one cares about anymore. The narration was lack luster and had no real... narrator vibes? A good narrator draws you in. They have THAT kind of voice. Williams... not so much. He seemed bored more than anything else and that shows.The animation was good and the choices made with Max were actually great, but other than that this Grinch felt... not Grinchy. The backstory left the audience with more questions than answer and the side plot with the Who family was never really explored. New characters were added, but no one was expanded upon. It wasn't the worst movie to come out in 2018, but it's far from the best."
413,"I LOVE this movie. In fact, I would go so far as to say: this is my favorite version of the Grinch. (This has caused controversy in my family). I love the book, and of course NOTHING can beat Boris Karloff's narration in the original cartoon....Jim Carrey's version is fine, but has always felt ""ehhhh"" to me. But this newest version was such a pleasant surprise! I laughed so so hard, just as hard as my daughter. This movie is also just visually stunning...the animation is great, and the details are so fun. I love Christmas, and this just gave me all the Christmastime warm fuzzys.
I can't say enough about the story, the original message of the Grinch is not lost at all, and I love how bits were added to it. It is not a bad thing that they humanized- or rather WHOMANIZED- the Grinch character. He was much more likable and it teaches a valuable lesson. That EVERYONE needs love...not just nice people. But even Grinches. That someone who was hurt long ago will lash out in ways even they don't understand, but in reality they just need a friendly hand. To ""close their eyes and listen with their heart."" In a world where we all judge unfairly, and basically love to gripe about anything...it's a nice reminder that there is no such thing as too much kindness. I think this particular world we're living in NEEDED this version of the Grinch story.The only gripe I would have is some of the music. The Grinch song, ""you're a mean one, Mr. Grinch..."" is fairly horrible. Like...if you're just going to slaughter a song, perhaps leave it out. However, I LOVE Danny Elfman's score...so beautiful.
Give this movie a chance...if you are too caught up in comparing it to the movies that precede it, then OF COURSE you will take issue. Watch it with fresh eyes."
414,"The Grinch (2018) is probably one of the most hollow films to come out last year. The characters are flat and boring, literally nothing important to the story happens until the very end (meanwhile you're just watching a bunch of meaningless nonsense being thrown at the screen), all the humor is forced and only 2 jokes actually landed, not even Benedict Cumberbatch's voice acting as the Grinch brings any charm to the movie.So in conclusion, The Grinch is a below average movie. It doesn't add anything new to the table, while it doesn't do any justice for the source material either. If you're going to remake something you have to justify why you're remaking it. What are you going to do differently? Why is this film special? What will people remember about this movie? This movie doesn't justify it's existence at all (besides money). If you don't do anything different then why even bother? As much as i hate to say it i enjoyed Jim Carry's take on the Grinch more then this.I guess one perk this movie has is entertaining kids and that's fine, i have nothing against that. But this Grinch should appeal to the new generation and i just feel like they deserve better then this cash grab garbage.4/10"
415,"Cute story but rubbish music, ruined it ... What a pity"
416,"I'm love the Jim Carrey movie The Grinch Who Stole Christmas. Or at least I thought I did. But this animated version is superior in five ways:1. The Grinch is sad and lonely and miserable. He's not angry and bitter and disgusting. That's an interesting take on the guy. Jim Carrey took the disgusting Grinch as far as it could go. In this movie you like the Grinch and he is kind to Max and to his reindeer. It's unexpected and kinda cool.
2. The Whos are fundamentally good. Yes Suess wrote the book as a lesson against commercialism of Christmas, but the village joins together and happily sings without all that stuff. In this version, they are good-hearted and love Christmas - Even singing religious songs! In the 2000 film they are competitive, gossipy, mean, bullying, selfish and easily misled by a vindictive mayor. Where'd that come from?
3. With better characters you also don't have any fear and hate of someone who is different. The Whos don't fear or dislike the Grinch. They dislike some of his behavior. Far more enlightened.
4. The kids and side characters were all cute as hell. Cindy Lou Who in the 2000 movie was the only bright spot in a dark world.
5. The narration by Pherrell and the extra verse throughout is clever and cool. The 2000 film seemed a little too afraid to depart from or add to Seuss' own words. This movie takes risks and they pay off."
417,"This was made for kids, if you are an adult expecting to get your moneys worth you might be disappointed. I like it and so did my kid."
418,"My kids are obsessed with the original Grinch and when they saw a preview for this one they were exact to see it.Not only did the kids enjoy it, I did too.Not sure why others are reviewing it so poorly?Has a great message. They have the Grinch portrayed as feeling lonely. And because he was lonely/sad/unhappy he wanted others to feel the way he did.My kids could see and acknowledge him not showing others kindness and that he wanted a family and not to be sad and lonely. At the end my kids were so glad to see Grinch found a family and was showing kindness to others, that he wasn't sad or lonely anymore.Loved the message of reaching out to others. Think about others, the Cindy Lou-who character portrayed this trait."
419,"This a good movie with good animation, good characters and great voice talent."
420,"The Grinch tells the story of Dr. Seuss's ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" but with more as a movie and not a cartoon short. The movie has a great message to it with not being alone for Christmas and being alone doesn't solve your problems. And with Cindy Lou Who helping her single mother have the best Christmas. The story has MOSTLY good comedy and has some great characters that are interesting. It's a good Christmas Film, that is pretty entertaining and spreads a great message to kids and adults alike. But it really doesn't do much different from the original classic or from Jim Carrey's version. The film also lacks hate for the Grinch and the Grinch In this film is too happy, when he is supposed to be cold and mean. And the twerk scene in this film is etrocious and it can really be cut from the film. And the soundtrack doesn't fit the movie, not bad but out of place. Overall, this movie is not the Grinch movie I would go to. I'd rather watch Jim Carey's How The Grinch Stole Christmas or even the original classic.

421,"Movie was not that bad, but the mexican version was dubbed by an idiot mexican comedian who cannot keep his characters out of his dubbing. Eugenio Derbez should never dub another movie ever again."
422,"Not too sure why this movie is getting such a bad rap but the movie was perfect for the entire family at Christmas time. The animations are incredible, the movie is filled with funny moments that had kids and adults laughing through its entirety and although most already know the story, the animated re-do is still worth it. Fun movie."
423,"Movie just ""ok"" nothing to spend money on until it hits some TV network that you are already paying for at home. Certainly just a kid movie with exaggerated colors and animation to keep little ones locked onto the screen. I got bored halfway through it."
424,"A visually stunning movie - the animation is spectacular and top-notch.The story is well known, but this versions offers a somewhat more subdued approach, which is fun and appealing. The kids will absolutely love this one, as it focuses on a pair of children and their friends who are trying to nab Santa on Christmas Eve, while the Grinch is trying to steal the festivities. Max-the dog, steals the show!This is much more laid back than the Despicable movies, though done by the same folks.Entertaining on a very soft and easy level."
425,"I really enjoyed myself. It was cute, heart-warming and funny. Sure, there are some parts that will induce an eyeroll but you have to keep in mind that the target audience for this film is small kids.And the one kid in front of me seemes really enthusiastic (especially over the character Fred). Obviously, the original TV special was only about half an hour long, so of course they're gonna embellish on this story. I didnt mind the Cindy Lou stuff at all. And I totally get they would want to add a backstory for the grinch himself, but I took some minor issues since I felt like it took away slightly away from the big reveal when hearing the Who's sing makes his heart grow. We already get little hints here and there of him being nice and caring. But its a minor quibble and I mostly enjoyed the story and chuckled a few times here and there. Music wise, there was a couple of moments where I thought to myself ""This music is reminding me of Edward Scissorhands a lot""...which cut to the credits I find out the music for this film was done by Danny Elfman. So that makes complete sense...and of course it was lovely...but at the same time it lacked some orginality. But the animation is beautiful. And just such great detail to little things like reflections, shadows etc.It certainly isnt the best film out there, but this could easily end up being something I revisit every Christmas. I'd probably give this a 7.5."
426,"When my dad asked to see it with me, I denied it at first. I thought it was gonna be one of those movies that have like really good trailers, and then once you see them, they're just awful! But, I thought, It's the Grinch, I have to see it! And I did! And it was awesome!"
427,"Far from being a legendary masterpiece, but also far from being awful. The animation is nice and the tale is the same as you remember, for the most part! It's quite funny and warmhearted which is to be expected from a family film(especially an animated one), but not all seem to pull it off. Would recommend seeing it, if you need to get into Christmas Spirit or if you have kids."
428,"The graphics and reimagination of Who-Ville were fun, and Keenan's character provided some comic relief, but the movie lacked any character depth and significant feel to it. I was bordering on boredom for most of the movie, so I would characterize this strictly as a movie for kids who all seem to like it."
429,"Essentially a remake of the Ron Howard live action film from a few years ago, the studio behind the Despicable Me films plies their take on this classic tale. Everyone knows what happens in the story so I won't give a synopsis here but what we get is a slight fleshing out of the story w/minimal back filling & some side characters beefed up like Cindy Lou's Mom & her friends. What killed the live action version for me was that it felt like a bunch of people in costume performing against green screens which uglied up the material rather than giving it any kind of life. Here by using CG animation, it works to the material's strengths (you can almost caress the fur on the Grinch's back as he strides across the screen) & the environments just pop. It doesn't reinvent the wheel but does it have to?"
430,"The Grinch is a good Dr. Seuss/Illumination film since Despicable Me. It may have bad elements like the 2000 film with a weak story and some unnecessary characters but thanks to it's Christmas colorful animation, enjoyable characters like The Grinch, his dog Max and Cindy Lou Who, a good performance by Benedict Cumberbatch and with some parts adapted from the original book, it manage to be a okay-to-good Christmas movie like the 1966 special that maybe some Dr. Seuss fans may enjoy or not from some that hate films based on Dr. Seuss' books. I give 2nd Dr. Seuss adaptation by Illumination a 7/10 rating for being a good Dr. Seuss/Illumination film in a long time."
431,"Sitting in the theater part way through my initial thought for a title to a review was ""Empty calories"", but in this case that would be too harsh. More accurate would be something like ""Innocuously & mildly entertaining"". This is quite a different Grinch, more of a victim than the ultra-nasty villain from the book and original TV show. As Kamunrah might say ""he's not bad, just vaguely grouchy"". So he gets in Wiley Coyote situations while ineffectively trying to spoil the Who's Christmas. This is brought to you by the same mindless folks that did Minions, so there's little soul to this movie, but there is a smidgen of real warmth and a nice wrap."
432,"The Grinch hates Christmas, the local town people, the 'HOOS' love Christmas.The town is decorated sparkly, tinselly, but this year the HOOS are making an extra special effort. The Grinch is miserable and decides to steal Christmas, he disguises himself as Santa and visits every house to steals all presents on Christmas Eve. This involves some slapstick comedy. All get returned and Grinch is forgiven.I recommend seeing in 3d, there's plenty of effective depth.
Best sketches are in the trailer.
Sadly Robin Williams is no longer with us.
(The Minions prison break short film, shown before this, looks excellent)"
433,"It was similar to the original cartoon which is probably the only reason why i liked it. I'm not going to go and buy it and make it our yearly christmas movie, thats for sure."
434,"Whereas live action versions of the Dr. Seuss stories have previously been a bit hit and miss, the animated adaptations have been much more consistently decent. From that spirit, and combined with the creative brains behind the ""Despicable Me"" franchise comes ""The Grinch"" a third adaptation of the legendary short story.With this beautifully animated version, Benedict Cumberbatch provides the voice of the titular Grinch. It's distinctively him, even with the American twang he's given the character. He is humorous and along with the animation team, they allow the Grinch to display several emotions outside of just ""mean"", which was the most common emotion of the previous incarnations. This version is generally a little kinder and more hesitant in his plan than in other adaptations, his relationship with the animals in the film show him in a warmer light, and begin his redemption even before his committed his single night of mayhem.There's a fair bit of padding required to get the film's plot up to a feature length most notably in the early shopping scenes that have been part of the trailers for a while. Whilst this is a mixed bag of fun and dull stuff, it does speak to the films general problem, there's not quite enough to keep the whole family entertained. There's enough slapstick for the younger kids but once that's not enough for you, you'll probably find the film a little lacking. I didn't care for the musical choices either - although I did like Pharrell Williams's narration.A passible way to spent 90 minutes, but not one that lives long in the memory."
435,It's simple. This story has been retold so many times I'm fine without seeing it again. There's barely anything new or different to offer the story. When I was in the theater my party fell asleep and the only people laughing were kids. The parents have all seen this before and so have I. Benedict Cumberbatch is a great voice for any Dr. Seuss character but he was wasted in this movie. There are some strong points to the movie like Pharrell Williams narration and the music but that was pretty much it.
436,"I cannot understand who allowed this script to be used. Almost every word that comes out of any character is dull exposition, it not only shows you in a very cluttered but pretty world, but batters you with retelling of what you just heard. The fact that this movie is a children's film is no excuse for it's terrible writing as many great kids films have created an emotional understanding simply from their visuals, for example, imagine how crappy the moment would have felt if as Carl from UP stood up at Ellie's funeral and said Ellie has died. It wouldn't work their and it didn't work in this movie. Go into this movie with earbuds and you will probably enjoy it twenty times more than me."
437,Story and script are very lame! I watched it thinking when will it end!
438,"You just can't mess with the classics, Jim Carrey was and will always be the best Grinch.
The new movie was terrible I walked out half way through."
439,"This was a complete waste of my time. I would think it would be a little exciting, but no. There was aboslutely no plot or emotions. This looks like it took a long time to animate and a few minutes to plot out. Seriously, if youre going to spend that much time making a movie, the least you could do is make it interesting. DO NOT, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, watch this movie. I didnt go to the theater in a while, and I thought this would be exciting, but it completly ruined the experience for me. My 12 year old kids didn't like it. Wish I could rate it 0 stars. Seriously, don't watch this movie!
The problem is that no one puts any effort in movies nowadays. Want a good movie? Watch an old one. The new movies have nothing but cringy jokes and cliche charecters."
440,"The movie was great and funny, but there was no big story change to it. So the ending is the same as the book and the old movie."
441,"Not a fan at all of this movie. I grew up like everyone else moving the cartoon and half way through my childhood came the genius adaptation with Jim Carey. However, this movie lacks an identity, isn't true to the Grinch story line and quite frankly is lazy. The Grinch is too clean and too much part of the town. If Keenan Thompson wasn't in this at all, I bet we wouldn't even have a 6/10 rating overall."
442,Myself and my family couldn't get past the horrible narrorator to even enjoy the movie. Why anyone would cast a trrrible washed up rapper to narrorate a Christmas movie classic is beyond anything I can understand.
443,The positive is it's well animated and it keeps my 5 yr old daughter entertained. The negative is everything else. I'll stick with the 60s tv special that's narrated by the inimitable Boris Karloff
444,"Love this movie, it's light hearted, bright and fun! Yeah the grinch isn't as nasty as previously shown in other films, but that's why I like about it. Simply an adorable movie, and it's my sons overall favorite, so that's a plus."
445,"Yep this is very worthy as a Grinch movie...it's the same as the others except expertly animated..because of that it adds a lovely fresh feeling to a Dr Seuss land.
Great fun and beautifully colourful."
446,The only thing I didn't like was the music and I'm a hip hop fan. It just didn't fit with Christmas. Maybe if it was better composed and produced but it didn't fut. Other than that everything was the best I've seen out of all the versions. Great family movie!
447,"This was a great remake! I love Illumination's animation style, it's truly incredible. The movie itself is a great retelling of the Grinch. The only reason I took stars away is because I wanted the Grinch to be more Grinchy."
448,"I don't know who that narrator was (or who he was related to!) but you could pull any kid from a 3rd grade classroom and get it better. And the music - atrocious, especially that sorry excuse of a cover of ""You're a Mean One"". Get a decent narrator and lose the so-called music, and the movie is entertaining and well done. But that ego-trip casting for a narrator, and the no-talent music makes it almost unbearable."
449,Great cast that made this Grinch movie a new classic that will be enjoyed for many years to come. I grew up watching the original and I am so glad they got an amazing cast and keep somewhat true to the original story.
450,"Horrible adaptation, even with high budget cg animation the voice over is horribly bland, the music ! oh my goodness, the movie open up with an annoying gangsta rap, they do know Dr seuss' Grinch are family oriented and has seasonal spirits, not some lame ghetto mumble he call it singing, it so forgettable and painful to listen,. Kis watching this will NOT rhyme or even like it, utter failure."
451,"So, it's Christmas, and I've been watching a lot of classics and modern films.The Grinch is a classic reimagined into what could be argued a classic for another generation and reimagined again...because?I honestly was confused when I saw they were releasing another remake. I grew up with the cartoon, and I was in junior high for the Ron Howard film, still remember going to the theater with my family. I just found myself wondering, ""Do we need another Grinch movie? How are they going to do anything new?""I finally saw it this year, and I've watched it a couple times now, thanks to my 2 year old. It's just meh, not an awful movie. There are a couple humorous moments, but it just doesn't have the magic.I like Cumberbatch, and I don't think the script gave him much to work with. His Grinch just isn't THE Grinch. He's more of that extremely grouchy, somewhat of a jerk, neighbor that nobody wants to talk to. The whole backstory they give him isn't much different from Ron Howard's. It's just Ron Howard did it better.Cindy Lou's character, forgetting the actress' name, is heart warming. I honestly thought her entire motivation was sweet. However, where Howard was able to connect these two characters in an impactful way, this film just didn't. They basically stumble upon each other by means of a freak accident and spend most of the story apart afterwardsAnd then we have Kenan Thompson's character, I honestly don't have much of anything good to say here. So, I'm choosing my words carefully. It's just Kenan being Kenan. He isn't doing much anything new since The Kenan and Kel show, All That, and SNL.The narrator is Pharrell, I think? The Cartoon narration was solid. Anthony Hopkins was a good choice. This just was uninspiring, and I believe he did some or a number of the songs. The music doesn't fit.All in all, it's entertaining but is missing all of the magic that made this a classic to begin with and made the original remake a classic too."
452,"I shunned this movie at the theater because I am a die hard grinchiac. I love the grinch as much as he hates Christmas.I made it through approximately four minutes into the movie before pausing it to scream profanities at the screen and melt down into a puddle of frosty the snowman melting into ice water in the greenhouse.What the blasted holly were you thinking????First off The Who's down in whoville are so stupid looking they could be a cross between cheap playdoh in a toddlers hands and claymation gone Atari graphic. What on earth was the plan. Did y'all just say hey let's make them look like cone heads with overinflated heads and snork bodies attached to giraffes. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?????Secondly,
Let's talk about the singing of ""You're a mean one Mr. Grinch"", which happens after the Grinch shatters a lamp to kill his alarm clock. How in the holly berries did this song get approved???? You totally screwed it up and not only did you screw it up you've made my ears cry from what I can only describe as cats speaking Klingon to Queen Elizabeth herself. I mean come on. I understand we live in a changing world, and music changes and older movies get updated but why make the best song to describe the main character as bad as chocolate syrup on nachos.I apologize to the people who have not seen a better version. Please do yourself a favor and see The Grinch version with Jim Carrey and Christine Baranski. I can promise you that they do not destroy songs or people.Now on a positive note, I was quite enchanted by the Benedict Cumberbatch as the Grinch. That was the only minor tolerable part but for the love of all that is good in the world the Grinch would sound much better in Benedict's ""Dr Strange"" voice.As far as the rest of this goes I suggest you take this movie review seriously and just say NO. Remember in elementary school ""JUST SAY NO"" DARE TO KEEP PEOPLE AWAY FROM THIS MESS.You would be better off getting a root canal from a penguin while a hyena dressed as Batman tries to draw your blood with his eyes closed."
453,The voices aren't animated at all. They make it seem like I'm watching a dulled down version of a Christmas movie.
454,"A fun family film that is beautifully animated. While not as enjoyable as the tighter-paced classic, the updated graphics can be appreciated."
455,Very entertaining. I enjoyed the modern twist on an old story. Good job
456,"This version is much closer to the book and to real people, makes the grinch seem closer to human and his issues more understandable for kids. It's a cute reboot and a new idea of the character that's easier for kids to break down."
457,"I have always been a big fan of the Grinch. I read the book, I grew up watching the original cartoon. I also grew up watching the live action movie. I decided to watch this new animated movie by Illumination and I found it to be very good. Illumination movies are either good or mediocre. But I thought their new Grinch movie to be one of their best ones so far.I'm fully aware of the criticism of this film by critics and viewers. This is the fifth Dr. Suess movie adaption and just the like the rest of them, this film has gotten mixed reviews. At this point, I hardly care about reviewers opinions anymore. It seems like you can't satisfy them no matter what you give them.I thought the animation was very good, the design of Whoville and it's Christmas decorations were also beautiful and well as the design of the snowy mountains surrounding Whoville. The Who's are cute like they always are and the Grinch's design is very accurate to the books illustrations. I love the way Max is written as a loyal and loving companion to the Grinch. Instead of a scared, depressed pet like we've seen in previous versions such as Grinch Night. They also introduced some new and likeable characters such as Fred the reindeer, Donna (Cindy Lou's mom) and Bricklebaum the bubbly Who who thinks he is best friend's with the Grinch. Even though the Grinch doesn't feel the same way about him. The writers managed to do something fresh with the story instead of copying everything that the original cartoon did.
One improvement that they did over the live action movie is that they managed to tell the whole story in under an hour and 25 minutes. While the live action film was almost two hours long.I know some reviewers have said that the Grinch's mean character was too toned down. One example was the fact that he doesn't abuse Max at all in this film. If you actually read the book, the Grinch doesn't actually abuse Max at all. The Grinch never hit Max with a whip or dragged him around by the tail or anything like that. That idea originally came from the Chuck Jones cartoon. Chuck Jones was known for directing the Looney Tunes cartoons and physical abuse was often used for comedic purposes in those cartoons and well was the Grinch cartoon. Now aside from Max, the Grinch was mean towards others in the film. There are scenes like where the Grinch ruins a little kids snowman and throws a snowball at the kid's face afterwards. The Grinch also mockingly talks down at Cindy Lou for writing a letter to Santa Claus. When he was at a supermarket the Grinch spitefully breaks a jar of jelly that a who wanted to buy for herself. He also tried to ruin the town's Christmas tree by catapulting a large snowball at it.There were a few scenes from the live action movie that they put into this film. Like the moment where the Grinch gets attacked by a housecat and the scene where Cindy Lou goes to Mt. Crumpit so she can invite the Grinch to a Christmas party. Grinch's backstory is somewhat similar to the live action version. This version of the Grinch's backstory worked a little bit better than the live action movie. Because it give you a better understanding on why the Grinch hates Christmas. In the live action movie, the Grinch chooses to hate Christmas because he was being made fun of at school for attempting to shave his face and also felt that he didn't belong with the Who's. In this version, the young Grinch grew up alone in a dark, dingy orphanage and he decides to leave Whoville because he couldn't handle being surrounded by other people who are happy. That felt a little more believable.So yeah, I liked the new Grinch movie. I was a little skeptical at first when it was first announced, but now I'm glad that they made it. Along with the cartoon and the Jim Carrey movie, I'll be watching this on tv around December."
458,"They ruined the message, music, and just about everything else. So angry that they ruined this. If you saw the preview, you saw the whole movie. If your old enough to remember the original cartoon and Jim Carey's version, consider yourself lucky. Full on suckage seems to be the new awesome."
459,"Animation was good, but even my 3 year old didn't like it as much and he loves anything Christmas! Don't really think they should've redone this one. It was fairly boring and I loathed Benedict's voice in it."
460,"I went in with an open mind and I honestly really enjoyed the animation. Very cute movie. I didn't like the grinchs voice and I didn't appreciate changing the narrative of Cindy Lou's family to a single mother theme. I get the message but I think it distracted from the original meaning of the grinch story line. I also felt that the movie was full of fluff that just dragged out the movie. Keep it simple, keep it charming, too much was changed to make a new narrative."
461,"As a big fan of Christmas movies, and a fan of both previous Grinch movies, I was very anxious to see this once it came out on DVD. Wow, was I disappointed! The good is that it is visually stunning. Even Hallmark couldn't jam so much Christmas onto a screen! My only animation complaint is the people. Somehow, they just don't look like ""Whos"" and I'm really getting tired of the over-used skinny arms with long, skinny legged humanoids (think The Incredibles, Despicable Me, etc.)
What didn't work for me was just about any audio - so much so that I turned it off after 20 minutes. The only kudos go out to actually having a religious Christmas carol being sung (God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen) and for keeping the famous ""Welcome Christmas"" song. The main problems I have with this movie are as follows: (1)Rap music in Dr. Seuss movie? Why? (2) The Grinch voice sounds like a slightly peeved Ned Flanders from the Simpson's. Not at all scary (3) The narrator sounds like a silky-voiced boy band singer; the complete opposite of Boris Karloff, (4) the overused character of Mr. Bricklebaum is instantly recognizable as Keenan Thompson from SNL. Does he not have any other voices or personas? And (5) An edgy, Cindy-Lou who is being raised by an overworked, exasperated single Mom. In conclusion, a big disappointment. Advice to creators of this movie: If you follow two great classics, do it right or don't do it."
462,"What else is there to say? It was an unmemorable way to spent an hour and ten bucks, but not bad enough to be mad about it."
463,I loved this movie. A nice movie with a good message.
464,I fell asleep after 15 mins but my grandson & granddaughter say it's super good
465,"Not bad till 60%, the rest boring. This time only, I wanted Grinch to win but nooo this would be not politically correct and not xmas correct ! Which mean less tickets and money !
I'm not going to watch it again.
In contrary I will watch again all Ice Age films.
Make a favor. Do NOT make sequel please"
466,"I took my sister to see this for her birthday, and had some pretty bad expectations of what the film was going to be like. I was surprised to find that that the film actually contained some good genuine funny scenes and had a good message about the sprit Of Christmas. It was however not as good as the original 2000 'How the grinch stole Christmas' starring Jim Carrey. Although this film could be better it was genuine funny film perfect for families and kids."
467,"While it could never capture the nostalgia of the original ""Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"", this film is still a nice tribute to the character we all loved watching on television growing up. Don't go in expecting it to be the best Christmas film ever, but don't expect it to be horrible either. The one thing I love about this film is it actually gives a great reason for why The Grinch hated Christmas. I love the family messages and inspiration all along the journey this film takes you on. All in all, a nice Christmas film I will watch each season to celebrate the holidays."
468,"Totally different target audience to the original grinch. Exclusively for young children, slow narration and simple storyline.
Feel very disappointed"
469,"Laughs, smiles and happiness: everything you wish from a movie and this is what it brought me. Cinema jam-packed meaning having to sit in front row 😕, but hey, a truly magical experience providing the joys of Christmas. Some may disagree but to me, no doubt I prefer this to the original: a Christmas comedy filled with fun and laughter. Thank you to everyone who helped make this movie happen. I hope you all enjoy watching it and that you all had a merry Christmas and have a happy new year. 😃"
470,"This version of The Grinch is completely wonderful and perfect for a family night or a nice clean date night without it being made only for young children.
It's full of funny moments, wonderful lessons of the heart, and the magic and wonder that's scene through the eyes of a child."
471,"I just left the theater with my family and for my youngest sons birthday (His B-Day was yesterday 12/23) we went and saw The Grinch, The whole family absolutely LOVED IT!!! It was full of love and heart. It's still the same old story of The Grinch who stole Christmas but there was little things that were added here and there that just made it really sweet and magical"
472,"Was a great movie to take the children too, wasn't disappointed at all and had plenty of action. I'd recommend to anyone with younger children"
473,"Me and my boyfriend are both in our 30s and I really wanted us to go along and see this movie to get in the festive spirit on Xmas Eve-Eve, and this movie was everything I wanted it to be!The animation and colours were just stunning, the storyline adorable and we were giggling the whole way through. The movie was just the right length, didn't go too silly or ridiculous, just good quality.Just go in with a fresh mind, wanting to see a cute festive movie and not comparing it to any Grinch movie you've seen before and you will have a fab time!"
474,"I said krampus would be back but not like this!!! No jack in the box, no snow men, no feasting on children's souls = bad krampus movie! #not my krampus #brimg back jim carry"
475,"First there was the 1966 Chuck Jones/Boris Karloff cartoon, second was the 2000 live-action Jim Carrey movie, this is the third adaptation of the famous story by Dr. Suess, a computer-animated outing from the makers of Despicable Me. Basically the Whos down in Whoville are preparing for Christmas, everyone is excited to be buying gifts, decorations and food. The only one who is not in the festive spirit is the cantankerous, green-haired creature called The Grinch (Benedict Cumberbatch) who lives in a cave on Mount Crumpit just north of the town. He hates Christmas, it is assumed the reason is because his heart is two sizes too small, his only friend is his loyal dog Max, they only come out of the cave if they need food or to do bad things. Six-year-old Cindy Lou Who (Cameron Seely) notices her mother Donna Who (Angie Tribeca's Rashida Jones) has been overworked looking after her and her twin brothers Buster and Bean. She decides to send a letter to Santa Claus to ask for help for her mother, but she encounters the Grinch, who sarcastically says she should talk to Santa face-to-face about it, she eventually decides to try and trap Santa with the help of her friends. With Christmas just around the corner, the festivities cause the Grinch to relive her sad childhood, he spent it mostly alone and unwanted in a rundown orphanage. The Grinch wants Christmas to end once and for all, so he comes up with the idea everything Christmassy and lessen his distress. To start his plan, he goes to find a reindeer, the only one he is able to lure is a fat reindeer he names Fred, and he steals a sleigh from frenemy Mr. Bricklebaum (Kenan Thompson). The Grinch has a test run, but discovers that Fred has a wife and child, with a heavy heart he lets him go back to them. On Christmas Eve, the Grinch makes a Santa Claus disguise and many gadgets to assist his theft, and he makes Max into a makeshift reindeer to pull the sleigh. During the night, the Grinch and Max go down to Whoville and begin stealing all decoration, presents and food, going house to house. The final house the Grinch goes to is Cindy Lou's, he encounters her when she attempts and fails to trap him, thinking he is Santa Claus. The Grinch is touched by her request to help lighten her mother's workload, and her kind advice about listening to the Whos' singing to take his sadness away, nevertheless he continues with his mission. After stealing every Christmas present and decoration, the Grinch and Max head back to the top of Mount Crumpit to dump it, but the Grinch waits to hear the sadness of the Whos. The townspeople wake on Christmas warning and are shocked to see everything festive has been taken, Cindy Lou believes she is to blame, for ""catching"" Santa, but her mother assures her Christmas is more than just presents. The Whos join together in song, the Grinch hears the singing and is puzzled to see and hear them celebrating without anything Christmassy. The Grinch realises that Christmas is more than just presents, he immerses himself in the singing, his heart grows three sizes, and he is filled with joy and wonder. The sleigh almost falls off the edge of the mountain, the Grinch tries to save it, in the nick of time Fred and his family come to the rescue. The Grinch and Max go to Whoville to return the stolen items, he admits his theft to the Whos and apologises before returning to his cave. Feeling sorry for the Grinch, Cindy Lou comes to invite him to her house to celebrate Christmas, he awkwardly attends. When seated down for dinner, he confesses that it wasn't really Christmas he hated, it was being lonely and his bitterness over being neglected, the Grinch offers a toast, and has the honour of carving the roast beast for the feast. Also starring Tristan O'Hare as Groopert, Sam Lavagnino as Ozzy, Ramone Hamilton as Axl, Angela Lansbury as Mayor McGerkle, Scarlett Estevez as Izzy, Michael Beattie as Store Clerk and Georgia Toffolo as Mrs. Toffee Apple, and narrated by Pharrell Williams. Cumberbatch putting on an American accent is a good choice as the exasperated hairy, green pest, Williams is an odd choice as narrator, and his version of the song ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"" is not very good. There is nothing wrong with the animation, and it sticks to the basic plot with the mean creature stealing Christmas, but the backstory of why the Grinch is mean isn't great, the lead character integrating with other characters is a mistake, it only makes you laugh a little, and the sentimentality is icky, it is nowhere near as entertaining as previous versions, a disappointing and very average seasonal animated comedy. Okay!"
476,"The grinch is by far one of my favorite Christmas movies. When this version came out I knew I needed to bring my 4 year olds to see it for their first movie theatre experience. I was very disappointed. Benedict as the grinch was terrible. The voice did not work at all. I mean I honestly don't think they could have casted any worse. I also didn't like the fact the who's have no fear of the grinch. He is welcomed in the city and just another passer by. He needs to start off as the antagonist for the movie to truly make sense.The backstory is a bit jumbled. The fact he was an orphan and was upset he didn't have Christmas made him despise it? What about thanksgiving, Easter, etc? The Jim Carey version introduced a perfect Christmas negative to support his hate of the specific holiday.It was a strange change to have Cindy Lou's mother's character take on this single struggling mom role. I did not like the change at first and figured it was just a response to today's current climate. However, it did allow the storyline to shift to Cindy Lou's wish and make sense why the change was made.All that being said, I'm not a movie critic and it's a KIDS movie. My daughters really enjoyed it. I was worried to play the Jim Carey version for them assuming it was too scarey. This new version is much more family friendly. Colorful and quick scenes with a lot of movement. I liked the new character voiced by Kenan. Reminded me of an ""All That"" character I would have watched as a kid. The overall humor was lacking and I don't recall any of the ""adults only understand"" jokes that are common in today's children's films.I recommend bringing the kids to see this movie, but don't expect to be entertained."
477,"We love watching the Grinch, we were excited when this movie came out. We thought it was going to be as exciting and entertaining like Jim cary's Grinch and Dr. Seuss. When you compare the latest grinch movie with the previous, it's very boring! Maybe it's the narrator . I was very disappointed."
478,"It was difficult to enjoy this film throughout.
The Grinch himself was brilliant, quirky jokes here and there.
I found the little girl who befriended the Grinch was annoying throughout, too cute and innocent, like the perfectly well behaved child that every parent wishes for. I suppose it's a good example to children watching this film.
Parents beware, there are a number of boring parts in the film so take lots of LOW sugar snacks to keep them going."
479,"Okay, here we have the newest version of that one character by Dr. Seuss who is most loved by many: The Grinch. This time it is not starring Jim Carrey, but this 2018 take is entirely animated and I have read people say that this is considered a potential candidate to be nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the Oscars, but I think the reception was not good enough overall and chances are slim for the film to make the field, even if the year 2018 in animation is not at its most competitive I'd say. The main character is voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch and you will find some other known names in the cast perhaps like Lansbury of course, but also Jones and Pharrell. I cannot say a whole lot, actually nothing at all, about these voice performances for I watched the German dub that has Otto Waalkes in it and actually I am glad I could listen to him all the time and not the in my opinion very overrated Cumberbatch. Waalkes also did a really good job, was perhaps the best thing about the film all in all. But that was not too difficult as the film also left me unimpressed for the most part sadly.First of all, I felt the little girl, who is really the defining human character here, was very uninteresting and pale, not just compared to the Grinch, but also as a standalone character. Her role is so major, but she brought so little. Very disappointing. Okay, as for the crew I will spare you the names of the many writers and directors. The one you need to know of course is Seuss and actually it's been over half a century now already since the making of the original about the one we have here. But the character is still interesting and relevant without a doubt. Even if I felt the sceneries and locations were not as memorable visually as they could have been, I liked the Grinch's looks a lot. Also really liked that they put the dog next to him and that he took good care of it which shows that he really has a heart and yeah as we find out at the end, the problem is his loneliness that turned him into such a miser. But yeah, even the ending that was kinda heartfelt did not feel as emotional to me as it could have been as in theory this ending has a lot to offer, not just for me. One thing I did enjoy though were the minor characters, like the loud goat or the fat reindeer that brings his family in the end and when we see him reunite with said family earlier, it is one of the best moments of the movie. Again that scene shows how the Grinch is a good guy deep inside as he lets him go, even if he cannot fulfill flawlessly his plan now. So he has to recruit the tiny dog to pull the gigantic sleigh. Oh well, the dog is really glad to be of help and that was kinda cute too. He really loves his owner, no matter how grumpy he may be.Okay I think that's all that comes to mind. I believe it was clear that this film would not really suck a whole lot from the beginning. But yeah, I also think it could have been much better too be honest and it was a bit of a missed opportunity as now it could be another decade or even more until the next Grinch movie. Solid quality from Illumination, better than some of their other stuff, but also worse than their best (for that the human characters were just too weak and almost entirely forgettable) I guess. One of the better, but certainly not best animated films of 2018. I give it a thumbs-up."
480,"The latest animated movie of Christmas' most famous bad character might not be strictly necessary, but it's still pretty fun - and revamped just enough to feel fresh, as it is a well-intentioned update of the classic tale. It is not perfect but it is an undeniably fun film to take the family to as Christmas approaches and to remind all that love and kindness can change things for the better. Colourful and amusing the kids should certainly get a pre-Christmas fun ride. For those that are somewhat older, the reception will be slightly colder, because there are moments that the little ones will enjoy more than their adult companions. But the movie leaves you with a warm feeling for the holidays and that is the most important. nikisreviews.gr"
481,"The Grinch was fine but not great. It was another one of many examples of Illumination making painfully average movies.Benedict Cumberbatch did a fine job as the Grinch and Keenan Thompson did a great job as Mr. Bricklebaum, but other than that it wasn't good.I did not expect a faithful adaptation of the other movies but the first 2 acts of this movie are barely an adaptation at all. They removed things they should have kept and kept things they should have gotten rid of. Plus most of the Children's story line did not need to happen and shouldn't have."
482,"This new version is desdicated to hooked up the next generation, with a softer tale with more jokes.
Thos movie explains better why the Grinch hates xmas.
It´s a movie to enjoy in familiy, free of violence, sex or cursing."
483,"Average but still prefer old one. Mayor woman, girl living only with mammy... Huh why we need to do this... Women rights... Seriously ..."
484,"I went to the theater with no expectations so I could be surprised with a new version of the Grinch. To start off I thought the graphics were wildly underwhelming. For this type of movie there should have been pizzazz on the screen or at least 1 single moment where the sight of all the Christmas lights and decorations have me warm fuzzies in my heart but the movie was totally lacking. In fact it made me feel cold. Next, it lacked a good story line. There was no real conflict or climax to the movie. It was rather dull. There were about 10 one liners I thought were either cute or funny which to me ended up being the highlight of the movie. Next, the voice of the Grinch. Oh the voice! The voice ruined the whole movie. In all grinch movies in the past the Grinch has sounded grouchy. In this movie he sounds like a classic nerd! He's supposed to be a crabby grinch who hates Christmas but he sounds like a young nerd. Whoever casted Benedict Cumberbatch for the voice of the Grinch missed the mark completely! Lastly a major part that stood out is the music. The music was totally off EXCEPT for 1 part where the Grinch was playing piano and Max was on the drums. Otherwise the music was ""off"" the whole rest of the movie. Worst part being when the Grinches heart was growing. We should have heart the Who's singing but we heard some cheesy ""revelation"" music before the Grinch had any revelation.
I love Christmas movies and always welcome new movies with open arms but this one fell grossly short in every single category."
485,This Grinch actually has a backstory explaining why he hates Christmas. It's a new spin on the character but makes him less of an absolute. He's also more of a regular dude with a bad attitude than a straight up nasty person. This Grinch has less edge than the animated original or Jim Carrey's live-action version. The result is his change of heart at the end is less poignant. The animation is downright impressive and some of the jokes land for older audiences but overall it's less memorable than previous iterations.
486,"It's been done a few times but this version captures the heart of the story. The jokes are plentiful and hit the mark for young and old. Cumberbatch leads an excellent voice cast he do a great job and the animation replicates that of the Seussian world perfectly.
A great directorial outing by the criminally underrated Scott Mosier who I look forward to seeing more from in the future."
487,"My kid wanted to leave half way through but I made her stay to the end. They picked the wrong voice for the grinch so I didn't like him from the start. He wasn't mean enough, funny enough, or clever enough. There are no surprises in the story. If you've seen the original, you know how this one starts and ends. Honestly would have rather watched the Jim Carey one instead. They didn't get Cindy Who right either. Just something about her got on my nerves. There are a few funny parts. I would have given this a five but too many people are giving it a ten."
488,The Grinch is about a person that doesn't like Christmas and whats to stop the village from having it.The Grinch a fun movie. The voice acting acting was pretty good. The animation for this movie was a great choice. The comedy was also funny for everybody. There were many scenes where I was laughing. The Grinch was too nice to be the grinch though. He was not like he has been in the other shows or movies he has been in.The Grinch was a fun Christmas movie to watch with the family.
489,It was so boring that we decided to see Ralph breaks the internet right after so the trip to the theatre wasn't a huge waste of our day...
490,"Very dull script- jokes were few and far between. Kids liked it ok, but I'll never sit thru this one again. The dog was cute, but otherwise super boring. Nephew said he hated how they distorted the persona of the grinch in that he wasn't that bad- very ""Disney-fied."" I do the the whole single mom thing since I am one- but not enough to give this movie more than 3 stars. Wait for the dvd."
491,"People can complain about how this movie ""wasn't like the original"" all they want. Because obviously it wasn't. Did you expect it to be? In my opinion, it brought a little more life to the story and it was very cute."
492,"The short version is this remake works. It has a modern feel, yet doesn't beer too far away from the original story. It was written well. I'm not sure if Pharrell Williams was the right choice to narrate the story, but I could be biased toward a narrator like Morgan Freeman. In any event, get some popcorn and take your kids to see this. They'll enjoy it."
493,"I loved Jim Carrey's rendition of the Grinch in live action as a kid, but in more recent years have come to see its numerous flaws. A new animated adaptation is certainly welcome from me, but this one may fall short of the timeless original short. All in all, I feel this rendition falls between the two, and is the best film from Illumination studios since Despicable Me. Most of my issues lie in Illumination, as a matter of fact, as their lazy low-effort style only works well in specific circumstances which they don't respect or understand, but this old tale is one well-suited for a budget animation team as most of its wonder lies in the diabetic coma inducing story. I expected much worse, but found myself chuckling more than a few times and cringing so few times that I could count them all on one hand (4).The clear standout is Benedict Cumberbatch who brings an incredible charm to the character, transforming him from a villain to more of an anti-hero. In this regard, this rendition is unfaithful, but in a way which changes the perspective on a story that would otherwise feel paint-by-numbers. The Grinch is a lovable jerk, petty and bitter, and it's hard at times not to sympathize with him as he terrorizes children for so much as looking at him funny.Other characters are fine as well, filling their duties. A standout is Cindy Lou, who while being a simple character works with the whimsical tone of the film. She and her mother have a sweet relationship and it's quite simply nice, and the juxtaposition with the Grinch allows for some awkward comedy. Even Max, the dog, works as a heroic sidekick despite being teamed up with the villain essentially. The characters are simple, but in a clever minimalistic way which avoids clutter and noise in favour of a focus on interaction.The gags are a tad hit or miss. Many were inoffensive and well-executes, but several were uncreative and have long been played out, such as that if the screaming goat. In this regard, this film is more for young kids, and is a fine way to introduce kids to this story, but it's hard for me to defend being exposed to the Grinch's scantly clad hind end bouncing up and down as a dog watches in shock. At least several people thought that was a good idea to put to film.The music was also largely hit or miss. While Danny Elfman's sckre is full of appropriate whimsy, the Grinch rap at the opening of the film had me reaching for the sulphuric acid inner ear drops. If you wish to modernize an old children's tale, do not do it by urbanizing the music. The credits rap is even worse as it alludes to the F bomb, oddly enough, while the rest of the film would be worthy of a G rating in my opinion.This film is at least finally correct. It is bright and colourful and fun, which were traits underplayed in the live action film, and I would argue these are most important in such a light story, and in that sense Illumination had the right idea in tackling this story.I almost liked this movie, but found it relatively underwhelming. Whilst it was better than I expected after watching the atrocities Sung and The Secret Life of Pets, I still feel Illumination somewhat dropped the ball. There is a little more umph this film needed to stand out from the crowd, and something just simply missing which could have made it a definitive retelling of The Grinch story. I'd recommend this for children, but for adults there's certainly an endless array of superior films out there old and new alike."
494,We went to see this with high hopes and it was a complete letdown. Don't waste your time or money going to see this. I so wish I would have waited to watch this on Netflix. I usually love most kids movies but this one was just terrible. We had three kids with us and they wanted to leave.
495,"The Grinch is a miserable green git who lives up a mountain. He hates the enjoyment which the village in the valley below gets from Christmas, so determines to ruin it for them by stealing it.Dr Seuss' story is a classic for American kids, less so for British kids, even though the cinema has previously seen both live action and animated versions. This time around, we're in CGI mode, and Benedict Cumberbatch is voicing the verdant curmudgeon.I guess this works well enough as a kids' film. It's bright and colourful, nicely animated, well-voiced. visually imaginative (albeit on-model with the Seuss master vision), has a lot of quite funny gags, and a decent moral. It's probably my fault that I find Seuss' work pretty smug - and therefore annoying - stuff."
496,"Are you kidding me! This movie was so disappointing compared to Jim Carrey's Grinch. Nothing will live up to it, and this was a huge let down. This Grinch was not funny nor mean like he's supposed to be."
497,"I love a good cartoon and this is a GOOD cartoon. Plenty of laughs and a good re- telling of a familiar story. To those who say ""there's no point, we know the ending"", I say we know the ending of WW2 as well but it doesn't stop them from making movies about it. Ignore the Grinches and see it."
498,"The Grinch (3 out of 5 stars).The Grinch is an okay animated Christmas movie and being like third adaptation of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. From the classic animated feature which was beloved to Jim Carrey's The Grinch which was fun and creative. However, this Grinch film does not do anything new to make this worth while. You got the same plot, same characters, new colorful animation, and decent humor. Adults may be bored or tired of seeing this being adapted again. But kids will surely enjoy this film.The animation was colorful and entertaining which made it fun to look at. Seeing Grinch angry annoyed look was fun. Seeing how he walks around whoville avoiding Christmas carolers, kids building snowmans, and being rude to customers at the store. How he treats his dog Max like his butler. Sure, he slowly find his heart to give back Christmas after he steals everyone's Christmas decorations and gifts. The characters were still fun. There is Cindy Lou Lou, whose mother is busy working all the time and trying to be there for her and her twin brothers. And she wants to trap Santa when he delivers gifts to ask for another wish.The story is the same. I feel like the movie was lacking creativity in seeing something different with this movie. Benedict Cumberbatch voices the Grinch and it was decent. It felt a little flat with the character. Really makes you miss Jim Carrey's version since he was closer to the original material.Overall, The Grinch is a fair family film. Plot, characters, and concept are the same. Been seen and done too many times. It lacked a bit of humor which adults will find a little boring. Except for the kids will love this movie."
499,"I very much dislike movies that show the whole dang plot in the trailers. Every single ""funny"" scene is also in the trailer. The movie was a fun watch but just wait and rent it later. Max the dog was the best part of the movie."
500,"Spoilers...Why does everyone feel it's necessary to change the story? Now Cindy Loo Who is the child of a single mom?And the voice of the narrator is very normal, boring even. No deep voice, nothing interesting, and at times hard to understand.And the rap music was a turn off for me. It's a Christmas story...Visually it was great. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 1 is because, I love Christmas! But this, was a disappointment."
501,"I'm a huge fan of the original with Boris Karloff but who can even touch that?
Well, Jim Carrey and Ron Howard, that's who. This one doesn't even compare to either the original or Ron Howard's production. The animation is excellent, but that's it.Whoever cast Benedict Cumberbatch in this role likely did so for his voice, which he didn't use! Instead he sounds like Bill Hader from SNL. Nothing wrong with Bill, I love him, but why this choice?Cumberbatch's Grinch comes off too normal, too comical, not scary, not evil, not the Grinch. He could have avoided being a copy of Boris Karloff just by playing it straight with his normal British voice, but sinister, nefarious and fascinating. It's such a shame.Pharrell Williams' narration is passable, but lacks the limerick like rhythm you expect from a Seuss story. And his singing of the Grinch song is awful and just wrong. Not the jazzy rendition of the original and not even an updated rap version you might expect.Max the dog doesn't even come off as adorable as in the original or the Ron Howard movie. He even seems to be a willing participant in the Grinch's thievery, not a cute loyal pup that we feel pity for.The Grinch is too nice to Max the dog. He doesn't even make him pull the sled at first. He even releases Fred in an act of kindness. The Grinch! Kind before his epiphany! That ruins the ending!The narrative about the Grinch's back story, meant to give the audience some sympathy for the Grinch, doesn't work, as the Who's in Whoville are partly to blame for not including the Grinch! He's not just mean. He's not the way he is because his heart is so small. He has social anxiety, is an orphan and has abandonment issues. The Who's don't even seem to notice the adult Grinch, green as he is and all.So the Grinch has just gotten a raw deal and his social emotional issues and loneliness just never got addressed by anyone who cares. I get the social message which isn't bad, but it takes the fun out of it all.Cindy-lou Who isn't even the innocent trusting and genuinely sweet person that even the Grinch could not resist being kind to, at least superficially. Nope. This time she even has a rather nefarious scheme to trap Santa Clause, even if for a well-intentioned purpose.The whole point of the original story is that someone, anyone, no matter how hardened, how mean, how nasty can be reached, can be redeemed. This Grinch isn't that mean. In the original this comes from the essential goodness of the Who's and that Christmas is NOT about materialism but LOVE. Most of that is gone from this version, at least the sudden and surprise revelation that the Grinch experiences all from one magical moment when the Who's show him the true meaning. No puzzling of his puzzler as it were.There are also very few genuinely funny moments, even for kids. The animation is strong and visually interesting but the story has been robbed and diluted of its strongest elements."
502,"I only watched this movie because my wife wanted a Christmas movie on Christmas. You could describe me as a grinch as I can't be bothered with those kind of holidays. But anyway I watched it, got bored after about five minutes, promised myself to sit through it and that's exactly what I did, sat through it. Okay the animation is well done, like almost any other animated movie I guess, but the story itself is just not my thing. The rhyming of Dr. Seuss might work for kids, but I'm not a kid and so I don't care. Benedict Cumberbatch, never been a big fan of him as an actor, and after The Grinch I will never be a fan of him narrating either. I thought I would be the only one who didn't like this movie but after reading the first page of reviews I guess we're plenty like me."
503,"The Grinch (2018) - 5.4Act 1 - 5.2Act 2 - 5.2Act 3 - 5.7
Changes up the story a bit but gets to the same pointObviously made for a new generation of kids, and kids aloneFew moments for adults to enjoyVery light film with simple jokes for kidsCindy-Lou Who's selflessness affects the Grinch in a positive way leading him to his redemptionWould only recommend for small children"
504,This was a cheap remake! The original was 100% better!
505,"It won't make anyone's heart grow two sizes, but it could leave viewers with an ear-to-ear grin. It's equally as forgettable, satisfying, and comforting as a store bought hot chocolate. Sometimes that's all you need."
506,Comedy felt forced. Taking a traditional movie and making it modern just kills the movie's purpose.
507,I like that it was a different take on The Grinch.
508,This was a shallow version of the original story. The Who's didn't even look like Who's from whoville. The Grinch was nice to his dog to the deer... His reasons for not liking Christmas was a plot whole.. when ever he went to town the people were nice to him. Huge disappointment.. The version with Jim Carry actually touched the real story that this one didn't even come close to.
509,"Somewhere in the making of this someone should have asked the question ""Is this good?"" Or ""Should we keep going down this path?""Unfortunately it seems no one did. This felt forced barely put together and sadly a pitiful grab at Christmas money.I have 4 children I have watched many animated programs from the symbolist made for toddlers to the most complex of stories , this was a complete waste of my time."
510,This movie sucks. They put in a bunch of the same dang Christmas music we hear EVERY YEAR. What little is left of the original music has been murdered...They totally deviated from the Grinch story and DIDN'T FRIGGIN RHYME AT ALL. Theodore is probably rolling in his grave over this disaster.
511,"FYI the song sang in the beginning of the New Grinch is Lame and stupid!!!! Make a better song weirdos.
The movie it self is okay. First grinch better. What happened to the Grinch!??!??"
512,So I remember the grinch as a child and I personally say this they way it was written was lazy and unexciting.. great animation is the only thing this movie had going for it?? And where did the deer come from never in anyway did the grinch hint that he looked for a deer.. and seriously where did these extra characters come from in this story.. I dont feel like it was about grinch avoiding Christmas or hating it. I feel like the directors are trying to push a story of a little girl who feels sad about her mom.. (who was never involved in the classic)... working and doing what an adult does. This movie was terrible in every way except for animation.. this makes the Jim Carey version (which was ok) look like a work of genius.. this move failed me and makes my child hood depressed.
513,Bad. Just a plain old bad movie. Avoid if you can.
514,Entretenida mantuvo la atención de mis hijos durante todo el film
515,Remakes tend to pale in comparison with the original. This is a half-hour too long
516,"My all respect to Benedict and his good performance , The movie has no charm about The Grinch himself and there is nothing attractive about that character even. The science in the film including mass, velocity and matter is very strange though I know it's an animation movie but not a fantasy to make him steal the gifts in that strange way. The scenario is awful and the music written with no more comedy than the trailer and didn't even smile once during the film with the silly plot and narrator who was the worst boring narration voice I have ever heard that seemed silly and as it is directed to 2 years old boy. I know it's an animation for kids but that doesn't mean to give them something silly and naive that is disrespectful to their minds and also animation movies is way past for kids only and most of us watch it as Disney's films and it's creativity. I give it one for the effort , one for the trailer and one for the trailer, one for Benedict's effort and 10/10 for the worst ending line I have ever heard. 3/10 Save your money and don't watch it."
517,"Why would they make a kids film with nothing funny in it. Ask my 9 year gran kid. Terrible voice characterisation, especially after Jim Carrey. Just boring."
518,"Not much adult humor in this animation. Usually these types of shows have subtle adult jokes spliced throughout the movie to keep the parents entertained. This one didn't. The kids seemed to like it, but they don't have the most refined tastes to begin with. If you can I would recommend waiting for the video and let the kids watch while you are doing something else."
519,"The movie was off. It was boring. I almost fell asleep and none of my kids wanted to finish watching. The story does not hit any interesting climaxes.. And the plot was dragging and unnecessary.I'm not sure if this is supposed to be inspired by the original or it's supposed to be it's own separate story, but it was really bad.The foundation of each character was weak.I'm a fan of The Grinch by Jim Carrey, but this one was not fun. It wasn't imaginative.. how do I say it.. It was too personified and modern. It was not like Who-ville or Who-people at all.It's not a movie I want my kids to remember as ""The Grinch.""
Stick with the original if you want a masterpiece."
520,"Can't watch anymore but knew having watched the original that NO-ONE plays the grinch like Jim Carrey.Also, Sunday-Lou's mum gave the twins porridge which one twin threw on the table. She then threw them toast yet no sign of the porridge on the table. Crap sorry."
521,"I love IMBD and have been using it since I was 15. This is the first review I have given only because this movie was so freaking horrible. The storyline, the music, and the horrible jokes, I hated every bit of this movie. If you are close to suicide, do not watch this movie for this movie take whatever will you have left and crap on it."
522,I cannot stress how much I hate this movie. It is a cash grab that captures none of the magic of the original. If I wasn't at a birthday party I would have walked out on this movie 20 minutes in.
523,Boring.....so incredibly boring....nothing interesting happens at all. Don't waste your time.
524,"The CGI animation is okay, but the voices are miscast and the screenplay is inane. This is the one Grinch movie where I sided with the Grinch. The only other high-budget other awful animated film I can think of is Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. Stick with the original 2D version narrated by Boris Karloff. Even the Jim Carrey version, which was somewhat annoying is far better than this monstrocity of filmmaking. While I like Benedict Cumberbatch, he was totally miscast. Even Jim Parsons would have been a better choice for the Grinch's voice and the narrator for this made me cringe. Despite all the hype, this is totally unwatchable and annoying for anyone with a modicum of intelligence who's over the age of six."
525,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Well done remake of the Grinch story. It's both humorous and touching, but not too much ... a treat of storytelling this Christmas season. Bravo!"
526,"Despite it's predictable plot, The Grinch is a great animated remake that's both funny and heartwarming. The animation is incredible and beautiful. The majority of the jokes are really funny and the voice acting is great overall, with Benedict Cumberbatch giving a fantastic performance in particular."
527,"This movie was so disappointing I don't think I can convey it even through this review. As eager as I am to catch any new Christmas movie this time of year this one was a total waste of money and I came very close to walking out had not my young daughter been with me.
This is a sad attempt of stuffing multiculturalism and diversity down our throats with cartoon characters of the Who's who are already a quirky set of folks but now we have to be sure they come one in every color!
The broken family component and forced acceptance this movie strives to place does not belong in a Christmas classic.
It is a sad rendition of an already perfect classic that they're trying to mop over.
The narrating by Pharrel is some of the most awful I have heard in a long time. Articulation was terrible.
Do yourself a favor skip the theatre and use this money to go buy the original classic as it's exactly the same storyline yet done with better creativity."
528,"In a nutshell horrible storyline, voice acting, narration, flow, and humor. Although there were a couple funny moments. Not a whole lot to say about this movie. Wasted my time going to see it so I'm not going to waste anymore of my time reviewing it. I think Disney just expected to make money off of the name. Definitely not a show I will be looking forward to watching every Christmas. Let me have the 26min 1966 masterpiece which I thoroughly enjoy watching every Christmas."
529,"To be honest, The Grinch is nothing new. The film is just trying to capitalize on Dr. Seuss's novel. Illumination has outdone themselves with this one. The film is boring and has very little humor in it. The film perverts the original novel and is just filled with millennial humor and pop culture references. Illumination rarely ever produces a good film these days, though most of their properties have potential this one is just a crappy attempt to get involved in the Christmas season. and for that i give it 1/10 stars."
530,"Not sure what this movie was, but it wasn't the Grinch! Totally different story line that was depressing as could be. Terrible, but made me fall asleep, so there is that."
531,This movie is just not good. The music was off. The story was off. Hate Benedict Cumberbatch voice. Really not funny at all. The best parts are shown in preview. So disappointed. Im gonnna stick to the classic.
532,Four year old son woke up and looked like he could of played a better grinch 😂
533,"I would not recommend this movie, ESPECIALLY if you want your child to continue believing in Santa!!! It was ok up until the part where the Grinch tells the little girl that Santa doesn't exist, because no one has ever seen him... Um WHAT?! My 10 year old daughter turns to me and looks me straight in the eyes, and asks, ""That's not true is it? He's real right?!"" I then grabbed the popcorn and drinks and left the theater with her. I simply said, ""Of course he's real! Why wouldn't he be?"" And she replies, ""You heard what he said, no one has ever seen him."" And no matter how much I tried to convince her, she would deny it every time.
So yeah, my daughter doesn't believe in Santa anymore. Thanks Grinch. Thank you VERY MUCH.For a positive remark on the movie, the goat part was funny I guess..."
534,"From the music, which changed significantly... really felt out of place.The new rhymes, didn't feel at all like Dr Seuss, in addition to a definite not Dr. Seuss narrator.To the entire change of story line, this one more about a mother who isn't married having trouble raising her kids. That never really gets resolved either.To the Grinch himself. Looks like a teenage character, and doesn't have the feel og Grinch at all.Really horrible."
535,"Why bother making this, when there's a great live action Jim Carrey version out there already. We did not need another Grinch movie."
536,"I was excited to watch this as much as my daughter. The animations are gorgeous as is the voice acting, however I was taken by complete surprise to hear pro-Jesus christian music. All cartoons directed towards children should not contain any religious propaganda. Children are impressionable and easily manipulated which I'm guessing the christians purposely utilised this to their own benefit to recruit more mindless sheep to their cult. It would have been way better of a movie. Dr Seuss never used religion in his stories, this is an insult to his work!"
537,"We have the terrible Ace Ventura version, what would possibly possess you to make another one???"
538,"This film was certainly better than the one with Jim Carrey. That one was mean spirited, and he looked down right scary. This one, if you'll put nostalgia aside and just take a look, I think you'll find is much truer to the book. Yes, it's true that this version still has filler plot, but it's luckily just enough, not a whole lot. Now this next statement may cause you to give me guff, but one of my problems was the Grinch wasn't mean enough. In the cartoon and other movie, he's abusive to Max. But in this version, that is something it lacks. The Grinch in this version isn't mean, just kind of a jerk. And I feel that is something that just did not work. But the animation is gorgeous and full of life. The live action version's colors were muted, which caused me great strife. The voice acting by Benedict Cumberbatch was a delight, although at times his voice just did not sound right. ""Overconsumerism is bad"": The film's message rings clear. Although with all the marketing and tie-ins, the irony seems to be lost here. It's pretty cookie cutter, there aren't many surprises. It did not make my heart grow nor shrink three sizes. It's pretty good animation for a $75 million budget. Though everyone looked a bit like a CGI Muppet. This is still a good attempt by Illumination, for, for all of it's flaws it at least had dedication.
Grade: C 7/10 3.5/5 stars"
539,"We don't need the Grinch's psychology; the character's original intent is to serve as a stand-in for anyone who has forgotten ""the meaning of Christmas"". Making him a secluded, unloved orphan takes away all the joy in the story, and completely changes the message. And whose BRILLIANT idea was it to change and dumb-down Seuss' brilliant narration? The line to apologize to Jim Carrey and Ron Howard starts behind me."
540,I think they should have left this on alone. At least this time the characters didn't have those weird faces.
541,"The Grinch is a movie that was released last year. I know that the film, like the 2000 live action film, is supposed to be based on the Dr. Seuss book of the same name, but parts of it felt like Despicable Me without Gru and the girls. Benedict Cumberbatch was great in the film as the Grinch, and there are times where he kinda sounded like Kelsey Grammer.This film is not that great, but not awful either. It's a decent evolution from the 2000 film and the book."
542,"It's ok, a fun movie but it's not a patch on the Carey version from 2000."
543,"The Grinch is a 2018 Christmas movie based off the Jim Carrey version and is pretty much the same as the live action film. The Grinch(Benedict Cumberbatch) lives in Whoville and hates Christmas as he never celebrated Christmas when he was little.
The animation is nice,story is good and Benedict Cumberbatch did a good job."
544,"I was really looking forward to this film, it was animation and Illumination Entertainment. I loved the Lorax and I was expecting the same, but it never delivered. I don't think they did anything wrong, it just can't beat the classic TV special because it was a lot shorter. The same with Jim Carrey film, it doesn't need to be that long. Please don't make it again for a full feature film. The original classic TV special (1966) was 25 mins long and it was perfect in every way."
545,"The well-known story gets a fresh, new look with this 2018 version. I so badly wanted to like it, but unfortunately it was not to be.The animation is fantastic and the 'camera angles' are really good for an animated film. None of the characters really stood out as special, though, except for the dog Max, who was by far my favorite character. I didn't find the Grinch's story believable or interesting. The film itself is over-sentimental at times, while other scenes are simply too childish, looking like a cartoon instead of an animated feature.'The Grinch' (2018) is definitely more for children, as I doubt it will have the desired effect on adults. This was not as special as films like 'Arthur Christmas', 'The Polar Express' and the more recent 'Klaus'.If you've purchased the DVD, its worth watching the 3 Mini Movies included. They are much funnier than the feature film.https://paulsmoviereviews.wordpress.com/2019/12/03/the-grinch-2018/"
546,We thought this version was really good...more colourful and bright. The characters were really cute. I agree that Grinch should have been nastier than he was but not a big deal. Did NOT like the Jim Carey version...weirded me out. Original version is still the best but this is a good remake.
547,"Is this basically the same movie as the original cartoon? Yes. It is still a fun, funny and exciting movie that will hold your attention? Yes. I'm a huge grinch fan and love both the other ones. This one is awesome too. Super funny, clever, and there are some awesome gadgets. Worth the watch if you like the grinch."
548,"Very good, true to original, fun additions, a little anticlimactic at the end.I liked it far more than expected."
549,This film just put me in a really good mood and as someone who wasnt keen on the jim carey ittiration this was an awesome alternative. Will be a christmas tradition for me
550,"If you like slapstick comedy, people animated firmly within the uncanny valley, cliché characters and a plot as pointless as a sphere, this is the movie for you. Just like Illumination's other works, this movie revolves firmly around bright colours and humor suited for six-year-olds, with little else to offer. It felt like I was watching a less-original version of Despicable Me, but one that cared nothing for its viewers' intelligence. The animation was sub-par by today's standards, the music didn't fit the atmosphere, the narration was unnecessary and irritating, the characters were either inconsistent or consistently annoying, and the voice acting was unimpressive (please Hollywood stop casting Cumberbatch in American roles).
I care deeply for animated movies and I am truly sick of Illumination butchering the genre for a quick buck. If your toddler needs entertainment for 90 minutes while you take a nap then by all means play this, but I wouldn't recommend it for any self-aware audiences."
551,"All people are overreacting about it ,while the mobie is not that bad .
Its a Christmas movie and it covered all what it needs for this.
The animation was delightful, no problem with mouth movements , no lags and no loops which i respect about 3D animation movie.
The plot was well done but not perfect and this is the biggest drawback as it leaves you asking : how did the grinch get such a good mansion?? Where does he gets all this money from ?? Where did he find max ? Why does max love him so much ?? This could allow the writer to introduce a sequel just about the relationship between max and the grinch but before the movie's period.
Benedict Cumberbatch was so good and I didn't find anything bad about him .
It is a cold night Christmas movie that would warm your soul . 💞"
552,"Quite simply my kids love this film!
I personally think it's quite well done. But each to there own"
553,I went to see this movie with high expectations and it met what I was hoping for. I thought it was very well done and very up to date with its humor and story line. Great flick for the family and kids if you're interested in seeing it.
554,7/10 - colorful and creative holiday fun for the whole family
555,"I love the classic cartoon. Live action with Jim Carey, but this... this is nothing but a lump of coal under your tree. I think the political correctness finally caught up, on a classic just like The Grinch. I honestly finished to see what other things I found wrong with it, and what and how they butchered this story we all know well."
556,"I much prefer this version of The Grinch to those of the original and the Jim Carrey version. It is fun and immersive, and the graphics are beautiful and detailed. It shows you the fun of Christmas and takes you on an emotional journey through the eyes of the Grinch and his dog, Max, who incidentally is incredibly cute! I highly recommend it."
557,"Now having seen all 3 grinch movies. The original was just like the book, simple and to the point of an angry green monster who hated christmas so he stole it... Then we have Jim Carrey's version of the grinch, which included him as an orphan with two old women as parents, who was made fun of on Christmas so therefore he hated christmas and stole it... Then we have this cartoon version. Of a grinch who was not necessarily angry but he was clinically depressed, more psychological issues than anything, but he had his moment, he was a man who grew up in an orphange who was never given christmas so he hated it for that reason, so he stole it. His trusty companion Max was not like previous movies where he is a timid shy dog, in this movie he is is right hand side kick that does everything to the best of his abilites for his master, and enjoys it for the most part. The thought of Cindy Lou kidnapping santa clause because her mother is a single mother and wants her to be happy was a twist.
This movie in my opinion was very good simply because it was very whimsical, very cute and very colorful, it added tiny intricacies that were unique, as illumination does with most of its movie but this movie add great bits of humor and sarcasm with a modern twist. A movie worth watching in my opinion."
558,"Went to see this in theaters with my 2yo and could barely pay attention so at first I didn't think it was so great. Now my kid is almost 3 and we watch this movie every day, you get used to the voice of Benedict as the Grinch and you can almost always find some funny new background character every time you watch it; like at dinner in Cindy Lou's house at the end, in the background in the kitchen, Groupers dad is licking the stirring spoon and putting in back in the pot. The movie is visually beautiful and nothing short of greatly detailed. The songs also took me a little while to get used to but are very catchy the more you watch. A much needed new twist to help create a more modern take on a classic, timeless tale"
559,"I was hoping to enjoy this version, once it began, I thought maybe it was a continuation...no. I am sadly disappointed and did not like this version at all. The original and of course Jim Carry's version were going to be tough to beat, why did anyone think the Grinch even needed to be remade?? The colors were visually stimulating, the songs were lack luster, hardly anything close to the original story, yet nothing to even add to or improve. Uninspired, boring and ho-hum. Like many others have already stated, the voices didn't work, the story changed for the worse, characters changed for no reason and the reason I, and obviously many others, felt no connection to anything to do with this sadly, easily forgotten mess of an old and loved story with memorable and beloved characters. Dropped the ball big time here."
560,"I really did not want to rent this one reading all the comments most bad ones and waited forever. Jownits march and I rented it. Needless to day we loved it. It was heartfelt ,funny and grinchy all at the same time. It's really a family movie . I felt it was about forgiveness and growth. Cindy who isent aw adorable as other movies but you get past it real fast. The back story isent yo different than the Jim Carey version which is nice. I crywd , my.husband almost did and my kids really really enjoyed jt."
561,Best Grinch movie by far! Always enjoyed this movie series. It helps me enlighten my spirits and appreciate what Christmas is all about - The spirit of the Holidays.
562,"This movie is dark, sad, heartwarming, kid-friendly, and funny/goofy its a good movie one of the best movies based on kids books"
563,"The Grinch - While ""The Grinch"" is enjoyable in some areas, (very few), this remake of Dr. Seuss's classic tale fails to provide any good characters and does not boast a good cast, (with the exception of Benedict Cumberbatch.)"
564,"So here is the thing, movies with over the top adult humor but marketed to kids anger me! Nothing worse than taking your four year old to a movie and then having to explain things to them... or, worse yet, violence or unnecessary foul language! I'm far from a prude, but when I take my kids to see a movie I don't like having to perform a therapy session just to get them to go to bed that night!Next, I grew up and LOVE the original Grinch! Hated the Jim Carry version. I loved this version! I felt good leaving the theater, it wasn't an excessively long kids movie where they lose interest after having to endure adult humor for most of it... it is a good one!"
565,"While some might disagree, Jim Carey's Grinch was the last Grinch movie they should have made. This movie felt like they created it just because a few of the other Dr. Suess movies did well. The ""Lorax"" and ""Horton Hears A Who"" were good movies, but they were original's, where this one was trying to create a different Grinch story."
566,"I've seen a lot of people complaining about this movie not being like the original Dr. Suess story which is what, for me, made it a really great movie. The story was cute and followed the general plot of the original but added fun little twists. If you want the over played original story, watch the old movie. If you want a movie that brings a fresh twist on a classic, watch this."
567,"This looked good visually and then the horrible music kicked in and ruined the movie, then the voiceover started and made it even worse. And when I thought it couldn't get worse The Grinch started talking to actually ruin things further. The final nail in the coffin was the horrible plot of the movie. Stay far away."
568,"This movie was a disappointment. The Grinch acted as if he already had feelings, which he is not supposed to till the end. They changed the whole entire story. The voice acting was bad, although I love Cumberbatch as an actor he was not right for this role at all. The sound track was a disappointment as well, Jim Carrey is and always will be the best Grinch."
569,"You know, Sometimes I really don't know the idea of remakes. It's the same story just add in the visual effects. It's a big cliche. We already had the original in 1966 and the Jim Carrey one in the year of 2000. The 2000 Grinch was honestly a very good one. A lot more effort. And just when you thought the Grinch stories were over. Well say hello to this unnecessary same plot and a cliche twisted ending. While I do like the Grinch's personality in this, It was just more of an add in to make him look more good. Grinch hates Christmas, Grinch realizes his mistakes, Grinch likes Christmas. Same story everytime with a cliche lazy backstory. Everything was pretty much add ons to make the movie look good and to follow the plot. It was a cliche plot. Boring, Nothing Entertaining, and could be the reason why Illunination is falling apart. Was this remake neccessary? This has got to be one of the most pointless movies I've watched in my life. It's the same story just add in the visual effects, and more character personality. That's it. That's all you get for entertainment. Prepare to be disappointed and left bored and tired when you already the story when you simply could have just rented the Jim Carrey one for the family to see. We didn't need another Grinch movie Illumination. I'm sorry but the Grinch is a cliche story that will be known as a classic story with nothing entertaining about it in the future. A bad pointless movie that will make you go, ""We get it!"" Don't waste your time it's the same story. From a scale of 1 to 10, This is a 1. Lazy effort, Lazy writing, Add in more cool animation and character personality, Congratulations. You still get a pointless cliche unnecessary movie. Terrible."
570,"Entertaining, kid-friendly, decent story, overall great for the family. The only thing disappointing was that the Grinch was not voiced by Jim Carrey! Would have made the movie THAT much better!"
571,"This film tells the story of a grumpy man who steals Christmas to make everyone else miserable.The animation itself is great, and I am impressed by how real things look. The snow looks just so real that it amazes me. However, the story is just rather plain and dull. Nothing much happens, and the jokes are not funny. It was not as entertaining as I hoped."
572,"I appreciate the movie but, I really think they got the wrong voice. Plus the dubbing, it's quite a disaster, I cringed a lot while watching this. Grinch's lips and the voice don't match at all! I've got nothing against benedict coz he's a brilliant actor but this movie just didn't work for me and worst, my niece didn't like it either. Sigh."
573,The movie looked like a vehicle for 3D and not much more. Of course we weren't watching it in 3D so we found the way it was shot annoying. The story was very formula. I suppose little kids would be entertained but it is not going to be a movie you want to see every year.
574,"I entirely enjoyed The Grinch, as an adult. But I'm not quite sure if it's appropriate for kids. There are lots of misbehaving like spitting pickles or throwing snow balls into face.
Apart from that, well done to lighters and compositors. It's super sharp and really nice. Animation of characters are stunning and effects are just beautiful."
