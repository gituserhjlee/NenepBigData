0,"I really enjoyed the first 2/3 of this film. They are filled with palpable tension and a general unease at not being able to see the ""monster."" This is another example of how what you cannot see is often scarier than what you can see. The direction is great and perfectly places the viewer in Elizabeth Moss' shoes, which is what generates most of the tension as you the viewer are also unsure where this invisible person is at all times. The spin of domestic violence also lends a new, modern twist on the classic premise.Where the film falters is in its third act with some significant plot holes regarding cameras and visibility of certain actions. There were also several times where the film felt like it was at its conclusion, but kept going. The ending will likely be divisive, however I didn't hate it. The Invisible Man is technically a very well-made thriller, but loses a few marks due to some issues with the plot."
1,"I'm surprised at the number of highly negative reviews on here. Most of them pertain to plot issues. I'm all for exposing plot holes, but most of these could be easily explained with a little creativity. Just some examples: People complain that the antagonist has super-human strength. This is not the case at all. He has the advantage of the element of surprise. A moderately strong (invisible) male could lift a female in the air, and could toss her across a table; and could beat the crap out of bigger dudes. People complain about the third suit: But there could have been ten suits, and he could have lost track of a suit. People complain about the dog being at the house; but for all we know she lost track of the dog on the night of her escape and the dog returned to the house later. People complain that she would not risk her plan by taking the dog with her; but it would be simple enough to take the dog with her and meet her sister in the road, while her husband sleeps. People complain about how he gets around: but his brother could drive him; or he could jump on a bus and hide; or he could just take off the suit and drive around like a normal person; or he could put on a wig and makeup. People complain about the guards not defending themselves better; but they have never encountered an invisible man before and would not know what is going on. People complain at her reaction in the restaurant; but she would be in shock and there's no telling how a person would react to that. Some people complain about how quickly the Uber driver arrives; but the scene does show her looking at her phone (and the Uber app), and we don't know how much time has elapsed before this time. (It's possible that she was running and hiding in the neighborhood for 5 minutes.) Maybe the husband developed the suit at a research facility and made a few extra suits for himself and took them home. I'm not saying there are no plot holes, but the complaints here are far too harsh, and lack imagination. The movie is novel, suspenseful, and interesting, and well-acted. (This is not exactly a plot-hole, but wouldn't a DNA test on the fetus prove that it was his son, and thereby implicate him in the crimes? The brothers weren't twins.)"
2,"H.G. Wells's original The Invisible Man (1897) suggests that rather than something as powerful as invisibility being used for the betterment of mankind, it would instead be used to fulfil private desires, ultimately leading to the moral corruption of otherwise good men. In probably the best cinematic adaptation, Hollow Man (2000), this is taken much further, with the suggestion that the results of invisibility would be nothing less than sexual violence, evil, and madness. However, despite the centrality of this theme in the core story, reframing the template as a tale of domestic abuse and PTSD, as happens in this latest adaptation, which focuses not on the male scientist but on a female victim of his, is a fascinating idea, creating the potential for some timely #MeToo social commentary, particularly as it relates to issues of not believing women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting. But potential only gets you so far, and what could have been a really insightful film eventually proves itself relatively incapable of using issues of domestic abuse as anything other than plot points to get from one predictable scare to the next.The film begins as Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) is putting into motion a plan to leave her domineering and abusive boyfriend, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), a wealthy pioneer in optics. Having drugged him, she leaves their high-tech home in the middle of the night and is picked up nearby by her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer), who takes her to stay with their childhood friend, James Lanier (Aldis Hodge), a policeman living with his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Although assured that Adrian can't find her, Cecilia is clearly suffering from agoraphobia and paranoia. That is until Adrian commits suicide. Contacted by his brother Tom (Michael Dorman) who's handling his estate, Cecilia learns that Adrian has left her $5 million. However, despite her best efforts to move on, she just can't shake the feeling that Adrian is still around, watching her, sometimes even in the same room as her. And the surer she becomes that he's not dead, the more everyone else becomes worried about her mental well-being.Written and directed by Leigh Whannell, this latest adaptation of Wells's original is not actually about the invisible man. Indeed, short of a background shot of him lying in bed, a shot showing only his torso as he runs through a forest, and a close-up of his hand, actor Oliver Jackson-Cohen doesn't even appear on screen prior to his apparent suicide. Adrian is not only the invisible man of the plot, so too is his character ideologically invisible. Which makes its own statement, and it's a statement worth making - men like him don't need to be present to continue to cause harm. In this sense, at least initially, the film is more concerned with the fear Adrian has instilled in Cecilia; in the early stages, Cecilia's main enemy isn't Adrian so much her inability to move on from him. Along the same lines, the film looks at issues of how women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting are often ignored or openly disbelieved.Aesthetically, the film looks terrific, particularly Stefan Duscio's cinematography, into which is built Cecilia's paranoia. For example, countless scenes involve the camera panning away from her, moving across the room, showing us nothing at all, and then panning back. Ordinarily, this would be textbook unmotivated camera movement, but here it conveys how Cecelia fears there may be something in the corner to which we panned. And now, thanks to that camera pan, so do we. There are also many shots which in another film would be awful framing; isolating Cecilia in the frame and filling up so much of the screen's real-estate with empty negative space. Except, again, in this film, such negative space has an ominousness not applicable to regular thrillers. In this way, Whannell can instil fear and dread simply by pointing the camera at an empty room without the need for any FX, VFX, makeup, elaborate props etc (which no doubt played a significant role in keeping the budget down to a minuscule $7 million). And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Moss's performance, which is excellent, especially given that so much of it is her on her own reacting to nothing whatsoever, having to communicate confusion, fear, anger etc through little more than her expression.Before talking about why I didn't like the film, however, I want to reiterate that I honestly can't say how much I admire the idea to reconstitute the genre template as a story about domestic violence. And it's an especially timely reconstitution, coming as it does in the era of #MeToo, when so many powerful men, once considered invisible in everything but name, able to perpetrate their crimes with impunity, have been revealed as the monsters they are. So I have no problem with the ideological paradigm shift. My problem is with the execution.For one thing, we know from the get-go that Cecilia isn't imagining things, that Adrian faked his suicide and is now stalking her whilst invisible. This isn't a twist, and the film makes no attempt to hide it. Granted, this is kind of unavoidable given how well-known the property is, but had the film allowed for even a little bit of ambiguity, it could have done wonders for emotional complexity, turning a story about invisibility into a story possibly about mental collapse. This would have effectively placed the audience in the same position as the other characters, doubting Cecilia's state of mind, which would, in turn, have enhanced the potency of the socio-political allegory. Another thing that bothered me is that in a film so focused on surveillance and privacy, there are several scenes where if there is even one functioning CCTV camera, the movie ends. A pivotal scene in a restaurant is an especially egregious example of this - one grainy image from a camera, and Cecilia can prove she's not going nuts and the whole plot unravels.However, my biggest problem is that what starts as a fascinating study of the lasting ramifications of domestic violence ultimately descends into genre stupidity, with a ridiculously over-the-top final act that says nothing of interest about anything. True, Hollow Man has a pretty over-the-top final act too, but Hollow Man never saw itself as anything other than a schlocky genre affair, whereas The Invisible Man clearly does. The fact that Whannell ultimately undermines himself in this way, deploying such important themes merely to get him to the gory d√©nouement, is especially frustrating insofar as he genuinely did originally seem to have some interesting things to say. Tied to this is that Adrian is introduced as such an abhorrent character from the start, void of nuance or subtlety. Domestic abusers aren't monotone evil-doers, oftentimes, they're very charming on the surface, and any film claiming to be a serious examination of this topic would make room to address this.Although The Invisible Man was very well reviewed and a huge box-office hit, it left me disappointed and frustrated. Initially positioning itself as an insightful allegory for the difficulty victims of domestic abuse have in moving on with their lives even after the abuser is gone, it eventually privileges genre beats and cheap thrills over emotional complexity. Which is a huge shame and a massively missed opportunity."
3,"When you first watch the movie you're thinking okay this is pretty good. Interesting. Starts slow but it builds up and the ending is nice. She gets away with killing the abusive ex boyfriend and lives happily ever after.But after thinking about things for a minute you realize... other than her saying it you don't see any real indication that he did much to her. You are pretty much taking her word for everything. And then when it comes to the boyfriend... what is it about him? You see yeah he can be manipulative but you barely see that. But then you see the main thing the movie is about... the invisible suit and what are they really made for? Who were they made for and how many of those suits did he really have?Then on top of that when you're learning about the boyfriend you learn that he is supposed to be on top of everything. Very observant . And knows what is going on in his place. And especially when it comes to those suits he would know how many he has and what's going on with them. YET when she hides one of those suits that doesn't register in his mind. Like she took the suit off of the dummy, didn't replace it on the dummy in the place... and in fact was attacked moments later. So it should've been known that the suit was missing AND that it would be in the closet or somewhere leading towards the closet since that where she went and yet... nothing.Then there is the scene where her sister gets her throat cut in the middle of a fancy restaurant. And the thing about any eating establishment... there are cameras everywhere. The fancier it is the more cameras there would be. So how is it that they were so sure she killed her sister and didn't spend a single second looking at any of the video footage? Because if they would have spent any time they would have seen a floating knife to notice... something isn't right. But nope somehow all of that was ignored and she was just immediately guilty.And there was the when the daughter got hit while the main girl was down on the ground. Like she's starting to get back up to her feet and is a little distance away. The daughter gets hit and doesn't register that there is no way she could have hit me. Something had to have hit me. Nope. Like if you're on your hands and knees there is no way you're generating enough force to knock someone to the ground and that didn't register with the girl.But yeah its like if you watch the movie and remove your mind from it then its pretty good. But if you start thinking about it you notice things that should've been thought through differently and at least fleshed out a lot more. So that's why the rating went from a near 8 down to a 4. Its just not as good as initially and originally thought."
4,I'm sorry but at times I just don't understand the reviews on this site. There were soooooooo many plot holes it just ruined what other wise could have been a half decent film. I'm afraid that a good film can easily be ruined when the narrative simply doesn't follow and this is one of those cases.
5,"7.5 rating on here I thought this would turn out to be a pretty decent movie. What I got instead was a boring mess. Zero character development, no emotional connection to the main characters to make you care what happens to them. Do yourself a favor and find something else."
6,"What would you do if your abusive ex figured out a way to stalk you without fear of being discovered? That's the conceit at the centre of Leigh Whannell's latest film, The Invisible Man, a nail-biting thriller that has more on its mind than providing simple thrills.Starring Elisabeth Moss as Cecilia Kass, a woman who is rendered helpless in the face of an invisible evil, Whannell spins H.G. Wells classic science fiction novel of the same name into a timely and provocative exploration of psychological abuse.Having escaped from a controlling relationship, Cecilia's rehabilitation is cut short by the sudden intrusion of her ex who has figured out how to regain control over her life without anyone knowing: by becoming invisible.Expertly utilising sci-fi trappings to take gaslighting to a whole new extreme, the film depicts first-hand the anxieties faced by many modern-day survivors of abuse. As Cecilia stresses to those around her that her genius scientist ex has become invisible, we are left conflicted by knowing the truth of her words but also the understanding that, without hard evidence, it's hard to accept her story at face value.By operating in that grey area, The Invisible Man proves the horror genre to be one of the most effective means to reflect modern day anxieties to mass audiences.The trade-off, however, is that by focusing solely on Cecilia's plight, the films feels somewhat underexplained in terms of its villain. Certain actions of his seem straight up superhuman and, without an explanation, it feels as if some logical concessions have been made for dramatic purposes. Granted, to Whannell's credit, he wisely abides by the notion that leaving certain things up to the imagination is better than over explaining to the point of exhaustion.Where so many would-be franchises have failed by focusing too much on setting up sequels, The Invisible Man plays squarely to its strength as a strong, character driven film. Whether it connects to an extended universe remains to be seen, but the film, much like its protagonist, feels much stronger standing on its own."
7,"Mediocre thriller filled with illogical plot holes. The first third of the movie is marginally alright. After it transitions into a sci fi comedy, with the main protagonist playing John Wick, while the main antagonist plays an inverse Bruce Wayne. In this fictional universe, security guards are apparently trained at a bakery. Cameras make no sound whatsoever. Are amazingly waterproof and stain-phobic. Not even paint can stain those. Little girls have a 6th sense for rape and murder. The penetration of a can of pepper spray is equal to that of a cannon ball. Physical objects are ephemeral in nature when it comes to rain drops hitting them. I mean, god damn, i need to get me a set od those god like cameras. And Nat Geo should too, probably.This movie is not even good for making fun of, if you wish to watch a dumb movie with your friends and have a good time - go watch As Above So Below."
8,"The guy puts on a suit, becomes invisible to irritate his wife. So there's no ghost but a man in suit. Then how did he commute? He's covering long distances to follow her everywhere. How is that possible for an invisible guy? Is he driving - but there was no sign of his car? If brother is driving him around - Where is his car too? Is nobody noticing a car with no driver?
It would be so easy for a crazy guy like him being invisible to tie her down one night, throw in his car & take her away instead of playing with her quilts.
In one scene, she got hold of another suit which she could wear & become invisible herself. Won't that make more sense?
But she locked it in house & ran back only to come back later for then end stunt.
One more point - roads have CCTV but not a hospital. Howcome receptionists don't see anything or call 911.
Very unthoughtful movie."
9,I can't begin to convey how bad this thing is. Elisabeth Moss spends the entire movie looking like she has to use the bathroom. The scenes are too long and the music is way too loud and overwhelming. Bottom lime is Hollywood makes another reboot that stinks up the joint. Total waste of time. Can't hold a candle to the original. Make this movie invisible!
10,"The Invisible Man ... hmmmm. Well, it wasn't awful, but it wasn't great. I still don't understand what house she went to, her relationship with the two people that live there, and why it never occurs to her to use the camera on her phone to record video for evidence.In today's world, films really need to go out of their way to explain a LACK of smartphone use. They are so prevalent that NOT using them is a plot hole, and not a small one. It really kind of irritates me.There is one legit good jump scare and some good tense moments. But for the most part it just feels like a real wasted opportunity.I hate to say it, but Hollow Man did it better."
11,"Immerse yourself in a not uncommon story of a women fighting an aggressive and violent male predator, where the assaults can come out of the blue and for little or no reason or justification. Outstanding lead from Elisabeth Moss in a genuinely suspenseful piece of cinema with a refreshing perspective on a tried and tested theme."
12,"A woman furtively leaves her marital bed at dead of night in a hill-top, bay-view, hi-tech luxury mansion. She gets away from her soon-pursuing husband by the skin of her teeth and we soon learn in the aftermath that said husband was a control-freak, obsessively watching her every move. And if you look carefully, also that he's seriously into optics and the like, remember that, it's important. Next thing, she's told by hubby's lawyer brother that he's been killed and she's been left his fortune. So she moves in with her cop pal and his college-age daughter and in relief, starts splashing the cash, but somehow she just can't shake the feeling that her old man is still around and actually isn't dead at all.From this set-up, the film could really have gone one of two or three ways, either as a realistically presented psychological thriller with her out-of-sight ex using his power and influence to disrupt her life while keeping well away from her, or even as a study in paranoia with the wife suffering some kind of breakdown and just imagining all the crazy things happening to her. Or, it could of course go the full H.G. Wells and set the psycho-spouse up as a mirror-suited (remember what I said about his interest in all things optical?) killing-machine, rendering him invisible, out to get her back under his control which plan he puts into motion by firstly framing her for the murder of her own sister just for starters, as you would. Guess which way it goes?So sure enough we get all the cliched, seen-'em-before silly-looking scenes of people fighting and getting beating up by an invisible enemy and lots of static, subjective camera-shots looking at inanimate objects and inviting the viewer to join the connecting dots.Elisabeth Moss as the persecuted wife, gets to bring out her scared, angry and mad faces as the body count increases and the situations become even more ridiculous and predictable. Not that she takes all the mayhem happening around her lying down, oh no, she sure enough overcomes her terror, finds her inner Sarah Connor and decides to fight back leading to a final reckoning back at their old house. For me, she does a good job of staying in character without once breaking out into fits of laughter at all that's going on, especially when her stalker turns out to resemble a now-you-see-him, now-you-don't super-villain running around in a costume that, when revealed, makes him look like a shiny Spider Man.I just found it all very predictable, weakly-characterised, mildly absurd film entertainment. For one thing, I thought the editing poor with jumps to scenes with little or no explanation. Once I sussed how the film was playing all the carefully arranged attempts at dramatic tension evaporated so that I couldn't even be bothered to shout ""He's behind, in front of, to the left or right of you or wherever he was!"" at the screen.Sorry, with its transparent characters and see-through narrative, I just couldn't see what all the fuss was about here."
13,"It honestly makes me sad that we live in an era where a poorly written screenplay like this gets such high praise. I don't even know where to begin to express how bad this film was. I wanted to walk out with 30 minutes left and I never do that. Just when you think the pain is going to end and the movie is over, there is an additional 4th act to add to the absurdity!The lead does a decent job acting in this film but hard to not get a bunch of filth on you in the process.Honestly, do we live in an era where people have stopped thinking and just want to go to a film and zone out and not require it to be good anymore or have a good story?Stay away from this trash."
14,"I gritted my teeth the whole way through this. Being unfamiliar with the lead actress I had no frame of reference. However after nearly 2 hours of her 10 foot high head gurning at me I was traumatised. I genuinely don't understand the reviews for her acting. Like I say I have no idea who she is but good God.
Apart from her character's unbelievable stupidity and awkwardness, I couldn't understand the relationship between her and her controlling husband. We were just told everything. There was no discovery. From her well-planned escape that basically consisted of her being completely unprepared, changing her clothes in the house, completely forgetting she had an enormous dog, the awkwardness of her bumping into things no one at the rendezvous, I was driven mental within the first 10 minutes.
There was no descent into madness. The audience could have been given one iota of respect and offered the possibility that there was in fact no invisible man. Instead there was screaming and shouting and blubbering. Right up to the very end I got no sense of being drawn into any real story.
For me the massive carbuncle in the plot was the finding of the second suit and her hiding it in the place that he actually found her. Surely he must have noticed that it was missing? I mean it was a massive suit and the only place that she could have hidden it was where she was eh, hiding. Let's forget about the fight in the corridor where she was literally lying beside a gun screaming and neglected to pick it up.In conclusion I avoided trailers for this. I was assured by several outstanding reviews that this was fabulous and terrifying. It was neither. The reviewers were unfamiliar with true horror films probably because judging by some of the language I read, none of them had ever been to one.
A final note. Giant close-ups of actors' faces deliberately lit to show bad skin may be ""woke"" but it put me off my massive insipid hotdog."
15,"First of all, let me start with how excited I was to see this movie. Luckily, I got to catch this in an advanced preview. And I will say this, the excitement, counting of days, posting on social media, all paid off.This movie definitely scares you. It's not just jumpscares or loud noises, it's something psychological. From the first opening shot, you're immediately put inside Elisabeth Moss' character Cecilia's head. She is stuck in an abusive relationship and can't get out of it. The whole opening scene makes you uncomfortable as we see Cecilia trying to make her escape. This kind of tension is kept on throughout the film.Another thing this film succeeds upon is the writing. The story progresses in a fast paced way which doesn't seem hurried. The 2hr runtime feels achieved. There's definitely more than one 'WTF' moment in this film to keep you on the edge of your seat.The score and the sound design definitely puts you in Cecilia's shoes as you struggle with her to point out where exactly the invisible man might be. The camera work is exquisite, I mean did we really doubt the director who brought us Upgrade? The action sequences definitely feel thrilling and the way it's shot makes you feel like you're living it.In my book, Elisabeth Moss can do no wrong. Her acting here is definitely something to be noted. From her being hysterically scared to her fighting back, Moss sells it. She makes us root for her. Oliver Jackson Cohen, who plays her abusive husband has a small but really pivotal role and boy o boy he is scary. The rest of supporting cast is also really good. Overall, this is Moss' movie and she carries it with ease.This year (so far) there hasn't been many horror movies that genuinely gave me anxiety or made me jump. So I am happy this film succeeded in doing both. Leigh Whanell is an amazing horror writer/director and proves that he can still give us a solid entertaining flick.There's some solid moments of blood so gorehounds can rejoice.I thought about it a lot and I can't really think of anything that didn't work. Some of you might complain about the camera work and how it focuses on the actor's faces more than the action but to me that worked. I think that definitely sold the drama.All and all this was a terrific film, really made the universal monster scary by mixing the monster with a relevant story. I will give this film a 9/10.If you liked this review please like my page Let's Talk Horror."
16,"An interesting modern take on the invisible man concept in this twisted mind game nightmare yet it comes with the lack of the invisible man presence! An abused wife escapes her narcissist and sadistic husband to her friend's house only to know after a couple of weeks that he committed suicide, in what seems like a happy ending for her turns out to be hell as she feels her husband's presence around here almost everywhere which leads her to suspect that he's still alive and won't let her go this easy.So far the idea sounds interesting but for a general thriller, not revival of a classic, I believe the plot should've been approached with more of a homage to the classic adaption. I know the idea of taking chemical potions to become invisible is over used but a plot mix between modern technology and past methods would've been a better choice, I already have couple of ideas on how to do so just by writing this.Elisabeth Moss carries the movie well, yet the movie feels more like ""The Invisible Man's Wife"" story more than being The Invisible Man story! Practically almost the whole movie is focused on the wife, her mental suffering and what she's going through, you can barley see/sense any character development or acting from the invisible man at all. Some scenes are very predictable like you can almost see through but it's a nice piece of a (general thriller) for the most part."
17,"This movie which they are calling a modern day reboot of the 1933 classic took a scary and tragic character and made him a one-dimensional jump scare. In the 2020 film the Invisible Man uses his invisibility to stalk and terrorize his ex which is scary for her and anybody who wants to help her but does not really fill me with any sense of dread. Now the 1933 Invisible Man he killed at random and most of the time he killed people he didn't even know. A police chief, a couple of people out trying to find him he pushed them off a cliff and he even caused a train to derail killing who knows how many innocent people.Next we come to character himself in the 2020 film he is just a one dimensional abusive boyfriend pretty who is given no character development. Now in the 1933 film the Invisible Man he was once a good kind gentle man who truly loved his girlfriend but the drugs he took to make himself invisible gradually drive him insane and transform him into a homicidal killer. And thus there is the tragedy of the 1933 character a once good man turned evil.And finally we come to last disappointment the means by which they achieve invisibility in the 2020 movie it is a suit which means anyone can put it on and become invisible or make copies of it and create a whole armies of invisible people.Also since it is a suit he can just take it off whenever he wants and be visible again. In the 1933 film it is a chemical formula that only he knows meaning he can be the only invisible one in the story and he as no way of becoming visible again in the movie he was trying to to cure his invisibility but eventually the madness from the drugs overtook him. And once again this makes him a tragic figure.So there you go you have a scary but still tragic character vs. a non-scary one-dimensional character which one would you want to watch?"
18,"Very poor. slow and tedious.
how this film has received a score in the 7+ range is beyond me.
i'm starting to believe that some of the ratings on imdb are faked
and probably placed by a bot."
19,"Leigh Whannell is not a subtle filmmaker - at least, that's what I used to think. The Saw and Insidious movies are over-the-top and shocking, which is fine, and I enjoyed Upgrade quite a bit, but I was afraid the Invisible Man would fall into the same trap of shock-value over substance. Thankfully, I was wrong.From the opening scene, the movie sucks you in with tension and unease. Cecilia (Elizabeth Moss) is trying to escape from her abusive boyfriend while he is asleep, and with practically no dialogue or exposition, we immediately understand the situation and feel for Moss' character. She's trapped in an abusive relationship and fears for her life. It's a testament to Whannell's deliberate direction, using visual cues to give us the information we need while slowly ratcheting up the suspense. The movie is not reliant on jump scares. There are a few, but they're 100% earned and actually effective because we care about the characters. The excellent score helps add to the atmosphere, alternating between pulsating ambience and melancholy orchestral bits.From the concise writing, likable characters, clever directing, a powerhouse lead performance, and a genuinely scary villain, The Invisible Man gets just about everything right. I suppose you could nitpick some of the logic, but that's missing the point. It's a film about gaining freedom from a toxic relationship, and Whannell knows exactly how to pace the story so that we don't spend too much time dwelling on potential plot holes. Overall, a gripping and expertly crafted psychological thriller."
20,"Slow start, slow middle, slow ending. Even the attempt at throwing in a twist couldn't help this movie. I haven't been that bored watching a movie in super long time."
21,"This is a film about an abusive relationship and what is does to the tormented, well... except it's not. Around halfway through the story turns away from a suspenceful psychological thriller and shapes itself into a rather generic, mainstream, twisty and predictable piece.After seeing this I thought the movie works because of Elisabeth Moss's work as lead actress. Her Cecilia is present in almost evey scene and her acting range, her connection to the character and her talent is what elevates this film a couple steps above your typical low-budget thriller. Also speaking of budget, the film is VERY good looking for just a 7 million. I've had some fun with this, I wish it could have gone a different path but it's what it is I guess."
22,"I loved this movie so much. I loved Elisabeth Moss's performance if her acting didn't work then we wouldn't believe there is an invisible man but she sells it. I like the cinematography in the movie, I love it when they move the camera to a random spot in the room and we think the invisible man is there and them kinda showing he's somewhere in the room with her, which creates a lot of tension in the scenes. I love the tension in each scene and they do a very good job of capturing tension throughout the whole movie. They have an absolutely stacked cast and they all do an amazing job. I think they did a pretty job at the score it really worked in the tension of the scenes and it elevated each scene and the whole movie and it flowed with each scene it never felt off at all. I felt so bad for the character of Elisabeth Moss because the evidence is right there and the doctors aren't believing her, and everything that happens to her too. They do an amazing job at fleshing out the character of James who is played by Aldis Hodge he also does an amazing job and I cared about him so much throughout the whole story. The story kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish, and it kept me wanting to learn more or see what was going to happen next. I only have two problems with the movie a bit of the dialogue is bad at times and there are times where the decisions that were made were not logical at all besides that I think it is pretty good. Overall I loved it and would recommend it to anyone."
23,"Read the reviews here before heading to the movie. Walked out after 30 minutes. I mean seriously, Moss in the lead role? No explanation who are the characters Moss went to live with. She is as expressive as Mona Lisa. How can this movie be so highly rated here? I feel cheated with my hard earned money."
24,"The main character was beyond stupid In this whole movie
Time and time again
She kept not doing things
That made the whole movie frustrating to watch
I won't spoil anything on what those things were
But this movie was painful
I have no clue why it's rated so well
And how people got enjoyment out of this crapI will never tell someone not to watch something
But I certainly won't say I enjoyed itThere were a few scenes that were cool
And the Concept of things was intriguing
But not enough to save the film"
25,"Good story plot and a well direction makes this movie watchable till the end with suspense even some flaws having with. A woman flees away from her hubby due to avoid motherhood. Later she came to know that he died but he is haunting her still invisibly. What is the end ? You have to watch this suspense and science fiction thriller. However there is no explanation about invisible suit then one can confused. But movie is watchable. Acting by leading lady is perfect makes you linking the movie. Movie theme based on looks like some bollywood movies i.e. Do gaz zameen ke neeche, Main zaroor aunga, Agni sakshi, Darar and hollywood like Sleeping with enemy etc but in different and better way. Must watchable."
26,WHANNELL has been in my opinion one of the most underrated director /writers for a long time. He was mostly behind the insidious and saw franchises And came out with the spectacular futuristic thriller upgrade in 2018. His brilliant style is once again back with full force in this new adaptation of the invisible man. many people will just look at this like another Blum house manufactured film at first but realize that just because it has the production name on it doesn't mean it will be another throwaway film. This film much like upgrade thrives with a crisp smart script and fantastic visuals. Whannell has a keen eye for detail and it shows in bunches in this film. Elizabeth Moss also gives a phenomenally dedicated performance And sheds emotion throughout. There are many moments in this vicious film that you will not see coming and I was actually surprised by the amount of brutality which serves the overall story well. This is a new take on a classic universal monster that you will not want to miss and it's definitely worthy of going to see in the theater unlike many films of late.
27,"It is a deep mystery for me how this movie reached a score of 7.4. The idea might be interesting, but the action is so slow and most of the scenes are empty. In the very few moments that something is actually happening, it is all theatrical and expected. The whole movie represents a series of unfortunate decisions."
28,"I just got back from a nearly empty theater in order to see this, and I wish I hadn't paid. I don't even wish I'd illegally downloaded it, I wish it were never made so I was never tempted to see it. Hollow Man was better, and that's a sad statement. Who in the hell is rating this positively? There was no 'there' there. No backstory on ANY of the characters, not a single memorable line delivered, and not even an explanation for the so called science fiction aspect of this. On top of that a highly unbelievable story about domestic violence in which we are to believe that a handsome, rich genius is somehow in love with and obsessed with Elizabeth Moss of all people. Leave her to the Handmaid's Tale, she is not meant to be a romantic interest. She got lucky on this because of her origins. Her acting was the usual. I get it, this is supposed to be a horror, but it wasn't even that. Just typical 'made ya flinch!' moments that weren't even that because it was so gosh darn predictable. The positive ratings must be from people who were just glad for the diversity and glad to see yet another white guy cast as a villian (which gets no explanation at all, not even a flashback to what he did that was so horrible. To the point where at the end you can't even be sure he was a villian at all). I was sure a woman wrote this at the end, but I was disappointed to see it was the guy who did Saw. That was at least entertaining. This was embarrassing.Shame on all of you who voted this up. We shall get more of the same as Idiocracy becomes more of a documentary than a ridiculous fiction movie."
29,"I haven't really seen an Invisible Man movie that I could say was good. So I had low expectations walking in.The one with Chevy Chase was horrible. The one with Kevin Bacon was tolerable... but I wouldn't say it was particularly good. This one, however, was awful.But at least it hit all the tropes... not sci-fi/horror tropes, but it hit all the political tropes. And, honestly, I got sick of political lectures in my entertainment about four years ago and they are only getting worse. Movies like this are made to be escapism, if I wanted to see a political film, I'd watch one that overtly claims to be a political film.Movies like this also rely on tension and scares. And tension needs to be built through atmosphere. It needs to be built through character and story, and if it is done right it can be a slow burner of a film that is still entertaining.There was really no tension here. The characters were created to be political representations of the narrative they were pushing and not real characters. It makes it hard to be invested in the well being of a character when they are just stereotypes.It takes away from the tension.Walking stereotypes of what the Twitter community thinks they should be based on race, gender, and sexuality and not real people. Who can become invested in characters that are stereotypes?It's a situation made worse because the villain isn't ominous and intimidating, he isn't threatening at all. He's the stereotype of what the Twitter community thinks is an Incel... and there is nothing at all threatening about that. Watching him, you get the impression that you could break him down into a basket of tears with nothing more but a harsh word.When the tension is broken, it's with a jump scare. Those are as overdone as the stereotyped political agenda driven characters.When all is said and done, you have a movie without the tension needed to move the film along, you have a movie with stereotyped characters that it's hard to get invested in, you have a movie with a villain that is anything but threatening, and you ultimately have a movie where nothing much happens.But, if you are the type to watch a film with a notebook and writing utensil to record all the points it needs to hit to make it Twitter posse approved... it hits enough of them for high praise.For the rest of us, we'll go back to Chevy Chase and Kevin Bacon and be slightly less disappointed."
30,"Cecilia Kass (Elizabeth Moss) is a woman living in fear. Despite living a life of wealth and privilege in a seaside home; she is ready to take drastic steps in her life.
Cecilia is trying to escape from her controlling and abusive husband who despite being considered a wealthy genius in the field of Optics; has made her life a living hell and forces her to make a daring escape that has her barely getting away with the help of her sister Alice (Harriett Dyer).
The film picks up two weeks later where Cecilia is hiding with a friend of her sister Officer James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Cecilia is scared to even leave the house and do simple tasks such as checking the mailbox and is livid when her sister comes to visit as she is sure that her husband will find her by tracking her Sister.
Alice informs Cecilia that her husband has killed himself and she is now free to live without fear. Cecilia gets a letter informing her that she is to receive 100K a month to the sum of five million dollars as part of her husband's will. The fact that nobody should have her mailing address does seem odd to her as does that fact that the estate is being handled by her ex's brother Tom (Michael Dorman).
With her new wealth Cecilia gifts James and also sets up a school fund for Sydney and begins to emerge from her shell.
It is around this time that unusual things begin to happen to her. A lost item from the night of her escape shows up and a mysterious kitchen fire starts. Cecelia also wakes up to find the covers off the bed and what appears to be something unseen standing on the blankets when she attempts to pull them up.
When she expresses her concerns to James that her husband is alive and exacting revenge, both he and Tom ignore her and when things begin to escalate, Cecilia is the one who starts to look more and more unstable as the tormenting continues and her life spins out of control.The film is Written and Directed by Leigh Whannell who rose to prominence as one of the co-creators of the ""SAW"" franchise. The film is the perfect example of how to do a film of this sort as it is very clever in how it is paced and allows for the suspense to build without relying on many of the standard Horror Film staples.The film is also good about having things happen before it pulls back so it is not an extended series of intense moments but several incidents between the tension and setup.The cast is very good and what is amazing is that the film was made for a $7 million dollar budget yet looks every bit of a major studio film.There are some interesting twists along the way as while I was able to predict two of them; the others were a very nice surprise.
It is so refreshing to see a film like this come along as in many ways it can help redefine the Horror genre and proves that you can make a quality movie that is also scary and intense.I for one hope we see more from this franchise in the near future.4.5 stars out of 5."
31,"This INVISIBLE MAN would have been an excellent thriller bringing fresh suspense and edge-of-your-seat tension to the big screen, but you can hardly enjoy the movie due to the blaring non-human-like responses made by almost every character in each 'frightening' scene. Only one character performed with genuine emotion that truly reflected what was happening onscreen, and that was Sydney Lanier (Storm Reid). Other actors reacted to their circumstances in a totally unrealistic manner. None reflected the type of behavior, reactions, or even reflexes that a normal person would have had in that same situation. This weakness in the screenplay was so blaring, that it was a distraction and greatly subtracted from the positive traits of the movie.Here are just a few examples of unrealistic human behavior that did not reflect how a normal person would have acted in that scenario. WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD!1. Cecilia has taken EXTREME measures to meticulously plan her middle of the night escape from her dangerous husband, in Mission Impossible fashion, down to the very last evasive detail. Yet when she gets to the very last step of her escape, instead of simply walking out of the open garage door, she decides to stop and talk to the large family dog and waste time trying to remove its tightly latched proximity collar, which results in the dog bumping the car and activating the noisy car alarm. NO REASONABLE PERSON TRYING TO ESCAPE WITH THEIR LIFE WOULD HAVE DONE THAT.2. Cecilia is in the house alone in the kitchen, and thinks she hears a noise, and turns around to notice the front door chain has been removed and the front door is wide open. It is freezing cold outside. So what does she do? She takes a short stroll outside the mysteriously wide-open door and just stands there like she is about to take a smoke break or something. NO REASONABLE PERSON WOULD HAVE JUST STROLLED BLINDLY OUTSIDE INTO DANGER WITH THE DOOR WIDE OPEN. (This scene was obviously just written that way so they could show the invisible man's breath in the cold air.)3. Cecilia hears the sound of Adrian's vibrating phone coming from the attic and she decides to climb up the ladder to investigate the dark attic...by herself...WITHOUT CALLING ANYONE ELSE FOR HELP BEFORE GOING UP.4. While in the attic, she finds his phone, and a butcher knife, and a set of keys. She then suspects the invisible man is waiting below on the ladder, so she tosses a can of paint downward and terrifyingly discovers that he is. She then, with two phones available, decides to jump down out of the attic to the floor, and try to pursue the invisible man with the butcher knife...INSTEAD OF TRYING TO CALL FOR HELP FROM THE SAFETY OF THE ATTIC WITH ONE OF THE TWO PHONES IN HER HANDS.5. Cecilia visits her sister to discover that someone has sent her sister an ugly email and made it look like it came from Cecilia. Her sister accuses her and slams the door in her face. She spends only about 2.5 seconds trying to defend herself, and then just leaves. NO REASONABLE PERSON WOULD HAVE LEFT WITHOUT INSISTING THE EMAIL DIDN'T COME FROM THEM.6. When she gets home, she logs in to her laptop and reads the ugly email that was sent to her sister. She breaks down crying and lies on the floor for hours. SHE MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO CALL HER SISTER AND PLEAD HER INNOCENCE.7. While Cecilia and her sister are sitting in the restaurant talking, a butcher knife begins to float in mid-air next to Cecilia's head. The sister sees it and just sits there watching the floating knife and NEVER REACTS TO IT OR SAYS A WORD ABOUT IT.8. After the invisible man murders Cecilia's sister with the butcher knife, he immediately places the bloody knife in Cecilia's right hand. SHE NEVER TRIES TO DROP THE KNIFE OR LET IT GO, OR MOVE AT ALL! SHE JUST HOLDS IT FOR ABOUT 45 SECONDS, LONG ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE IN THE RESTAURANT TO SEE IT AND THINK SHE KILLED HER OWN SISTER.9. WHAT RESTAURANT ON EARTH PROVIDES A GIANT BUTCHER KNIFE AT THE TABLE instead of a steak knife or dinner knife?? THEY HADN'T EVEN ORDERED ANY FOOD!10. When Cecilia is in the hallway at the mental hospital struggling with the police officers, the invisible man attacks and injures 4 police officers. Officer number 5 runs up on the scene, after having witnessed officers 3 and 4 being literally knocked around by some invisible force, AND HE DECIDES TO JUST STAND THERE AND POINT HIS GUN WAY DOWN THE HALL AT CECILIA, WHILE YELLING ""STAY DOWN CECILIA"" 7 TIMES???11. At the mental hospital, Cecilia attempts suicide by jabbing a sharp pen into her wrist, and then pulling in downward, tearing the veins. After that... NO BLOOD? NO AGONY? NO MEDICAL EMERGENCY? NO NO DYING? WAS SHE ACTUALLY A CYBORG??12. At least 10 characters throughout the movie are physically assaulted by this invisible assailant, and these people just stand there and stare into blank space. NOBODY YELLS, SCREAMS, PANICS, OR CRIES FOR HELP DURING THE ATTACKS?? ARE THESE PEOPLE EVEN HUMAN??The list goes on and on, but I believe this is enough to show you the frustrating 2-hour pattern on unrealistic human behavior that ruins this movie experience. The INVISIBLE MAN would have been so much better if the characters had at least reacted to their circumstances with genuine emotions or reflexes that any reasonable person would have shown."
32,"Here's my review of the new ""The Invisible Man"" movie for those who care...Hollywood Producer: ""Hey guys, as we know, reboots are all the rage right now. So we'd like to do a remake of Julia Roberts' Sleeping With The Enemy movie from 1991. Any ideas?""Hollywood Writers: ""What if we made the husband crazy AND invisible this time?""Hollywood Producer: ""GENIUS!! Let's get to work!!"""
33,I went into this thinking it would be rubbish I was wrong twists and turns through out great film
34,"I mean, last one was bad, but this just simplistic explo b-movie inflated for 2 hours long. And wow! What a script! So they say this rubber bdsm suite grunt ability to super strength or what? And no, fem-bots You cant mark this as a spoiler, because suite was in trailer and NOT super strength not a real twist. But cheap chooses was."
35,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years. I dont understand the good reviews, I saw the trailer and got excited, I read the reviews and I got even more excited.. I saw the movie and Jesus, not scary at all and the story was just bad.. This is a sci-fi, not a horror movie.."
36,"""He said that wherever I went, he would find me, walk right up to me, and I wouldn't be able to see him.""I probably yawned and rolled my eyes when I first heard they were rebooting The Invisible Man. This idea had been done and done and done...right? Wrong! Director Leigh Whannell breathes new life into the concept. Now it's a vehicle for Elisabeth Moss, as Cecilia, who is in every scene and steals them all.Sound and vision are used to keep you on edge. Is Cecilia suffering a mental breakdown because of her abuse...or is there an invisible man following her? Moss and Whannell squeeze every ounce out of this scenario and it all works. This movie even sidesteps the science missteps of earlier versions with an updated version of the character. Though very different from the book by H.G. Wells, I feel like he would approve."
37,"This movie is no exception to the modern trend where political agendas are shoved down our throats, a trend that has become the norm these days. All white male characters are bad, women and black people are depicted as moral, brave and victimized (the only neutral white male in this movie is the only briefly introduced uber driver). Under these constraints, non of the characters has enough depth that makes them relateable, or at least allows you to understand the logic behind actions they take and their interactions throughout the movie. The dialog are non-realistic, not interesting, and lack any sophistication. Also the movie lacks any sense of humor, there is nothing here except some shallow sarcastic comments you would expect from a rebellion teen-age girl.The whole movie is written around a white male villain (almost a super-villain), Adrian, that tries to control and manipulate the poor woman protagonist, Cecilia, using his superior intellect. We only know anything about him through the depictions of the protagonist. He is reflected as an abstract representation of toxic masculinity traits such as an egocentric peruse of power and dominance. Although in reality long-term relationships are complex, her depictions of him are so horrific, so one-sided, that you don't really understand why they were together in the first place.The motives of Adrian is an enigma to the viewer. He is a genius, both in the academic and social sense, he is a young and rich, yet, he is obsessively fixed on this non-interesting, not very attractive woman, that does not want to bear his children (probably serving to negate the cultural notion that women's function is merely to bear children). He needs HER so much, that he would go as far as to fake his own death, murder people, and basically go through this overly complicated plan just so that he could again control her and make her life miserable. It would perhaps help if we could understand what makes this woman worthy of risking everything, but her greatness is only conveyed to us by him.Reputation by others is a reoccurring theme in this movie, and is a reflection of lazy writing. Instead of building the characters ground-up through their actions, we are told about them: how much the antagonist is bad, the protagonist is good. The protagonist's sister Emily is praised by her, but all we see is an un-witty sarcastic  that doe's not believe, nor tries to help sister in any way. This fake artificial empowerment is yet another politically correct era characteristic.Even beyond the ridicules series of unrealistic over-complicated science-fiction events, the movie is ripe with plot hols: how is it that you could injure yourself with a pen in a mental institute (and be completely fine afterwards), how does Tom know what Cecilia was going to do with the money, how did she managed to get the invisibility suit so quickly before she kills him, etc.In the end of the movie, a pseudo-sophisticated plot twist is revealed when it turns out Tom, the brother of the evil antagonist is helping him. This, like many other things, does not make any sense, as we could barely even understand the antagonist motive.The movie manages to scare you, but mostly through cheap jump scares, accompanied by loud annoying sounds. The soundtrack as a whole is nothing too memorable, nor pleasant to the ear, although this is largely expected from a horror film. To be fair, the action sequences are enjoyable and the suite is cool."
38,"If we could find something in the main character to care about,we might be able to overlook how incredibly slow and boring this film is. Save your money. It finally starts something after one dull hour."
39,This has been my favorite movie this year as far as 2020 goes!
40,"Well, that was a heap of crapüí© I am a big fan of quality horror/thriller but this was bad.
Angry that I had to sit through it."
41,"Very bad and unrealistic. The girl who was so afraid of the ""abuser"" that she couldn't speak or move or breathe in his presence in the beginning ,in the end transformed into the assassin without emotion or fear. And she transformed in literally one second. The film didn't show any character development ,she just happened to be an alien who can turn off her emotions."
42,"This is the worst movie that I have seen in a long time ,Don't waste time and money watching that boring nonsense movie !!"
43,"It's like all white men are gang raping women beaters or something I'm sick of it. The 1933 is a classic movie with legendary actors like Claude Rains.....this movie is trash, bad script writing and terrible acting. No background to the characters history. It's like ten feminists sat around a table and figured out the best way to cost the studio money. Honestly folks, this movie is an insult. #getwokegobroke"
44,"This is like a mash-up of a bad Lifetime Network movie about a crazy ex, and someone's loose interpretation of Hollow Man. It pales in comparison to the original 1933 classic - and even Hollow Man itself! It's very anti-white male and is just ridiculous nonsense all around. The main character and her best friend make THE dumbest decisions constantly and the movie is loaded to the gills with jump-scares.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR TIME.Rent Hollow Man if you haven't seen it. If you want to see a MUCH better crazy ex movie, see 'Sleeping With The Enemy' with Julia Roberts."
45,"Another stupid 'man bad' woke-fest. Her mousy character just became so tedious annoying and I had to switch this off. There's nothing wrong with a character being vulnerable and mousy but, when they can't even make the simplest rational remark to defend themselves (because of terrible writing and bad directing) it just gets completely unrealistic, ridiculous, and to me, unwatchable.I still gave it a 5 because the acting is very good but, the writers need to be replaced. In fact the whole of the Hollywood film industry needs to replaced with normal writers who just want to make great movies and entertain people instead of running a corrupt and immature political and social agenda."
46,"First of all i pity the main actor. He's the main actor but his screen time is less than 10mind throughout the entire movie? Even the sidekick sydney has more screen time.Movie is low budget. Actor is invisible.Alot of scenes that doesnt make sense. Like actress ""conveniently"" finds a pail of paint to splash onto the actor.And please. The actress is not even pretty. Why the actor so persistent in having her?Reason why i use the term actor and actress? Cuz i clearly dont remember their names and cant be bothered to.Its a lousy movie. Spoilt my childhood story."
47,"I've just finished watching this and I'm very pleased I watched it for free. Unfortunately I still feel like the movie stole from me, it stole my time.The movie starts with a character inexplicably drugging her boyfriend and running away from a luxurious home. Plenty of hapless things happen but alas the female lead isn't caught by the boyfriend who smashes a car window (why?). We don't get much in terms of what the relationship was like until later and it's a one sided argument.We cut to a scene in which we're informed the boyfriend has died and has committed suicide. This is one part of the script that leaves a major plot hole for later on. The boyfriend in his will, gives everything to his now ex girlfriend but sets up a task, she can't commit any crimes otherwise she doesn't get the money. This again creates a massive plot hole later.Following this, we get the standard hijinks of the invisible man trying to drive her insane and this is honestly the best part of the movie. The way the female lead is manipulated and appears to commit crimes like child abuse and murder should be enough for our female lead to go away and for the invisible man to have his vengeance. End movie. Perfection.But no. This is the moment of the #metoo era and we can't have that. The brother of the now apparently deceased man comes to the psychiatric facility and tells our female lead that she's pregnant (incredibly this is actually in the movie). This is where the movie begins to unravel and started to go massively off course on the whim of someone who realized the patriarchy must come down.The aforementioned brother is only short of twirling his little moustache like Dick Dastardly and at this point the audience know he's in on the game. The same lawyer brother produces pictures of his dead rich intelligent brother to the female lead and shows her an urn. Apparently there was no funeral, no other family members, no identification of the body and no police investigating the alleged suicide. Of course we could concoct a theory that the brothers made this all up but wouldn't female leads police friend research this whilst female lead was in his home acting crazy? NOPE.The movie then has lawyer brother whisper that she keep the baby and go back to the not dead but alive rich brother who's using a suit made of cameras, this idea was likely stolen from predator and it's a clever idea but the idea then has a massive problem later which results in an ending that can be seen a mile away. So we have our sharp pen and female lead sort of tries to slit her wrists and begins to succeed until our invisible man grabs her arm to stop her. This begins the real suspension of disbelief. The woman losing blood from her wrists over powers the invisible man whom she cannot see and begins to stab him whilst he stands there allowing himself to be stabbed. At this point the cameras are starting to break down and glitch.We then get a scene in which the invisible man wreaks havoc and murders everyone of the guards that see him phase in and out. Here we go, this is the end, the invisible man wins, the female lead is framed to not only have killed her sister, beat a child and single handedly murdered an entire security staff but she'll be basically strapped down now, convicted and the baby will be born and our invisible man has an understudy. Knock knock #metoo is back. The invisible man then begins to run away but only far enough for our female lead to catch up constantly, he could knock her out at any point or shoot her or do any amount of things but he only runs away a little bit. Tediously they get outside, equipment still on the fritz but our female lead is in chase but now has a gun that invisible man kind of kicked towards her. Unbelievable.The invisible man springs out of nowhere lifts her up and gives another ominous threat whilst taking out two more security guards. Again he kicks a gun within grabbing distance instead of picking it up and runs away to a car. Bare in mind whilst the equipment is on the fritz he could just go somewhere into the forest or surrounding area and hide and wait until security grab our female lead but no, he gets into a car and drives away. Our female lead causes a car collision and steals a car. Add grand theft auto to the list of crimes committed.With equipment half working our invisible man decides to attack our kind of cop friend's daughter. He beats our kind of cop up but doesn't hear our female lead run in with a fire extinguisher (where'd that come from?) And then proceeds to allow himself to be shot. Hapless.Our movie ends with the apparently dead rich brother tucked away behind a wall like a Scooby Doo villain saying I didn't do any of this and the cops go alright. What's maddeningly bad is our female lead isn't in the psychiatric hospital or in jail for various crimes committed including murder but is now walking around free.Cut to our female lead wearing a wire to the exes house to get him to say he did it. What follows is truly stupid. Earlier in the movie female lead is caught removing the camera suit so we have two available suits that we know of. Brother has one and dead boyfriend has the other. So if lawyer brother is now shot then that leaves one unaccounted for suit right? Well dead boyfriend says one word and female lead goes to the bathroom. Incredibly in that amount of time she allegedly walks back out in the suit and helps him cut his own throat and then appears very quickly without the suit on to pretend to be upset. She leaves the home with the suit and tells kind of cop to basically leave her alone now.What baffles me most is how characters refer to female lead as beautiful and the ex boyfriend apparently clings to someone that looks like Elizabeth moss in spite of all his wealth and him clearly being the far better looking half by a large distance, that's truly unbelievable.If I could give this trash 0 I would have."
48,.The Invisible Man has a suit...but it also gives him superhuman strength? He can go anywhere the plot needs him to go? He faked his death but he left an invisible suit in the basement of his house and when she goes and steals he does not notice? Huh? He can be inside of her jail cell? WHAT? He can fight off and kill multiple police officers? With what strength? I thought he was a scientist? The woman actress is annoying. She knows her ex is in her house and doesn't go elsewhere? Stupid. The ending of this movie is dumb too.
49,"Predictable as hell, simplistic plot, main actress that can't act, some of the worst dialogue I've seen on the big screen - forced, awkward, artificial..."
50,With the pandemic I think studios released the movies they were not in love with and are still holding on to their best movies for later this year or the beginning of next year. There was an abundance to stream but The Invisible Man was one of the few movies I thought was actually good.Elisabeth Moss had an excellent performance. Really making me feel the horror of the situations she was in. The concept was nice. It was executed well with some terrifying scenes. Not just seeing the horror but making you imagine the horror. There were some by the book scenes but the creators also did create some memorable unique scenes. Worth the watch.
51,"...ly stupid. Would be tense moments are exaggerated by lots of loud music or annoying sounds. Apparently, everyone in the audience has to be completely oblivious to the obvious. The movie was over before it began because it assumes the movie goer has no common sense. The detective is dummer than Riggs, Murtaugh or Butters. Evidently the nerd and the lawyer are both former SEALs, MMA veterans and good friends of Tony Stark. Only recent movie that was worse was Holms & Watson. I would rate negative stars, but alas thats not an option."
52,"This version of ""The Invisible Man"" is filmed in Sydney, Australia but is supposed to take place in San Francisco. That explains why most of the action takes place in building interiors, dark streets and parking lots. The villain is a rich white guy. There is a black guy, a cop, but he mostly stands around like a potted plant, acting as if he forgot his lines. The rich guy's girlfriend is the star of the movie and her cardboard role is played listlessly by Elizabeth Moss, an actress who needs a good director and a better script. Along the way, there are some fight scenes involving a visible person and the invisible man. The fights look like amateur night. There are about 30 seconds total of invisibility visual effects and they are miserably done and repeated. It looks like most of the film's budget was spent on salaries for the producers. The movie's director seems to be a big fan of Terminator 2, he borrowed everything he could from that James Cameron movie. Except Cameron's talent."
53,This is the worst movie that I have seen in a long time. There are major holes in the plot that just get ignored. Save your time and money and don't waste it by seeing this terrible remake.
54,"The story has tons of holes. Simple logic could be used to solve all of the problems our hero faces but instead. Ya know invisible man. Predictable story can guess what type of movie it is from the preview.
Acting was also really bad. Nothing about this movie made any sense."
55,"A woman escapes an abusive relationship with a wealthy young tech entrepreneur. A short while later he commits suicide. She should now feel free to live her life but she keeps feeling that he is still there, invisibly watching her. Then things start happening which make her think that this is more than just a feeling.Intriguing thriller. Reasonably clever plot and writer-director Leigh Whannell does a good job of gradually building up the tension, slowly feeding the viewer information at first but then ratchetting things up as the film progresses.Looked like it was on course to be brilliant but, having set up this intriguing scenario with some tight direction and script-writing, Whannell lets things slip towards the end. The plot becomes looser and less watertight. There's some unnecessary twists and the ultimately the plot doesn't completely make sense. Having expertly set things up, Whannell doesn't entirely know where to go with it.Still, very intriguing and entertaining."
56,"Its hard for me to find anything good in this movie, no idea if I watched the same one that many people rates 10/10.
But I must say it takes some talent to make a classic tale of invisible man in to boring ""me too"" special snowflake piece of trash.
I have a suggestion - go watch Hollow Man with Kevin Bacon insead. Its much much better."
57,"This is a bastardized version of Wells's creation with a ""me-too"" cupcake thrown in. Some insane woman suffers through the whole 2 hours, but it is unclear why she is suffering and running away from this man (whoever he is). No plot, no cohesive story, just low-class anti-male propaganda. Boring and uninteresting."
58,"The Invisible Man is an incredible psychological horror that's extremely tense, scary and timely. Elisabeth Moss gives an incredible lead performance and both Aldis Hodge and Storm Reid give great supporting performances. Leigh Whannel's direction is incredible, effectively utilising empty spaces to build suspense and using the same style he used for Upgrade for the excellent action sequences. The use of sound is also great and helps build suspense. It's expertly paced and the music by Benjamin Wallfisch is amazing. However, its brought down slightly by one predictable twist."
59,"Just another worthless movie, suggesting men are sadistic and get excitement from terrorizing or mistreating women. Like someone else wrote in their review this man in reality would not even lose a nights sleep over her leaving him, instead he would have took a huge sigh of relief and celebrated the fact she did him a big favor by leaving"
60,"Where to begin with this mess? I'll start with the stock loyal black friend that's their to risk their life for the lead character at a moment's notice. The fact the invisible suit is sound proof, fine you can't see him, but why can't anyone hear 200llb man walking around in the same room as them? Did I miss the part where the suit granted super strength? Why is he, or they, so strong? What material is the suit made of that paint comes off so easily, varnish exists because paint is impossible to get off. Clearly Adrian did it, right? Okay, how did he tie himself up? Where is the grown-out facial hair, bad hygiene, rope burns and other clues that would tell the cops he was really trapped by his brother for weeks? Remember that cool restaurant scene where the sister dies? Watch it again and see where the knife starts and where it ends and then imagine how someone could do that. Also, where did the knife come from, does the suit have pockets? When one of the invisible men is stabbed repeatedly so much that it damages the suit, why does he pop up immediately and feel no pain? Was he Hulking up and no selling? Why does the dog bark at the invisible man, isn't he the owner, the one feeding and taking care of him this entire time? What was the suit made for, the government, the military? Maybe they would want to get their hands on it after he died? Did his company, partners, investors, tech people, any of them have any interest in invisible suits, or did they think once he died the suits died? The suit that Moss hid, how did he not notice it was missing, did he make so many he couldn't keep count? How many armed guards do you need in a mental institute? The young girl is attacked in her bedroom and in the hallway implying that Adrian and his brother were in the house at the same time, so does that mean there was a third invisible man at the hospital? Are these suits one size fits all, because Moss is significantly smaller than the invisible men. What powers these suits, imagination? Finally, the third act was very paint by the numbers down to the suit glitching only when it was convenient for the movie and stopped once the hospital scene was done. This isn't a terrible movie by any stretch, but it is the most nonsensical movie I can remember seeing."
61,The movie is too bad. All the characters especially the main role act like super low IQ people. It was unpleasant for me to watch such horrible movie
62,"This movie should be called the stupid man, I don't understand how this movie got a good rating. I am still in shock that I wasted my time watching this nonsensical, stupid, and non-logical movie. Don't waste your time and money. I will not even rent it for one dollar."
63,"Elizabeth Moss is overrated and her acting & facial expressions were terrible at times in this movie. Wish they casted someone else as a female lead. Other than that, this is a new kind of thriller and can be watched once!"
64,"I was disappointed by the lack of backstory for the characters. They never show what happened in their relationship to make her fear him so much, not even flashbacks. It detracts from the sense of dread you should feel while watching the film. They also failed to flesh out the characters in any real sense. They're two dimensional and uninteresting, so you don't care much what happens to them. Three of us watched this together and no one wanted to be the jerk and come out and say it though we eventually did- Elisabeth Moss was a decent actress in this, but she's really unattractive and hard on the eyes (at least in this role). It was a bit distracting and unbelievable. I'm not saying she shouldn't be cast in roles just because she's not a beauty, but maybe not in a role where a handsome wealthy man is obsessed with her. I can only suspend disbelief so much.
It reminded me of Hollow Man with Kevin Bacon, which was a superior film if I remember right. The Invisible Man is fun though if you're not expecting too much and has some good jump scares."
65,"Nothing to see here. Disjointed and a horrible storyline.
Save yourself the trouble and watch Shrek."
66,"I was very encouraged to see this movie because of the critic response. I could not however reconcile what I was seeing verse what the critics said. The movie was boring, anti-climactic and Unexplained at so many levels. Furthermore, if you were an invisible man would you spend your time harassing some big jaw woman around? Surely, there are better things you can think of to do then to harass some ugly woman if you have the power of invisibility . When it ended, I thought there was still an hour left to go because I didn't see any action. All I can say is, don't believe the critics on this one. The movie must've cost $100 to make and it was totally useless. To think of all they could do in this day and age with an invisible Man movie and this is what they put out. They didn't even bother to use a hot chick in the lead role. Go rent the hollow man because there was really no difference and that movie was actually better even though the critics didn't like it."
67,"Way too many inconsistencies, where does James come from, who is he? In a panic in the streets, an Uber turns up instantly and from nowhere WTF! And in her police interview the boyfriend/friend? Sits in on the interview patently ridiculous! And then knowing what happened and what she's done he then allows her to walk away!? Crazy crazy plot holes!"
68,"I know this is science fiction, but there should be some reality to it. What about the dog. When Cecilia finds out about her husbands death, why doesn't she retrieve the dog??? How can a dog fend for itself? Clumsy writing.
Otherwise pretty good film for its genre. Moss is very good in a demanding and physical role."
69,Total waste of time !! 2 hrs of elisabeth moss looking scared to the left... scared elisabeth moss looking to the right. All good parts were in the trailer !! So disappointed
70,"I was not as overwhelmed as those that gave a rave review. Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) manages to escape her controlling husband Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). Adrian is an expert in optics and founder of Cobolt. After Adrian is reported as dead, weird things begin to happen to her as Cecilia believes Adrian is still alive and invisible.The build-up would have been better if the title didn't give things away. We know what is going on because of it. The film reminded me of a home intruder film with a twist. In ""Hush"" the woman was blind which gives a similar effect. I did enjoy the restaurant scene, didn't see that coming. Too bad the rest of the film was ""B"" horror. Elisabeth Moss does ask the right question, of all the women in the world, ""why me?"" And I never got a good answer to that. Not that there is anything wrong with Moss, I don't see her making my top 10,000 to hang out with while invisible.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
71,"I had high expectations from this, due to Australian Writer/Director of ""Saw"", Leigh Whannell involvement.Unfortunately it's just a twist on the ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" narrative, except with the familiar cruelty tropes you would expect from the ""Saw"" writer.
Once you realise this, an educated guess would make this venture quite predictable. It's a decent viewing, just not matched with the amount of overly positive reviews that fails to meet that expectation."
72,"Some people are calling this movie brilliant. I can't understand why.There are so many plot holes it's ridiculous. My favorite being the paint scene. How's dude gonna wash all that paint off his fancy camera suit that fast? How do we see his breath through the suit? How is moving around so stealthy in a suit made of cameras? Are there cameras on the soles of his feet? Why were those cops so inept at mental hospital? However, the biggest turn off was the rape. The plot could have continued with the same trajectory without it. A solid waste of two hours."
73,"We throw around the descriptor ""Hitchcockian"" far too often...but this is 100% the movie Hitchcock would make if he were alive today. Mysterious psycho, terrified blonde, repressed sexuality, strong use of the cinematic medium, dual strength of suspense in both small & epic spaces. The main difference is that while Hitch would inevitably (& rightly) have been #metoo'd, Invisible Man is basically #timesup in film form, capturing the long-lasting effect of long-term abuse with awe-inspiring & terrifying results."
74,"I had originally thought this was going to be a remake of the old movie, so when I discovered it wasn't, I made the decision not to watch it. A trip to my library and there it was on the shelf, and I thought to myself 'what the heck.' Im glad I did. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, but was frustrated at times. In a world of cameras everywhere, I had a hard time with the murder of Cecelia's sister and also with the ending, where she is able to go to the bathroom, put on the suit, kill Adrian and then remove the suit in the time frame she did all of this. But I think overall it's worth watching."
75,Possibly worst actress I've ever seen topped with boring plot makes it 1/10!
76,"The main actress role was pretty bad, her actuation not convincing, mistake after mistake, so many gestures in her face make her work looking pretty fake and not convincing.
This is the reason why the movie was so bad, because her awful play."
77,"To start off, this is a classic case of horror done right! No cliche jump scares, cheap characters, or over the top gore. This film had amazing characters that you sympathized with. The villian in this film always felt like a presence, even if he was not there, the film made the audience just as paranoid as the lead character. This is a movie that could have been very boring, but I found myself at the edge of my seat the whole time! It was also one of the most beautifully directed films I have seen in a while. This goes up there with the horror classics that rely on tension and suspension, Hitchcock would be proud!"
78,A contrived plot with no one having clear motivation for the atrocious things that they do. And no logical explanation given to a number of things that happens in this film. A BS plot to please the teens and Tweens and the pre-teens.
79,"The Invisible Man (2020) is what happens when a script is completely stripped of any and all subtext, reducing any thematic material to heavy handed dialogue so the audience doesn't have to bother asking questions. It has as much respect for viewers' critical thinking and ability to piece things on their own as it does for James Whale's 1933 masterpiece; which is, to say, none at all. Whale would be spinning in his grave knowing that his Macbethian tale of a small man's descent into madness would be corrupted into this soulless and bland chore with no interesting themes, no interesting characters and no sense of artistry. There's nothing grand or Gothic in its sensibilities at all. It looks and feels just like any generic, boring thriller of the past 14 years, made worse by the fact it's riding the coat tails of one of the great operatic classics of Horror. It's an ugly and dull film, arguably as much as the somehow-superior-but-still-abysmal Tom Cruise Mummy film of 3 years ago.The one shining bright spot here is Elizabeth Moss, who tries her best to give some dimension and nuance to a character that the script defines only through her victimhood and suffering. As she does in everything else I've seen her in, Moss delivers in a harrowing and moving performance reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's Oscar turn in last year's Joker. Much like Phoenix, however, she's given an awful script that doesn't give her much to do but suffer for 2 hours and avenge herself in a rushed manner in the last 10 minutes.I've heard people describe this as a ""fresh"" take on The Invisible Man, and frankly, I fail to see it. This comes off as a better acted and less self aware Hollow Man. A psycho of privilege tortures his desired romantic interest.That's it.Nothing else.All with every line out of Cecelia's mouth spelling this out over and over again to any audience member who might be taking bathroom breaks every 2 minutes.The story is cliched and predictable to a shocking degree, right down to the plot twist that adds absolutely nothing to the story, bits and pieces stapled from better and smarter Horror movies. Nobody involved with this cared about the original Invisible Man. Nobody involved with this cared about honoring a timeless legacy of tragic monsters. It's yet another corporate attempt by Universal to use its Horror films to cash in on the #MeToo movement without having a single genuinely provocative or interesting idea or sincere bone in its body, much in the same manner that the equally abysmal Halloween (2018) and Black Christmas (2019) did. The Invisible Man (2020) isn't just a bad film, it's an insulting one.55 likes"
80,"Whattt?excuse me what???
A technician with mirror expertise?
No doubt, Elizabeth Moss is a great actress but you call that a movie?
In that restaurant scene ,she literally grabbed the knife ,who told you to raise your hand,who told you to twitch your fingers?
The antagonist cut protagonist's friends throat and then made your fingers do that within a split second??
What he's the flash now?Oh my god!Do we watch a movie only for jump scares these days? Are we humans or monkeys? Jumpscares like these makes monkeys laugh with bewilderment ...
Boring Cinematography..
Plot holes everywhere..
And of course nobody believes the protagonists in horror movies so why even showing that to the viewers repeatedly? scenes of investigation takes 30% of the movie
The running scenes takes the 40 % of the whole movie,
No background sound which excites people..Where is the horror?A good entertainment for the monkeys though whoever rated it 5+
Hollywood 1

81,"I absolutely hate scary movies & try to avoid them wherever I can, however, my housemate got free tickets to a preview screening & I can't say no to popcorn.I was so pleased with this film & im so glad I went. This movie was like Gone Girl on crack, it was sooooo good! Kept you on edge majority of the movie & Elizabeth Moss' performance is one to remember. Her acting was so good, even I began to believe she was insane.The music & sound effects are loud af & as always, makes everything ten times scarier than it needs to be but storyline is magnificent & the twists kept coming.And if you hate horrors just like me, the lead up to any jump scares is predictable af so you know when they're coming lmaooo."
82,"I really wanted to like this movie...The trailer looked great. Unfortunately it was not good. The acting was ok by the main character, but thats about it. The black man was not good, he thought he was way too cool for school. I wish we could hire people because of their talent, not for other obvious reasons (color) but thats Hollywood.I love horror/thriller movies but pass on this one...wait for it on Netflix at best"
83,"Personal drama (well done to E. M.) -> cheap horror -> lousy thriller -> utter nonsense.
Poor direction exploring the above in 30 min installments. The plot and characters are an insult to anyone who likes films."
84,"In addition to the protracted scenes, a rather average play of the actors, there are absolutely no logical things in the film.1. Why does Adrian chase for, to put it mildly, not the most beautiful girl. She couldn't even cook breakfast without burning the house!
2. For the entire film, we did not see a single manifestation of aggression from Adrian. What should convince us that invisibility is him?
3. Who are James and Sydney, and why do they help and fully believe Cecilia?
4. If we assume that Adrian was invisible in the hospital and killed a bunch of guards, then how did he not have the strength to hold his hand during the attack of Cecilia?As a result, the viewer appears callous, selfish and unbalanced murderer Cecilia and a loving (not clear why), caring Adrian."
85,"403. The Invisible Man. One of the most uninteresting versions of this tale I've seen. It should be called The Woman that fled the Invisible Man, well he's not invisible during the actual fleeing, which is right at the start of the film. Cecilla wakes up in the middle of the night and books it from the compound, um, home, that she and husband Adrian share, because he's a controlling abusive dick, this has all happened at this point already. So with the help of her lawyer sister she escapes her psychopath boyfriend by stashing her with a cop friend James and his teen daughter. So they are totally safe here, I mean Cecilla can't go outside due to crippling fear, and the teen girl,are perfectly safe and can take care of themselves if Adrian, the psychopathic, rich genius could never get at them while policeman James is at work. But then, Adrian kills himself, and leaves Cece 5 million bucks. Yay she's safe. Then for the next hour, she stares into corners and hears things, and thinks Adrian is there but invisible, because he's a rich genius and has a thing in his basement that looks like you can strap a person into it! But when this invisible Adrian starts killing people and guess who's going to get blamed? Elisabeth Moss did great with what she had to work with, which wasn't much. Lots of logic goes out the window with this one. And the trailer for it, is literally the whole movie! Watch a few a those stringed together and save yourself 2 hours! No spoilers in this review!

86,"Ok, I'm not saying this lightly because i go to the movies probably 7 to 10 times a week. This movie is the winner of 2020 I've been looking forward to. I've been following the talent behind the film director from ""Update"". I've also been following Oliver Jackson Cohen from the time he starred in ""Man in An Orange Shirt""(of which he did splendidly so if you haven't seen this film yet, put on your must watch) I discovered the versatility of this very outstanding actor. I can't tell you how scratched my dvd is by watching ""Man in the Orange shirt"" -yes its one of those film you will watch multiple time. This actor is a breath of fresh air. I';ve heard of Elizabeth Moss, but I'm glad I feel like I've truly discovered how talented this actress is. This movie kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time waiting to see what would happen next. I watch this film in a huge theatre totally packed! The audience jumped in unison many times over and were gasping in aw. It's a nail biting experience that does not let up. The beauty of this film is that it is a very fresh take on one of Universal's jewels. And the premise is very plausible in today's technology driven society. I'm watching this film again over the weekend. I know this film is destined to be a cash cow for Universal and a star maker for Oliver Jackson Cohen because he's done several independents, but I think they will remember him and he will become a household name after this film. Elizabeth Moss this film will take you places. To the director, I can't wait to see what he does next, because I'll be there to watch! twenty stars out of five for this film. Be warned, this film does not let up and will keep you gasping for air! I can't wait for ""The Invisible Man"" haunted house experience at Universal Studios Hollywood for Halloween. Oh, and that prank online done to the actors for the press junket is nothing short of genius. Best horror film of 2020!! I have spread the word about this film to anyone who will listen. you need to see this! its an experience!"
87,Oh my god this was boring. Can't believe there are people going around saying how scary and entertaining this movie is I fell asleep while watching it and even though I missed a big chunk of it I'm pretty sure if I cared to I could guess how the movie unfolds it is that predictable.If you want to watch a good invisible man movie then go see the original 1933 version.
88,"I read the reviews on here and decided to go and watch this absolute waste of 2hrs of my life.
The film was so slow, the acting was terrible, the plot was even worse.
I watched all the way to the end, partly because of the money and partly because I'd constantly be thinking 'did it get any better?'
Let me save you the time - IT DOESN'T!"
89,"I know it's silly to expect any kind of realism in a movie about an invisible man. But every movie at least has to make sense within its own universe. This movie has so many plot holes and logical inconsistencies which are horribly distracting.So the boyfriend pretends to have committed suicide, something which his brother (and executor of his will) proves to Elizabeth Moss with a photograph where the boyfriend is clearly recognizable. His face isn't mangled or anything, he has just cut his wrists. So who pronounced him dead and how? Did the brother show up to the police and the coroner with a photo of his brother and go ""Hey, here's my dead brother, let's get started with the execution of his will. What do you mean 'evidence'? Just trust me, bro!""Apparently the boyfriend was some optics wiz working with refractive projection and multiple cameras. Something which is explained in a six second insert of an article about his suicide. Nice backstory, bro. Actually, there is zero backstory in this movie. We have no idea what the relationship between Moss and her boyfriend was like, I guess we just have to take her word for it. There is zero character development, the boyfriend is just crazy apparently. I can't really call him a character at all, he's just a plot function. Why did the boyfriend build this suit at all? Was it only to stalk Moss in case she ever broke up with him? And why is his brother in on his scheme?And I thought for quite a while that her sister and the black cop were dating, but apparently not. What is his relationship to Moss that he allows her to move in with him and his teenage daughter? Just friends?The way the suit works is inconsistent. When the invisible man holds a gun the entire gun is visible, but the cell phone he used to take photos of Moss sleeping is nowhere to be seen. I guess he waddled out of the room like a duck after stuffing it someplace safe where the sun don't shine. And if the suit is built with cameras and projection, why isn't the ground or carpet under his feet completely dark? What about the insides of his thighs and his armpits where the cameras are just filming one another? Would it be visible or a video feedback loop? And how is the suit fooling more than one spectator at a time, viewing it from different angles? I'm getting ""Die Another Day"" flashbacks... If the movie was engaging, these are probably not questions I even would have though of. But here we are.But say we buy all this. The main problem is that as a horror movie it isn't particularly scary. There is no real sense of dread. I'm not talking about jump scares, those are startling (and cheap), not scary. And I'm certainly not talking about gore either. And it's far too long. This movie has no business being longer than 100 minutes.The Kevin Bacon version has two things working in its favor. First of all, there is a motivation for the invisibility and why he goes insane. Secondly, it's set in a limited and secluded location where the characters were trapped for the most part. In the 2020 version, Moss is roaming all over the place, all she needs is an Uber."
90,"Almost half an hour through the movie until something big happens, plot holes everywhere and very mediocre acting"
91,"I don't know or understand what all the fuss is about, but Elizabeth moss should definitely stop acting. I haven't even signed up on my account in a long while, i did this now to leave a review so it would save somebody's 2 hours of dear time.
I first saw this horrendous actor in TV series Top of the lake, i couldn't watch it just because of her.
Her acting couldn't be more horrible in this movie even if she did try.
And the movie itself, boy o boy, more like a movie for 8 year old girls. I'm not going to get started on all the plot holes.
My brain cells died watching her acting."
92,"This is not terror, just suspense. Everything is straight forward layed out since the freaking begining.One more Hollywood agenda flick.
Let me see...you have an iconic new feminism leading role actress playing the abused wife (go figure)...only 3 male characters...2 of them are white evils and the other is a black muscled useless law officer...as it is the law.Could have make it more interesring with a plot twist but i guess politically correctness was more importat. I wonder how many flops Hollywood can handle before realizing they need to do business before anything so entertainig should come once again first.On the Moss side, you can only portrait that character so many times... then what?"
93,"I am sure that there is no possibility that this film got good reviews and nobody paid for them.
Its complete rubbish, unrealistic, with major holes in the plot..."
94,"Had high hopes for this one. Seriously dissapointed. Took forever to get going then, when it did, it was just ridiculous."
95,"Very intense atmosphere with great cinematography. Excellent performances. I was expecting nothing after the trailers but then some reviewers talked it up for me and said it was nothing like the trailers. As my curiousity lead me to experience, it wasn't like shown. You have actually seen very little of the movie, and the context, build-ups etc. are incredible. The trailer really makes you think you've seen the whole thing and that it's kinda cheesy, but I'm so glad that was not the case at all as I'd been told.
One thing I really want to touch on is the writing... Having seen a horrible relationship up close where the guy would do the craziest stuff to keep her around while trying to control her, isolate her and make up insane lies about things and people from his own life, stalking, hiding around the house watching her and surprise her to see what she was doing etc., this movie just hit it right on. You cannot truly appreciate the writing and the meaning behind everything and how it touches upon it perfectly with not one moment misused, if you have not seen something like it happen up close. This story is a brilliant way of portraying this sort of dangerous, doomed relationship and trying to get out of it, and for that alone I'm glad it exists. Both as an obvious warning but also a powerful character played by Elisabeth Moss, a character I hope many will find aspiration in and will be remembered throughout the years. No feminazi agenda against men or making women superior for all the insecure people out there believing that. If anything, this movie encourages trust and fight together. Very good representation in all aspects and it doesn't rub it in your face, it all happens organically as it should.
As a movie and a piece of entertainment of course, it worked brilliantly. I hear talk about plot holes and I've got to be laughing. Either the people neglect talking about what plot holes there is (because *shock* there isn't really anything to be talking about as much of the relevant material is shown in the movie or indicated), or they refer to stuff that can be easily explained such as how an invisible man can come from place to place... Ehm, watch the movie.
A bunch of neckbeards are coming for The Invisible Man because things might get too personal for them or rather, too impersonal, but luckily it seems we are enough who can actually see the intent and are enjoying it. It truly does have Hitchcock elements and feels in terms of style, atmosphere and characters. A great homage and way to modernize a famous character, keeping a big present-day impact and showing not all monsters want the end of the world...but will go there if you try to escape them.BONUS: Perfect use of film score from start to finish."
96,"Probably written by a 8 yo kid with brain damage.Not a single redeeming quality, besides the dog, who was the most interesting part of this senseless, pointless, stupid plot full of holes the size of Texas.
Don't try to write a smart script if you aren't smart. If you have a simple brain, write a simple story. Or do something else.
Actually anything else: watch your toe nails grow longer, make a cake, walk your dog, throw oranges to random people, assault a bouncer. Anything is more entertaining than this dough."
97,Do not even think about watching the movie. Nothing in this movie makes sense. Everything about this movie is wrong. I am not gonna even get into details. It is just waste of time. Just don't watch it if you do not want to waste your time.
98,"In the first five minutes you knew exactly what was going to happen for the next hour and a half. I sat hoping for an interesting plot twist or someone to come and rescue this movie from invisibility. I can't believe the good ratings this movie is getting! I kept saying to my sister I just wish this movie would end already. Not scary, not fun, not interesting, just not everything."
99,"Very slow, very boring, lost interest in 1st fifteen minutes, slept in another, Please don't waste your time."
100,"I am an Elizabeth Moss fan and a horror fan, but my wife and I stopped watching at the 45 Min mark. What a shame. Nothing happens in the first 30 minutes of this 2 Hour movie, and then she starts ""interacting"" with the ""invisible man"", ridiculous. I won't mention any details, but was not thrilling, or gripping in the least, I kept thinking ""when is something going to happen? Poor reboot. The only commodity we have these days is time: use your wisely and choose another title for personal entertainment. FYI: I have something called the ""watch test"": if I find myself checking my watch during the movie, it is definitely not engrossing. Well, I checked it many times, and then we stopped watching after discussing if we wanted to invest any more time. Next."
101,"This version starts slow, continues to be slow, then ends with a great big boring. The main character actress actually make me wish she was invisible with her horrible and quite overacted performance.
So much more could have been done with this version but apparently hypocrite hollywood doesn't seem too concerned to put in the effort. I would pass on this snore fest."
102,Probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. It was very predicable it wasn't scary at all. Don't waste your money
103,"This film not only stands up to a problem (domestic abuse) that is present today for many women but takes a Brilliant bold twist on a classic tale.
The invisible man is a triumph in the horror genre with twist and turns in every corner and packed full of great scares !
If this film doesn't prove Elizabeth Moss needs an Oscar for her tremendous performance then I don't know what does !"
104,Full of thriller cliches just jumpy scenes lame script bad acting it deserves to be on cheap tv channels after 3 am
105,The plot just does'nt make any sense.The ending is also total crap.Everything is made with small connections.This was a total waste of time.
106,"If #metoo was a movie, this would be it.The strong womyn, abused by her evil, rich, white husband, deperately fights against all odds. Of course noone believes her, people think she's being crazy and hysteric, her only friend is an upstanding black cop, her only weapon in this unfair world her mental fortitude. But in the end - who'd have guessed, she has it all - against all odds, our slighty awkward heroine is on top of the world.I'd have loved to see the topic of invisibility explored properly, the technical and ethical aspects of it, the sheer endless possibilities. What we got instead was a poor and very political movies, that consisted mainly of plot holes, flat characters, post-modern stereotypes and predictable shortcomings that leave much to be desired in all areas.3/10"
107,"I have never been so angry with movie before. The story goes very slow that I fell asleep halfway. This should be titled ""The Invisible Man's Wife"" as it focused on the wife more than the invisible man himself."
108,"The female lead is homely.I wouldnt chat with her in the veggie aisle of a grocery store and this ""brilliant"" man spends all his time bothering her.He's nuts.The production values are fine,but the story is just dumb."
109,"Very blumhouse movie , meaning if you've seen a lot of there other random ones you'll know what this is like. Good ambience and tone set throughout. Very creepy vibe and good ending. Def worth the watch if you enjoy blumhouse movies and aren't an ahole that complains about movies with a female lead"
110,"Neither the poor writing nor the simple plot were able to hide the inability of the actors to... act. An eight-year-old might enjoy some of the effects and ideas, but would probably be unsettled by the gratuitous nature of the violence in many (completely unbelievable) scenes. I feel dumber for waiting until the last 10 minutes to walk out of this piece of garbage."
111,And save yourself the time & money it would take to watch this truly uninspired bore of a movie. Only Hollywood could take a great idea and turn it into a piece of politically correct dross.
112,Wasted time in this quarantine. Could have finished in 1 hour or less
113,"It seems that happy end movie era passed. Now is evil end is good end for movie.. Movie itself was ilogical in many situations. When main character do ilogical things, where any other person with average IQ would do it different way. Than I think, movie is good for dummy people.
Why she didnt took the phone from ceiling and gave to the police. Or she could run away with money and hide. In general she was insane and she killed man who loved her. Her murder was happy end, I guess, in this sick movie. And also, again black lover and white chick. You are boring, start putting Asians male characters.
Ridiculous start, when she run away from genious IT entreprenur and go to getho to be happy. Well... Stupid."
114,"This is simply a ""Battered Woman Syndrome"" version of the ""Invisible Man"" with caricature villains and highly implausible a.d predictable story-line.More plot-holes than the swiss cheesecake.Shame on you Leigh Whannell for selling-out. I'm a big fan of SAW series which he help created (and acted)."
115,Great concept...too drawn out and slow in the first hour. I wish it was the invisible woman so we wouldn't have to look at Moss's annoying face
116,"The Invisible Man is the first good horror movie and fifth horror movie of 2020 that I've seen. This film is seriously great.Leigh Wahnnell knows how to direct and craft a movie. He directs this film with a great amount of skill. Whilst the film isn't scary as such, it does make up for it by being made by a director who cares who about the genre. it's genuinely a terrifically made film. The lack of jump scares is a great choice as well.The film is slightly predictable apart from a couple of surprises. However it doesn't take away from the film. Although it would have been a much cooler movie, if the trailers weren't showing too muchRight from a very impressive start, the film hooks you, right into the very end. As far as flaws go, there are some plot holes or some things which don't make a lot of sense but that is full and far between. There are actually some amazing sequences in here especially a brilliant once in a psych ward against a bunch of armed officers.Elizabeth Moss is terrific. She carries this film and delivers the best performance of a 2020 released film so far this year. She is also a likeable character you root and care for. I think how the film recreates an iconic character and brings it into the modern day is equally as impressive.Overall 2020 has it's first great horror movie. However with The Hunt and Fantasy Island coming out in the next week or so. I'm not so sure. I can't wait to see what Wahnnell does next."
117,"Study multi billionaire genius ( and family) die while trying to play games with average looking ex wife.
Almost entertaining"
118,"This movie wants makes you want to take a knife and stick it in your throat. Getting to intermission for a viewer is no small feat. A freaking load of crap with no substantial plot, loopholes and unnecessary characters. Atul Khatri pls review this."
119,"From paint immediately washing off, to people not reacting how they were supposed to (I mean, who wouldn't freak out seeing a knife floating in the middle of of a busy restaurant. And that face punch to the girl form three feet away when you can CLEARLY see her huddled on the floor), this movie was a hot mess. I see what they were trying to go for but they missed the mark by like five miles."
120,"THE INVISIBLE MAN (2020) *** Elizabeth Moss, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Aldis Hodge, Storm Reid, Harriet Dyer, Michael Dorman. Filmmaker Leigh Whannell's unique re-imagining of the classic horror film updates it with Moss as a victimized woman whose attempt to leave her abusive relationship with wealthy optics genius Jackson-Cohen results in his suicide but eventually it's known to her that, instead, he has developed a method of becoming invisible to stalk her. Moments of true tension are cunningly employed thanks to the clever cinematography of Stefan Duscio and Benjamin Wallfisch's taut score but it is truly Moss' stellar turn as Cecilia Kass who manages to walk the tightrope of sanity while proving her sustainable urgency in bettering herself."
121,"This movie is not at all worth spending any money or popcorn on... If you've watched litterally everything on Netflix and need to have something playing in the background, this is it."
122,"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was painful trying to stay awake to watch it. It is at best laughable and should be marketed as poorly executed comedy. But the only thing funny is how horrible the entire thing is. I'm embarrassed for the everyone associated with this film. It is so slow, boring and completely illogical. And to think that they left it open ended for a sequel. Welcome to the razzies."
123,"After a failed attempt by Universal to create a shared Universe of Monsters that began with the Mummy in 2017. This second attempt comes to return the stories of iconic horror characters, and it is an unexpected success.This is the second film by director Leigh Whannell, which began with the underrated jewel of Upgrade, which in my opinion is very good, but not well known on this side of the world. Still, Universal seems to have seen potential, and thus man turns the franchise into his own.The commercial horror movie industry is often very generic, they are simple plots with cheap and not well crafted jump scares. So how to scare you with a movie about something that can't scream in your face? The answer is simple; A good script, a good direction, and the performance of Elizabeth Moss.The script creates situations, which although they may seem few, are very well built to achieve the necessary impact on the audience, and they grow as the story progresses, to reach a strong outcome, as well as one of the best Directed scenes of the movie. and that shows that the director can offer much more. This, with the credible performance of the main actress; his expressions, his way of moving and the appearance she brings. Give a tone of anxiety and anguish to the film, which make you feel that the threat is real and at the same time, to imagine that in that empty space there is someone watching you.The proposal of the story is different from all the previous adaptations of the character, and it is very interesting to see in this new installment. It becomes original for the entire duration of the movie, and shows us a very frequent theme in our society, about power-hungry controlling men, and adds an invisible one.Photography, also very well done, has movements that cover a whole space and that repeatedly put your imagination at stake, by making your mind work and make you think about where this enemy can be, in several scenes, it can show you where It is without the need to see it. and it gets creepy.Finally, the soundtrack is composed from Benjamin Wallfisch (IT) that increases the emotions of each scene with electronic and loud sounds, which combine very well with the tone of the film.In Conclusion it is an interesting new proposal by the director, as of Universal. By betting on a more independent approach and not as commercial as it was driving. That thanks to its script and execution, result in a good horror movie, with an original message, inspired by real situations.P.S. the new way that this character becomes invisible it's something to see 7o7."
124,Nothing special... Was entertaining enough..Hollow man with Kevin bacon in is better then this...
125,"According to this movie, white man is evil!!they are dependent qnd stupid and of course villain..men can be good as long as they are not white..and women are victim but at the same time smart and fealess..what a stupid movie"
126,"It seems like most of the film's budget went for positive reviews, because there is no chance this movie got more than one star our of 10. Don't waste your time like I did."
127,"Have been binging movies during the virus,this has definitely been the worst,filled with plot holes and inconsistencies,heck this is the first time I've ever felt the need to review negatively a movie. abstain from watching this crap"
128,I usually get scared in basic Bollywood horror movie but watching this movie was more over a comedy than thriller no story line nothing
129,We are a family of 5 and all LOVED this movie. Edge of your seat . Great acting. Perfect suspense movie. Seriously no complaints! All 5 of us loved it ! I am glad I didn't listen to the bad reviews.
130,"Watched ¬´ The Invisible Man ¬ª tonight and yes believe the hype ! It was really great. Surprisingly great. A lot of great camerawork that emphasizes the open space and vulnerability of characters. Griping tension, unexpected twist & turns. This film is gripping, intense, and expertly crafted. It's everything the trailer promised, and the performance from Elisabeth Moss is perfect. It is the best horror/thriller movie of the year (so far). With all the misfires from horror/thriller films we got in January this was a needed breathe of fresh air."
131,"Imagine being invisible and then having the ability to go through wall and closed doors but at the same time having the ability to selectively touch, grab, kick and punch physical objects. All this just to spite an ex who rejected you. Yawn.."
132,"The idea is absolutely amazing and original, but there was so many plot holes. i enjoyed it to be honest but not so much. the acting was good not amazing. so for me it's a 7.5"
133,"First, the one thing this movie has going for it: spooky cool camera shots of empty spaces where the invisible man might be. But that's all it has going for it, and I suspect the envisioning of those camera shots was the original idea around which a lame movie was built.So mostly it's one of those horror movies where the viewer is continually asking ""why doesn't she?""
Why doesn't she, when she realizes what's going on, buy a gun and a can of spray paint? Why doesn't she simply tell her sister someone hacked her email instead of insisting it was her invisible dead husband? And why does she put her family in danger anyway? Character was so bland and dumb you wonder what a genius, albeit a psychopath, saw in her.And speaking of the body count, the character's reactions to the death of a loved one are practically nonexistent. Like the writers couldn't bother with writing a human reaction. So her brother in law's wife is murdered and nothing much in his life seems changed. He's even at work interrogating the supposed murderer. The writers are just too caught up in their cool scenes with special effects of fighting the invisible man. And BTW, that mental hospital scene were the guards realize there is a invisible something they are fighting seemed a little copy cat if the mental hospital scene in Terminator II.So no characters, no smarts. Compare to a horror movie like ""A Quiet Place"", in which the characters are smart, resourceful, and have actual complex human emotions.And I'm getting tired of watching Elizabeth Miss get abused."
134,"My only complaint about this movie is that the whole thing could've been avoided if she just pulled out her phone and recorded anything at all. Otherwise, good acting, good twists, spooky atmosphere, some nice jump scares."
135,"Besides plot holes such as why Sydney could possibly think Cecilia hit her when Cecilia was on the floor right in front of her, the reason I wouldn't give this film a higher score is because they revealed the antagonist too soon.There is no suspense whether The Invisible Man exists. His first ""prank"" with the bacon and egg was fine, but removing the knife in front of us audience really hurts the suspense. Now we all know The Invisible Man is real, and not some figment of imagination from PTSD. Thereafter whenever Cecilia stares at a corner, we know for certain The Invisible Man is there. Zero suspense.The writers also opened the door to there being multiple invisible men, which would have made an overused but still interesting plot twist. But nope, didn't happen.By the way, if The Invisible Man is always stalking, then when does he sleep, and where could he safely sleep while staying close to his prey? Just curious."
136,"Hats off to Elisabeth Moss for attempting to bring the kind of intensity and fear that would have been required for any semblance of horror or suspense. There is very little to excite the mind throughout a pretty trudgingly slow plot, and the villainous portrayal of a man in an invisible suit would work much better with a more realistic representation of the person in the suit.Does it provide super-human powers to the wearer? At times his strength and agility while invisible seem outrageously overdone. Does this suit somehow afford him incredible speed to catch up to his wife who was in a car (and seemingly let him know just where she was going)? But most importantly, what is his endgame?? There doesn't seem to be much motivation for Adrian/Tom in the plot other than to simply torture Cecilia, which diminishes the story until the ""surprising"" reveal of her pregnancy. But even then, there doesn't seem to be a real goal to attain for them.Do yourself a favor, give this one a hard pass."
137,Predictably manipulative. More dumb decisions by victims to set up more manipulation. Was expecting more than this. Glad I didn't pay to see this.
138,"This movie has a second grade cast. There is not a single ""scary/horror"" scene nor any suspense. Too bad Redbox doesn't give refunds. Universal should be embarrassed to have their name on this so called film."
139,"TIM begins well with plenty of tension. As the film unfurls,the audience considers that Cecilia really is being stalked by her invisible partner or is she so stressed out she's gradually going cuckoo? The film plays on that mystery and while that mystery remains, it ticks over quite nicely. Unfortunately,and inevitably, the film has to play its hand and comes clean as to what is actually going on. And when it does, the film effectively falls apart. Had the film gone down the 'psychological' route then it would have ended up a more entertaining viewing experience than it did. Instead it went down the 'sci-fi / thriller' route, relying on clever special fx to distract from the general silliness of the plot. Over all the film is good fun in the same way as 1950's b-movies were good fun but as a potentially brilliant piece of psychological drama (as the film starts off as being),unfortunately it falls flat on its face half way through."
140,It was an okay movie that turned into a predictable movie. If the ending was different i'd give it 4 stars
141,"Several reviewers here noted the genuis of the original 1933 film, and they're right to, with its wonderfully rich and intruiging story. This 2020 'adaptation' is a slap in the face to its legacy. However, even if I were to judge it without comparison to the original, it is still a terrible movie. Yes, Elizabeth Moss is a solid actor, but there was nothing here for her or any supporting actors to work with.The main issue isn't that the story is FULL of plot holes, but there are so many that I literally slapped my own forehead twice. The cinematography is bland and unimaginative, as is the film score. Character development is entirely absent. At least if we'd gotten to know these characters, we could've routed for them. Overall, it's just bland; a two-dimensional, all too predictable, meh-festival. I really hated this, and I didn't want to.Watch the 1933 original instead -- now THAT was a film!"
142,"I was shocked how bad this movie was. I expected a good movie. Good reviews. Sadly, I watched it and discovered that quality was absent. Stupid characters. Unbelievable that the bad guy would be that invested in the protagonist (read what you wish). No. Just, no."
143,"Naive and ridiculous propaganda against husbands, written by pseudo-feminist lunatics."
144,"I do not understand how anyone could enjoy this movie. Yes, it had potential, but I've never seen a character... actually it seems as though every horror movie these days has this type of character as the lead... but a character that literally did everything a you shouldn't do. Don't waste your time watching something that will piss off. There is nothing reputable for this movie at all. Just read the synopsis for a few minutes. Do not watch the movie."
145,"It's a movie which should be required viewing by film students. It teaches the importance of proper lighting, skilled acting, and having a proven leading actor."
146,"Over and over the characters made implausible choices, or the details had serious errors which detracted too much from being able to watch the movie and enjoy it.For instance, when Cecilia drops a can of paint on the invisible man: moments later Griffin has cleaned his whole suit in the kitchen sink and is invisible again. Apparently the writers have never had to clean wet paint off of anything because this was way too quick, especially that the suit is full of crevaces... it would have been better for Griffin to leave for the night and come back later...Cecilia's sister is overwhelmingly invested in helping Cecilia, but when she receives the email, she's completely turned on Cecilia. It's unbelievable that the sister would turn that quickly. Instead of that forceful of a turn and removing herself from Cecilia's life, the sister should have just said she needed space. This would have been a more believable response, still alienating Cecilia without making the reaction unbelievable.Cecilia escapes the mental ward of the detention center through an unlocked stairwell door... Again implausible. She should have grabbed keys and. Leaving out a 5 second spot ruined the scene. Then when she's running around the parking lot there's only two guards after her despite the multiple guards she passed exiting the movie. These guards too are so far behind her that she can walk casually between cars. These guards would have been hot on her tail. Then, the second guard is no where in sight when Griffin is firing at the first guard. They seem to have disappeared just like the invisible man himself.Wounds sustained by the invisible man don't seem to follow from scene to scene. He was stabbed by Cecilia, but those wounds never seem to follow into next scenes. Then in the last scene of the movie where she's sitting at the table, it would have been easy for her to touch him where she stabbed him, just to verify one of his many wounds he should have still been healing from.After Griffin's brother Tom is killed, and it's been revealed that Adrian Griffin is still alive, the police simply believe that Tom did it all himself... Despite it being apparent that Adrian is still alive. Everyone seems to forget that Adrian faked his own death. This would have been impossible for Tom to pull off on his own. Meanwhile the police don't seem at all interested in the fact that Adrian Griffin is still alive. Again, totally implausible choices on behalf of the characters made the movie unenjoyable.Things like this happened over and over again in the movie."
147,Don't waste your time. It's pure trash. The plot is an offense to the audience. Absolutely awful.
148,"This is the most disturbing version of the invisible man I have ever seen.A wholly unique story, at first it has nothing to do with science fiction. It appears to be a simple domestic issue. Until some creepy things start happening.Creepy things that are made to appear as if you are the person responsible...The mechanism that renders a person invisible here, is totally unlike anything used in any film relating to the invisible man.In the past it has always been some kind of potion or electrochemical process.Actually this method is somewhat like something James Bond would use, something from M, when John Cleese was still playing that character. That's all I will say about it.There's one thing that kind of bothered me about the character of Cecilia though, she did very good detective work, but then when she has the dripping red meat in her hands, she kind of drops it. There was one point in this film when she discovers something that could have turned everything around right at that moment, but instead she just walks away and gives her tormentor more opportunity. And because of that shortsightedness, she suffers a huge loss.But without that, the ending of the film would not really be as good as it is, and it just gave the film much more of the human error element. I imagine the ending of this film could have taken on a totally different tone had she become more proactive, because generally when you find out a secret, the best thing to do is to make it work for you.An excellent revisioning of the film that Claude Rains originally starred in."
149,"I absolutely loved The Invisible Man! Elizabeth Moss is an incredible actress she deserves so much credit! I wasn't expecting a lot of what occurs and it very much reminded me of Hollow Man except better cinematography and story. I love Leigh Whannel's style, I've been able to connect with him on Twitter a little that really was cool. Also the music was so intense, I loved it all!Edit: I saw again and loved it so much!"
150,"Unpredictable. Keeps you on edge! I honestly cannot Believe how good this movie is! After months of sucky movies this year, finally a movie worth my money! MUST SEE MOVIE OF THE YEAR!"
151,"Without giving away any spoilers,
Just because someone can't see you, why does this mean you have superhuman strength and speed?
Also the main characters actions are just so ridiculous it spoils the film, if you really think an invisible psycho is stalking you and trying to kill your family and friends, why would you spend the entire move with your family and friends, and not just leave them alone?"
152,"Described by the angle of the actress , it is a low-cost and high-effect movie, an effective and complete story, a few scenes, simple CG stunts, Invisible man in military technology.
Investors must be very happy to become a well-known film.
It's nice to have a tense atmosphere and followability."
153,"Every story has a start a middle and an end so this is how it goes,The beginning of this movie is very poor as it plays out like a B MOVIE & we don't know any of the actors something that will ultimately be the movies downfall,there is no introduction as to what is about to unfold & this leaves you wondering whats going on since the title has you expecting,The middle of the movie at least a good half hour in picks up the pace and we get more parts of the PUZZLE but it still seems a little FRANTIC & OVER THE TOP with a few cheap effects to introduce the title character however the plot introduces some twists & it manages to keep you engaged & intrigued,Finally the ending is were we shift gear into full throttle & the mystery unravels around several scenarios with some interesting ideas & outcomes with a satisfactory FINALE.So everything considered this movie could have been great but instead it has failed in several places especially the cast & some of the effects but as a B MOVIE it could be considered decent enough.....WORTH A WATCH"
154,"So predictable events like another recent movies men are bad and women are victims and end of movie like other horror movies THE WOMAN SURVIVES.
form the beginning to the end you can predict what is going on."
155,"This film really is a missed opportunity. An intense thinker-thriller could have been created with better writing and direction, where the audience goes back and forth between thinking there is an invisible man and thinking our protagonist is crazy. Instead, The Invisible Man boasts its antagonist and many of his antics in the trailer, giving far too much away. The tension is certainly there but it feels cheap at times. What bumps this from a 6 to a 7 for me is one absolutely jaw-dropping scene 2/3 through the film."
156,Terrible movie. Boring. Half a dozen huge plot holes. Average acting at best. A solid two hours and ten minutes of nothing. Don't waste your money on this garbage.
157,"First of all, I liked that Elizabeth Moss was chosen as the main character, especially since there are many similarities between her character in the movie and her character in ""The Handmaid's Tale"".
I watched the premiere, without seeing any reviews about it before, and enjoyed every second of it.
The movie from the very first scene, fascinates you in a way that you can't stop watching and gets you excited about every little thing that's gonna happen.
Great plot, great cast. The music was a bit too loud. I got so much into the movie, that once the movie ended my body was still shaking."
158,This movie has ample mystery and thrill involved. Great acting with a very involving story.
159,"Just when you think the movie has no more surprise in store, it takes a new turn!
Absolutely amazing....Highly reccomended!"
160,"""The Invisible Man"" (2020) is an incredible sci-fi horror thrilling reboot since the Mummy (2017), and one of the horror movies that flopped this year. The Invisible Man is remarkable, scary, thrilling, and terrifying for me and all the audience who loves horror movie icons for the century. But this year in 2020, every horror movie has flopped this year like: ""The Grudge"" (2020), ""The Turning"", and ""Gretel & Handel"". But not this one. The Invisible Man is where he will be looking after your shoulder, and never lets go. Now this is a new horror movie to enjoy what you can't see, can scare the hell out of you."
161,"Amazing movie, I did not expect to like it more. Loved the acting of Elizabeth Moss, the story can be almost perfect, It is a one hell of a ride for a horror-thriller movie."
162,I think it was a great movie...some reviewers are too critical and want a movie to be literal...whoever commented that hollow man was better definitely isn't a good critic!It had me in the edge from the beginning!
163,"Just came out of a showing and absolutely loved everything about this movie and how the story evolved. The acting is superb and subtle camera work keeps you in suspense and staring into the dark corners wondering if there is something to be seen.The movie does a fantastic job of not insulting the intelligence of the audience and instead puts you directly into the shoes of the lead actress. The pacing is greatly appreciated as from the title alone we understand what is going and it moves fast enough that the two hour run time feels much faster but not rushed in anyway as once the story begins to gain speed it continues to a well deserved and satisfying ending.The cast is spectacular and delivers a top notch performance, if you are fan of suspense this is exactly the type of movie for you."
164,"Where do I start?
Horrible acting from horrible characters.The"" invisible man"" was the best actor.
unevenly paced and tried to be cool...it wasn't.
He's not even invisible...he wears a suit...oh Lord help us.
The lead was so annoying ...terrible actress.
Even the dog was one dimensional.
I'm all for re-makes with a female lead but you have to make it bearable.
Ending was so stupid we actually laughed in the theatre.
C.G.I was like an amateur project.
Nothing....NOTHING like the original...and should not be uttered alongside.
All in all a pathetic gorefest and 2 hours of my time lost."
165,First and foremost I had no idea this was a Horror movie of sorts. The opening scene(s) is fantastic and the suspense is pretty intense but once I realized what was going on in this story (title explanatory I guess) I was a bit turned off and couldn't believe I was going to watch another 1.5 hours of this storyline.Things ended up taking a drastic turn about halfway through and I'm all here for it. A bunch of crazy twists late. Some questionable suspense scenes but kept me on the edge. Really like the end concept not the original.Final scene is badass.
166,"Best thrills are the cliche of making sound go from 0 to 120%. Acting alright but unbelievably stupid, each persons script it based on the intelligence of a toddler. The film attempts to justify itself with some of what it and probably the teenagers watching it think is clever, but ultimately tho whole thing was a waste of time and resources. Sucks that people making this garbage make so much more than hard working people. Dont waste your money"
167,"My Review- The Invisible Man.
My Rating 8/10. No Spoilers AlertI've never begun a review with an audience WARNING! but if you or your friends have experienced extreme Domestic Violence and are planning to see this very chilling and very suspenseful film it could disturb and upset you.Another ambassador of our great Australian local movie talented Director ,Writer and Producer Leigh Whannell from Melbourne who also directed Aquaman, Saw,and Insidious has made a very suspenseful, dramatic and violent interpretation of the 1897 H.G. Wells literary classic The Invisible Man.In this version though it's the very visible Elizabeth Moss as Cecilia Kass who is trying to escape an emotionally and physically violent relationship from her partner an Indie tech genius who appears to control every aspect of her life who makes this movie so good and suspenseful.
Elizabeth Moss is rarely off screen in The Invisible Man and her performances just get better and better. It's not easy in a movie of over 2 hours to command the screen and hold the audience enthralled as to what your character is going to present us with next.
Since her appearances in West Wing 1999 as Zoey Bartlett the Presidents daughter and then of course in ""Madmen "" (2007-2015) as Peggy Olsen in 92 episodes followed by her superb performance of June Osborne in the chilling 3 seasons of The Handmaid's Tale Elizabeth Moss is now one of the most Box Office bankable and sought after film and television actresses in the world.
I think the reason for her success is partly because Elizabeth Moss is attractive but just in an ordinary way her face and expressions are a blank canvass and she colours them in with her superb grasp of the characters she plays.
I mean it as a compliment that she is no Charlize Theron or Nicole Kidman,or Margo Robbie or even Saoirse Ronan in a classical beautiful way and that you could pass her in the street dressed as an office worker and perhaps not look twice but she has that rare talent and gift of reality in acting.The pace of this film right from the beginning never gets dull and of course there's other very good performances to mention Harriet Dyer as Cecilia's sister ,Aldis Hodge as the Cop James Lanier who hides Cecelia and Storm Reid as his daughter are a great dramatic trio in The Invisible Man.I came away very entertained wondering how some of the plot twists ,especially the thrilling conclusion were probable but if you can stretch reality to believe in an invisible man you can allow for some improbability.
I had my own theory of the conclusion but I was wrong mine would have possibly been more believable but perhaps not as bizarre and this film needed a bizarre ending.Special mention to composer of The Invisible Man Benjamin Wallfisch the English composer, conductor, and pianistSince the mid-2000s, he has composed and contributed to music for over 60 feature films .His compositions include original scores for A Cure For Wellness, Hidden Figures, Lights Out, Desert Dancer, It, Blade Runner 2049, and Shazam!. In 2017, he was jointly nominated with Pharrell Williams and Hans Zimmer for Best Original Score at the 74th Golden Globe Awards for his work on Hidden Figures, and a BAFTA Award and Grammy Award for Blade Runner 2049
He also composed scores for Dunkirk and Stephen King's ""IT "" 2017 Movie and the suspenseful music he has composed for the opening scenes and titles to The Invisible Man with huge waves crashing on the rocks set us up for the thrills and chills ahead of us."
168,"Elisabeth Moss' amazing acting and the story's development make the viewer doubt the cause of the main character's mental breakdown during the first half of the movie. This, as well as the great directing, keeps us on edge throughout the film. Long takes and shots with noone in them add to the stress of the character's situation.There were, however, several jump scares and moments with loud music that didn't need to be there to make the film scary, as the plot was already sufficiently tense. Furthermore, I found that the ending of the film was out of character for Cecilia.All in all, I would recommend this film as it delivers a great thriller thanks to the acting and the story."
169,"It is an average budget film.
It is fun in the horror sense to watch with a woman.
Otherwise, just typical"
170,"This movie is two hours in length. There is no build up to the story or any back story, it commences with it's suspense from the outset of the movie.After 1 hour, in the cinema, I looked at my watch, and again, and then again... The story at this point draaaaaaaaagggeed. I literally wanted it to finish, I would of been happy if the credits came up after an hour.. but no! Another hour to go...The CGI was really poor, I've seen better CGI in a 70s movie than this. You could tell where the green screen was, and it just made it cheap and nasty. The scene in the hospital where the Invisible Man holds the gun... Come on.. I mean, you'd think in 2020 the CGI would be good. It would have looked better if you saw the strings holding up the gun...The 'suspence music' was cringe worthy, it spoiled the scenes, it was either too over dramatic and loud or too loooong and unnecessary. It really did spoil the scenes.The storyline had plot holes galore, which I won't spoil for the reader..The acting was good, and I've gave it an extra star for that, but overall, the movie was just boring and dull and cringy and too long."
171,"Is it ""Elisabeth Moss's"" face reactions ? Is it the beautifully terrifying way of moving the camera or keeping it still ? or may be the slow increasing thrill that builds up throughout the movie ?All of the above are elements which made the movie quite enjoyable as a thrill movie and a horror one in the second place.From the trailer you will have one question, Is she sane or not ? and the director gave us the answer slowly in the last third of the movie, however this interpretation can be predicted by a lot.""Elisabeth Moss"" nailed it here, she showed that she can do more than the famous ""disgusting"" face in ""The Handmaid's Tale"", I am looking forward to see her in more engaging roles. All supporting actors really did their best.The cinematography is creative here, with a lot of moments that make you wonder anxiously a lot about the upcoming event.The Jump scares are few here but they really effective and deep.The finale is a little bit predicted and fair for all the sides which may not be liked a lot, and it basically diminish all the possibilities for a sequel.Finally, It's a worth to watch thrill/horror movie which has the taste of 90's but much more enjoyable."
172,"I cannot believe the 7+ rating this film has. Totally waste of two hours of my life. First of all cast is completely unrealistic. No one believes that a successful scientist, that has invented invisibility will take so much effort and time with the main character of the film... honestly I believe this is a ""me too"" take on the invisible man story, taking advantage of the handsmaid's tail that really doesnt make any sense... Awful. Make yourself a favor and avoid."
173,"I saw the reviews and though hey, this sure can't be that bad with such good ratings. Well let me tell you I don't have the words to describe how horrendous the plot is. Her acting isn't that bad, but you literally can't even take her seriously with all the ridiculous events happening in addition to the horrible writing and plot holes. I'm sincerely sorry for the people who had to act in this (hope they at least got paid enough)"
174,"She wasn't captivating here. You don't feel the need to root for her. It was like, ok I don't get why this guy is obsessed with her. The story is entertaining but executed poorly. Could've been done better by another director and lead actress. Other commenter was right, Hollow Man was way better."
175,"Don't watch it. Best advice I can give you. Explaining anything about this movie will waste more of my time and yours, WALK AWAY!!!"
176,"Entire audience was waiting for the film to end...
Nice sound though."
177,"I typically don't see horror or suspenseful movie but made an exception given the positive buzz and reviews. (My daughters and wife playfully tease me because of my unease with this movie genre.) Terror can be displayed in many forms. The subtle terror of much of The Invisible Man, where the antagonist is lurking but hidden, or may not be there at all, is executed brilliantly. Elizabeth Moss does a stellar job carrying the movie. She has learned to communicate effectively without words. Her ability to convey myriad emotion through facial expression, learned well from her time on the cast of The Handmaid's Tale, effectively translates to the big screen in this novel adaption of this classic story.Leigh Whannell does well building tension throughout the movie. The successful integration of sound and music adds to the palpable terror felt by the movie goers and enhances Elizabeth Moss's portrayal of a shattered person.There are a few big, plot gaps that made the movie more unrealistic than it needed to be. I can support the concept that made Oliver Jackson-Cohen invisible. I found myself less willing to embrace a few items that disturbed me immediately in the moments I saw them. These are the two that bothered me the most -
the guard staffing level @ the hospital during the late eveningthat the Invisible Man would exhibit unreasonable strength during some of the climactic moments of the movieAn aside, but potentially worth mentioning as well - there are scenes depicted in the trailer that aren't in the movie -
the Invisible Man's hand-print on the shower doorthe action that occurs in the investigating room when Elizabeth Moss is in police custodyThere are scenes from the trailer that would have been better if first observed when watching the full production -
the Invisible Man's visible breath when he's standing next to the protagonist on a cold eveningI'm supportive of scenes that end up on the cutting room floor being used to boost interest and ""word-of-mouth'. I'm less supportive of scenes depicted in a trailer that are better served and best viewed in the movie itself. From my perspective, it's a missed opportunity to make the movie experience ""pop"" in the moment.I was able to set aside my misgivings during these moments because my objective when viewing most movies is simply to be entertained. And The Invisible Man was able to entertain, even if that entertainment was experienced mostly through elevated pulse and blood pressure. Bring someone you care about and enjoy the energy together because overall, the big screen serves this telling reasonably well."
178,"At the time of writing this short review, the IMDB rating is at 7.5.
Any movie with this rating must be pretty good right? Even though people's movie preferences differ, it must at least be something worthwhile watching one would think and I've always let myself be guided by the IMDB rating to determine if a movie is a time waster or not and it has seldom failed me.Well in this case the IMDB rating is just completely off.The movie is about a battered wife trying to flee from her cruel but brilliant husband. All her previous attempts were failures as he always outsmarted her. When she eventually manages to get away, she is informed by his brother that he is dead and she inherited a handsome amount of money. She starts rebuilding her life glad to be rid of him, although signs start to appear that he may still be around.The Invisible Man is full of cliches. There is nothing here that you have not seen before. The odd twist in the tale is advertised so clearly at the start of the movie that by the time it is revealed, most people would have figured it out long ago.Don't waste your time with this one. Rather watch the Kevin Bacon version again. At least it had a better developed storyline and included both Rhona Mitra and Elizabeth Shue in their prime.I give this 4 points simply for the dog's acting (Zeus)."
179,"The first third of this movie is more than passable. In fact, you might say it starts with a reasonable good premise, albeit with some minor issues from time to time. The story is simple although there really aren't many details provided. A woman escapes her tyrannical ex-husband's gorgeous, immense and security laden fortress to be out of his life. On the way out, she sees an odd room that stays in memory. She decides to stay with friends who give her sanctuary and help her recover from her fear of being watched by her ex, who made his fortune being a genius in optics. But soon after she begins to gain her strength back, she believes that she is seeings signs that someone invisible may be following her which she believes is her ex. This begins subtly at first and it is executed very well, keeping the tension on the screen with camerawork that allows you to be drawn in.And then begins the twists and the story and the script unravels quickly. Credibility plunges, especially when characters don't act naturally and sometimes so dumb that they even make dumb people look smart. The first reveal takes place in a lawyer's office and the reveal is so poorly executed that I wondered out loud WTF. This poorly executed plot placement is like seeing a scene where our hero is walking through an airport to the plane with her pet orangutan, without security stopping her. Just assume this stuff happens, no questions asked. The film continues to get dumber each successive scene to the point where several people in the audience were laughing out loud.Some of the more suspense filled scenes and confrontations were so fake and contrived. Who acts the way they did? Why aren't there other people you'd expect to be around, except on a Hollywood set? We were practically hearing the director yell ""OK, now you two security guards run forward, look like you're confused and terrified, do something really stupid so you can freeze to wait for someone else to do something."" It's that bad. The CGI for reveals is also quite poor.Now I wish I could say that the film was resolved well. But it's so poorly and stupidly done that I honestly can't even tell you what really happened because none of it actually adds up. The script surely doesn't support it. The film has incredible conceit in thinking, like a bunch of 7 year olds, that it's really clever. But it isn't. The 4 is for good production, some good build up in the first third of the film, OK performances from the actors with this shlock script and nothing else whatsoever after the scene with the lawyer.Many of the reviews here are so obviously fake, as are the votes. The hollow, complete lack of depth to the characters makes you begin to not care whatsoever about any of them and you just hope the end is near for this ridiculous film. And then when you reach it, you'll be scratching your head. And then forget it all very easily."
180,"Don't watch this. I mean it, Don't watch this. This isn't some sort of reverse psychology, this is just a BAD MOVIE. It's bad, really, REALLY bad.Don't get me wrong, Elizabeth Moss is an awesome actor/actress, especially in The Handmaids Tale and I've always loved Aldis Hodge since Leverage, but this is just BAD.Seriously, barely anything in the plot required an actual ""Invisible Man"".They could have just called it ""Abusive-Boyfriend-Survival-Movie""I kinda wish I could get the 124 minutes of my life back, don't waste 124 minutes of yours, or do, it's not like my opinion matters."
181,I can't believe this trash has got decent reviews. I wanted to walk out of the theater so many times and demand my $10 back. Movies like this are the reason no one attends theaters any more. Stay at home and watch when it comes out on cable TV next year.
182,"Seriously, why is everyone here being so harsh?
The movie overall is really great, the story is captivating, the special effects are amazing and the acting of Elizabeth Moss is outstanding! Truly one of the best movies I've seen recently!"
183,This movie will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Elizabeth Moss is on top form here. What an actress!
184,"Saw this movie due to its somewhat high rating, both on users' rating and on metascore. Well, 2 hours of my life lost. Incredibly dumb, unconvincing acting, and even dumber directing and script. I mean, what kind of ""thriller"" gives away its most central point right at the beginning of the movie? They mustn't think high of the intelligence of their target audience, to put it mildly."
185,"I was kinda excited about this movie. It's a great idea, and that's all this movie was.Building up suspense by doing what every other ""thriller"" does already made me dislike it by the 60 minute mark. The second part of the movie started out right, but then made me actually hate it.Dumbing down the plot by making the main character paralyzed with fear in every other scene, the main villain having superhuman strength and agility, guards in an asylum using deadly firearms, and of course a restaurant not having a single camera to record how someone got murdered among other things, made me absolutely anxious. It was movie night for my wife and I, so I stayed until the end. Otherwise, I'd have shut it off after 30 or 40 minutes in.And then the ""thriller"" part of the movie. Seriously, are we still supposed to be scared by sudden loud noises?The cast did a good job, no issues there.In short: The general idea was fantastic, the acting was great, the script was dumb."
186,"For the first 30 mins I was almost falling asleep, after I felt asleep. No idea why people loved this movie. Just boring ..."
187,"If I'm not mistaken, every version of the invisible man has always had that plot of the man using his miracle of science to do something creepy to a woman. The only difference in this version is that it takes up the whole movie cause it's done from the women's perspective instead of the man.
Elisabeth Moss is making an interesting career telling the struggles of women in the most extreme matter. Sure, Mad Men was kinda tamed but the Handmaid's tale isn't and neither is this.
The invisible man is genuinely one of the most scariest movies I've ever seen and that's because it took the worse situation a women could possibly be in and used advance technology to make it worse. Genius
I will admit that there were elements of the movie I did not fully understand. I can't tell if it's because the filmmakers were being too subtle on the approach or is it just because I'm a man (most likely the latter) but either way it was all great. A great thriller and a great horror movie."
188,Storyline very weak and Predictable. Acting was very average. I didn't turn it off but lost interest. Watchable.
189,"Watched this movie without reading any review, and was captured by the first minute until the final scene. Great acting by miss Moss as usual. One of the best movies ive seen this year."
190,Do not watch this movie. It is a complete waste of time. So dumb it makes me want to cry. Plot holes all over the place.That movies like these are produced disgusts me.
191,"Others have said similar, the logic is nowhere to be seen.
In general, I hate those horror/thriller movies that rely exclusively on immense silence followed by a loud bang to jump scare you. It's super lazy and tiresome.There are some good visuals, the way the camera moves and shows empty rooms is eery, it adds suspense and a sense of the unknown. A threat coming from right in front of you, and you can't see it. But...ultimately, it just relies on loud bang jump scares to make it tense.The suit itself is cool, but never explained at all. How is it powered? Can infra red cameras see it? How does he mask the sound of his breathing or his foot steps? How is he suddenly super strong and capable of picking a person up with one hand? Taking multiple stab wounds to the chest and neck area without seeming to be affected at all? The suit makes a lot of noise when you see it, cameras everywhere constantly moving, why can that suddenly be silent when it's on? How come something like this can go unnoticed by the government or military? Is he Tony Stark?! How does he always get around such distances? Why did no one sort his house out? Someone covered his stuff in sheets but then apparently gave up on sorting it? Who was looking after the dog? How come a tin of white paint can get washed off in seconds and leave absolutely no trace? Why would he get himself locked up in her mental hospital room every night? How is it that no one ever bumped into him? How come a total drenching from rain does nothing to damage an entirely camera pased suit? Why wouldn't she carry a can of spray paint and a video camera around everywhere she went? Why did that girl ever think she'd hit her when she was literally looking directly at her, from a good 6 feet away, at the moment she got hit? Were there no security cameras in the restaurant when she was framed for murder? When and how did he put his phone and a random knife in her attic? And why do that at all? Was he living up there? How would that work? He'd make so much noise just moving an inch. When he stepped on her sheet and was walking towards her, why didn't she throw herself onto him while shouting for the guy to come in? How could she ever go back to sleep knowing he was there? Why wouldn't he change the pin codes to everything after she left? Why was he so obsessed with her? If he knew she was pregnant, and that's why he still wanted her in his life, why terrorise her and put her in real physical danger? What the hell was the point in the entire plot, what was his end game?! She killed him because he said one word? Her sisters boyfriend (a cop) was immediately ok with knowing she killed him? Her constant pathetic, weak, terrified persona instantly gets transformed into a cunning, ruthless, brave, deceiving superwoman out of nowhere?....SO MANY FLAWS IN LOGIC.The movie does a good job at building suspense. The tension of not being able to see a person in the room is done quite well and it is very spooky and makes you feel uneasy. That's literally it for the good stuff."
192,"The invisible man left me wondering, could Adrian actually be innocent? Also,how does that suit make one invisible? Unlike the invisibility cloak from Harry potter, this suit kinda sorta looks like it can actually be made in real life"
193,"Ridiculous plot. Very silly film completely devoid of logic. Zero character development and plot holes the size of the house of the would be inventor. More than invisible, this film is unwatchable. Lacking in all departments and, quite frankly, tedious."
194,"I'll be generous and give it an 8, I liked it a lot but there were some plot holes that I couldn't ignore, like is he invisible or is he ethereal? Which means you can pass right thru him. At times they couldn't help bumping into him and other times when they seemed to pass right thru him, but this is based on a movie from 1933 where they didn't focus so much on those things. And the ending went from total shock and not knowing who did these things to wait a minute, was so and so really the bad person here or not? And I'm not sure they ever really answered that, but if I remember correctly the original movie did have some spinoffs, like the invisible woman, so we'll see lol. But definitely worth a see if u like suspense movies!"
195,"Weirdly stupid decisions all the time.1. Listen to your sister if she said she didn't send the email.2. Too many horror/suspense film cliches3. Weird that he had to pull the blanket and do disco lighting to the bedroom light. Imagine being a sociopath and doing those kid tricks.4. Sydney was hit in the face from kilometres apart and accused Cecellia for it. I thought she was quite ""mature of her age""5. The film talked about thousands of cameras on a small suit but the restaurant, the psychiatric ward or any other public places doesnt have a single camera that shows a knife or a gun is flying around killing people.6. How the Invisible man travel such long distances so quickly? Flash powers, eh?7. How is Adrian not dead if his body was found? No autopsy or post-mortem?8. Before Adrian could life Cee up like a toy (maybe the suit gave super strength as well) and later Cee took Adrian's hand and waited and waited and waited and then slit his throat. Super Powers????So in short, skip this movie if you love movies....!!!!Seriously, skip it...!!!"
196,"All of the bad reviews are based on missing small details like camera usage, how'd he travel, etc. Perhaps these could have been touched better, but it's almost beside the point. His brother was evidently in on it and there was more than 1 suit, presumably 2, but maybe more. Also, when the mask was taken off, normal skin is shown, so that covers all of the other possible travel and normality in public concerns.
The movie is also held under a short timeline, roughly a few weeks. Sourcing footage can take who knows how long in normal crime investigations.
Shut up and enjoy the movie. It's a movie, not a documentary."
197,"Sprawling shots build tension and make the environment a character in every scene because of the unknown. The Shining did this incredibly well. Kubrick was very good as using specific cutaways, zoom ins and outs; playing games with the audiences expectations of when and how they could be frightened. The Invisible Man is a title you hear and go ""yeah, okay, another remake?"" But it isn't just that.Elisabeth Moss I have followed since her name was Zoey Bartlet on the West Wing. Peggy Olsen as the only sane woman on Mad Men. Then a handmaid. One thing about Us that was crazy was the idea of playing two versions of the same person that are completely separate entities, another role she smashed.But that is all just a lead up. The Invisible Man uses classic acting techniques and old filming lessons to reimagine a story in a way that makes you glad everyone is visible. What could things be made to look like when you can only see half of the equation? Moss talks to no one, pantomimes, fights thin air, and shows that her acting range is to infinity and beyond. I thought the only weakness of this film, was not picking a more intimidating actor who could help balance her immense power. It seemed as though, eventually, Adrian would be gobbled up by the sheer force of Moss. But apples are apples and oranges are oranges.This movie is tense. The opening scene nearly gives you a stroke even though literally nothing happens. This is how you film a movie that would otherwise be much less. Use the elements and the angles to create more. Drop in a wind speed ascending tornado of an actress and you have a totally visible outcome."
198,"Some says it is hard to Watch... I agree, it makes me want to hit myself with a pen 2 times in both eyes. It takes a lot of blinded ignorance from all the characters not to realize before what's happening. Especially when the Movie's Director show clearly a lots of security camera taking the NOT invisible man. And even after that nobody trust Elisabeth Moss. That's enough to make a lot of people stop watching the movie before the end.(So frustrating) It's sad, cause otherwise it could maybe really worth a 7.5/10 rating."
199,"Probably the stupidest, worst movie I have ever seen! Don't do it!!!"
200,"Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) flees from the isolated mansion of her husband, the awarded physician Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), with the support of her sister Emily Kass (Harriet Dyer) during the night. Cecilia claims that Adrian is an abusive husband and Emily¬¥s friend Police Detective James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) lodges her at home in the room of his daughter Sydney Lanier (Storm Reid). When Adrian surprisingly dies, Cecilia inherits his fortune. But when weird things happen with Cecilia, her sister and friends, Cecilia believes Adrian is invisible but not dead and is sent to a psychiatric clinic. Is Cecilia insane?""The Invisible Man"" is an absolutely overrated film. The screenplay is not good, with many plot holes and with poor development of Adrian Griffin and Cecilia Kass, performed by Elisabeth Moss, looks like a crazy and unbalanced woman most of the time. The viewer never sees the claimed abuses of Adrian and how Cecilia finds that he is invisible in the beginning is a great mystery. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""O Homem Invis√≠vel"" (""The Invisible Man"")"
201,"What otherwise could have been a great movie was ultimately let down by plot conveniences, plot holes and poor writing"
202,"After the Upgrade (2018), I was hyped to see another interesting story from Whannell.I can say right away that I wasn't disappointed this time either.The Invisible Man (2020) was an effective and engaing yet very simple revenge film. The basic structure of the story is very simple and is very predictable, but only because they set everything up and provide the necessary motivation. They also never present this film as a mystery, because there is none, really. Even the ""twist"" was foreseeable.The film itself is a psychological thriller with elements of science fiction and horror, all of which work together nicely.Elisabeth Moss is great, as always, it was also nice to see Benedict Hardie from Upgrade. Aldis Hodge has a good supporting performance, but he isn't given enough screen time in my opinion, just as Oliver Jackson-Cohen, I really wish they would give us more insight into his character's absolutely vile psyche of a manipulative control freak.The film messes up its pace in the end a little, but the ending, while being obvious, still delivers and feels satisfying.It's a little too long, somewhat unrealistic, and you can see the writers coming back and doing re-writes to establish the ending, but overall, if you suspend your disbelief just a little you will enjoy it.A good watch, and far more superior than that Hollow Man (2000) film nobody remembers."
203,"What a waste of film. The movie started off slow and then finally built up to something interesting. By the end, it returned to dreadful. The ending was so ridiculous and wants the audience to assume a lot to fill in the plot hole.SPOILER: Expecting us to believe that Elizabeth Moss was wearing the suit to kill him is ridiculous. She wouldn't have had the time to put the suit on, change out of it, and return to scream and make the phone call to the police in the amount of time that they show. Ridiculous ending for what could have been a decent movie."
204,"First few scenes there are some continuity problems, like being in socks then suddenly having shoes on, wow amazing how she got them on so fast. It just keeps on going. Cuts to scenes where she's running down a hall, next thing she's in a car...wow how did she get there and the invisible hubby did't get to her. It's so predicable and it gets boring real fast. I got sick of all the fight scenes. There's one good scene that's a shock. Won't say when though, but by the end I just wanted it to be over. I am surprised Elisabeth Moss did this film to be honest."
205,"I'm seeing a lot of you on here trashing a movie titled ""The Invisible Man"" for being ""Unrealistic"". Just let that sink in for a moment. When you see a movie labeled as ""Sci-Fi"", it means that it's Science Fiction. Not really meant to be realistic."
206,The trailer set good expectations for the movie. There was hardly a story line or plot that was developed apart from the fact that the hero was an invisible man. Screenplay was really bad. All at the screens started becoming restless towards the end of the movie.
207,"Leigh Whannell successfully continues cementing his status as one of the best mainstream horror filmmakers with adding his effective modern rendition of ""The Invisible Man"" to his filmography. It's most certainly the best Invisible man since 1933, putting a new meaning on the words reboot, re-imagining, modernization, call it what You will. A powerhouse performance, the horror of abuse, good atmosphere building and technical aficionados behind the cameras and computers are what truly make this film. Of course, there are also some flaws.""The Invisible Man's"" only and biggest problem is its story, and I don't mean the effectively served themes of abuse, being controlled and utter helplessness. I mean the mystery behind the invisible man, the surface plot, twists and such. Predictability is the only thing that bummed me out a little, there are two major twists and I saw them coming much sooner than I'd wish to. Apart from that, the character and dialogue writing is great, it's just the eventually ""The Invisible Man"" is more of a by-the-numbers horror, just expertly executed, except for one or two simple logic issues in some action scenes. For its 2 hours runtime, the pacing is pleasantly consistent all throughout. Elisabeth Moss, the absolute star of ""The Invisible Man"", puts on a tough performance, portraying a scarred character on a sanity challenging road in search of freedom, effectively keeping the movie grounded in reality. The rest of this movie's horror magic is in the cinematography, editing and special FX, all of which seem to be nailed near to perfection, setting mood with empty spaces, impending danger and flawless, impressive special effects. The original score fills in whatever room for more sauce there's left. At this point, Whannell's name in a project always means a visually and atmospherically striking movie.Coincidentally I watched 1933's ""The Invisible Man"" for the first time last year, shortly before finding out there's a remake coming out & I'm happy to say that for me both of them are on par - same, yet vastly different and amazing in their own ways. One thing's exactly the same though - both impress with special effects. My rating: 8/10."
208,"H.G. Wells's sci-fi novella ""The Invisible Man"" makes for rich cinematic potential; it's a much better unseen movie than it ever was a book. That's because it's based on sight, and so a visual medium such as cinema does the concept more justice than the literary form. I've seen a few film versions since reading it, including the five classic Universal ones from the 1930s and 1940s, plus a couple Invisible Man appearances in Abbott and Costello parodies, as well as Paul Verhoeven's lousy ""Hollow Man"" (2000) and unseen characters in everything from a B-picture such as ""The Amazing Transparent Man"" (1960) to a throwaway gag in Woody Allen's ""Alice"" (1990). Maybe three or four out of all these pictures realize the cinematic potential of the material, and this 2020 rebooting is one of them. Other reviewers have mentioned the allegory for not believing and gaslighting victims of an abuse they don't see, which is apt, but this picture, including the female empowerment, is much deeper than that visually.The original 1933 film was made when synchronized sound was still relatively new in Hollywood, and so it played with the notion of visual spectacle and the bodily presence of actors vanishing in favor of a focus on the voice and audio mediums, including the telephone and radio. The underrated sequel, ""The Invisible Man Returns"" (1940) elaborated upon the semiotics of cinema's indexicality by way of the traces that a concealed body continues to leave behind. The also underrated ""The Invisible Woman"" (1940), meanwhile, had fun with inverting the traditionally-male gaze with the female character's not-to-be-looked-at-ness.In hindsight, this 2020 version, unlike its predecessors, is from the perspective of the victim and woman instead of the crazy mad doctor or otherwise malevolent or mischief-making see-through figure. Partly, it's an abuse/rape revenge slasher flick. From the opening sequence, however, it becomes clear that there's an advanced notion of the role of the camera, as well as of technology and a motif of water as metaphor (which also plays into the importance of liquid in catching a transparent trespasser--traces again). (As a further digression, I would like to think the opening breaking of the waves references the shared themes of control of women and sex in Lars von Trier's 1996 drama.) Their home is a modern panopticon, covered in surveillance cameras and alarms. As for the cinematographic apparatus for the movie proper, there's the first of what turns out to be several pans and cuts throughout to empty spaces, as if a character were there and, perhaps, because they are. This set-up was the whole idea behind Jeremy Bentham's panopticon--down to the design to control one's thoughts by them internalizing being watched. Ironically, at least at first, however, it's the imprisoned, punny-named protagonist, ""Cee"" (an evermore impressive Elisabeth Moss), who is the architect.Recalling the 1933 film (besides the appreciated Easter eggs), technology figures highly into the control and surveillance here. Besides the invisibility outfit and the surveillance equipment, Cee covers the lens of her webcam out of privacy concerns--hiding herself electronically just as she does by physical location and choice of association. Her email is exploited to steal her identity. She benefits from tech, too, though, as a vibrating smartphone first alerts her to turning the tables on her stalker. There's even the Uber ride she calls for to escape (her fleeing, appropriately, also covered on and seen from the point of view of another surveillance camera).For the most part, the cinematic gaze follows Cee through different spaces, which plays into a familiar pattern of the visual pleasure derived from cinema, of women's supposed to-be-looked-at-ness and the association of the gaze with the male gender--as previously dealt with in one of the aforementioned 1940 films. Psychoanalytic feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey's famous essay, too, is all about this. In a sense, the camera is already an invisible man, and by association of our gaze with that of the camera, we, the spectator, too, are invisible. We see but are unseen by the characters. This puts the camera and the spectator in the position of the baddie here, the Invisible Man. In a lot of ways, this paradigm is similar to that of one of the first great slasher flicks, ""Halloween"" (1978), where we shared the gaze of the masked (and, thus, partly unseen) murderer, as it, along with the knives, was wielded to stalk horny teenagers turned victims. Jamie Lee Curtis's character challenged this at the level of the look, including by unmasking her assailant--and, by association, the spectator.This ""Invisible Man"" redoubles all of this. Instead of some serum, chemical cocktail, rays, atomic radiation or what have you, invisibility here is achieved by bunches of cameras and a system of projection, as it is with the role of the spectator to the filmed picture in front of us. Cee, then, attacks the gaze at its source through the cinematographic apparatus (not entirely unlike ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" (2019), come to think of it). I even appreciate the pacing of this picture and the embrace of long moments of silence, although I see how some may find it slow or not scary, but this isn't a movie about jump scares, gore and base thrills. While the score is serviceable, there's no need to replicate, say, John Carpenter's iconic music. ""The Invisible Man"" is about seeing. The best part may be the last scene: her exploitation of the surveillance--audio and visual--and its perspective, her repurposing of the gaze by possession of the camera-ed suit, and, finally, she looks directly at the camera--right at the spectator, returning the gaze. As she shares in our seeing, we're no longer invisible. Then, she blinks, fade to black, and the looking disappears."
209,"Overacted. Over dramatic, poorly written. Painful dialog. Plot Holes. Too many ideas."
210,This movie was way better than what I expected it to be. It was awesome def worth seeing
211,This should have been a lifetime movie. I don't see the allure in making what was a good idea into a one sided drama about a girl torments by something she can't see. I don't care about her problems. I want some invisible man
212,"Now I'm no Neil De'Grasse Tyson by any means but the common sense issues in this movie made it unbearably frustrating to watch came within the first 20%.The main character received 100k a month from her ""deceased"" ex and if she would have only spent $1000 on cameras (which is common even without the invisible man in this day & age) she would have proven her case after her firts encounter with him. I mean she could have even livestreamed her daily life on instagram lol.If she wanted to go big she could have gotten a thermal imaging camera to prove someone was there with her."
213,"This is The Handmaids Tale with an invisible misogynist who terrorises his poor wife who, asserting her feminist virtues, turns survivalist tough lady.That's essentially what you get here. Much as I think Elizabeth Moss is terrific and enjoyed The Handmaids Tale, its hard for me not to perceive this as yet more politically correct posturing, from a rather jaded Hollywood.On the upside Moss's performance is predictably excellent and there are some decent scares but for me, this still feels like PC lecturing as much as it is entertainment.A dismayed 5/10."
214,"Well I was going to give this film a higher rating because I actually thought it was pretty good. But now after learning it's Me Too Feminist cause it's lost a few points from me.The film centers on Cecelia, a woman who is trying to escape her abusive husband, Adrian, who is very controlling. He has cameras around the house & even wants to have a baby for the sheer hell of keeping her by his side more often, if not for good. She escapes, but after 2 weeks strange things start happening. Quilt covers get pulled off her when sleeping, her port folio gets sabotaged when she's in a job interview, a nasty email under Cecelia's name gets sent to her sister & many other things. It is then she tries to figure out how to expose her husband & most importantly, get everyone to believe her before she goes insane.I found the film to be quite good, great effects, good scares, great action. It was dark, sinister & pretty creepy. But. The films cause to try & elevate the feminist propaganda is what let's the film down. I feel the whole Me Too shoehorning has gone too far in Hollywood. Sure, the film wasn't as bad as Blumhouse's last film Black Christmas which was unholy crap to say the least. I don't understand why Hollywood is insistent on shoehorning Propaganda in today's films. I understand domestic abuse is an issue even now in today's society, but why does it always have to always favour women & to please the man hating feminists & Me Too crowd? Men are victims of domestic too, but as usually gets sidelined in favour society's discrimination & of course Hollywood, which isn't helping.Why they make films to further push the agenda & side the true victims & awareness is beyond me. The film was great for a horror/thriller, but the case just simply ruins it & it's not even a cause that's needed. Anything to sideline men I guess.4/10"
215,"The story line was well built. however, I expected to know more about Adrian's character and how the suit is built and works!? as a thriller movie, it was really thrilling and made me keep watching and getting surprising. the only thing I find it a little confusing, is ""Cecilia could show the suit as evidence while she was in that medical center and save herself, but she didn't."" if Adrian was always around so he should have known about the place of the suit, which Cecilia had stolen and hidden. I think she could find the suit, but steal it after they killed Adrian's brother and made a plan to catch Adrian.
fortunately it was not so cliche and had good pitches and a proper ending. the acting was good as well."
216,Not too bad a film but so annoyingly dark that you cant see anything
217,"This is masterful horror/thriller filmmaking in its prime which takes advantage of it's limited setting and uses camerawork to it's full potential. With a villan, whose presence is always felt throughout with the ominouse sense of dread that never lifts throughout the entirety of the filmAn inventive and original plot structure that leaves *almost* everything revealed and no stone unturned. It was an extremely entertaining and emotionally satisfying horror/psychological thriller which made the best of it's very small budget and masterful directionJust go see it"
218,"So many reviewers with hatred for this film. I really don't get it? A lot of the plot holes talked about are easily explained. I'm not going to put spoilers in this review, but if those of you complaining can't work it out I'm afraid you might have to expand your mind.
In my opinion it was good fun, suspenseful with a little added gore. What's not to like?"
219,"This movie has no logic, the plot started with no background what so ever about any story line....I stop watching it after 15 minutes but I really doubt this become entertaining...."
220,"Please save your 2 dollar rental fee...this movie is that bad. Murky black dark beginning in which you cannot make ou faces or forms because it's so badly filmed and lit. This rates as one of the worst invisible man movies ever made. There are only a couple of fairly interesting moments and the rest of the film is undercut by poor plotting, ridiculous things happening, and the lamest ending of a modern film ever made. Surprise, this film is not even worth a $2 rental."
221,"This loose adaptation of author H. G. Wells 1897's book of the same name was initially going to be an installment in Universal Picture's share cinematic dark universe with Johnny Depp in the titular role. The movie handled by screenwriter David S Goyer would have the Invisible Man infiltrated Czarist Russia as a spy for the British Empire. However due to the underwhelming performance of both 2014 film 'Dracula Untold' & 2017 movie 'the Mummy' at the box office; the concept was then shelfed. Then the negative press about Depp's ugly divorce from wife Amber Heard began to surface as talks about domestic abuse hit the rounds. This cause Universal to drop the actor in favor of writer and director Leigh Whannel's progressive version in which the titular character now serves as an antagonist in a spousal abuse story to save face. For the most part, the plan kinda work. The film produced by Blumhouse didn't feel too misandry or over feminist propaganda. It really did find the balance when telling the tale of Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) being haunted by her abusive ex-lover Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson Cohen) after the inventor's apparent death. The thriller was mostly well shot. Stefan Duscio's cinematography was very effective. All the visuals ranging from establishing the coastal locations of the bay area to the spotless overlooking glass house give off a coldness feeling of being watched. The film never lets you forget the Invisible Man could be anywhere, with the camera often focusing on empty wide shots and the subtle clicking noise. I like that we never get a good look at villain's face until the very end of the movie. Even the opening 10 minutes of Cecilia trying to escape the house with little to no forced sound effects, dialogue and music was outstanding creepy. Show don't tell approach work so well during these moments. It's only after that, the film somewhat loose its edge when twist and turns are introduced such as Adrian wanted a baby from Cecilia. Then why does he put her in so much physical harm that might cause death or a miscarriage? It's jarring. Another thing, the whole inheritance subplot really doesn't go anywhere. If the idea is to make the woman go crazy to the point that everybody else would distance themselves and she will have no choice but to seek help from the Griffin family. Then why give her lots of money? I get that Adrian wanted to give her a false hope because he is sadistic, but that would only draw more people to help her overcome her problems. Theoretically it makes more sense to use the wealth to make Cecilia and himself disappear easier, seeing that everyone thinks he's dead & Cecilia just some insane woman. After all it did look like he made an invisible suit that is easy for Cecilia to control and wear. Plus, if anybody did find out the truth that he could just paid them off. Instead the ending really come off as very unrealistic. I really couldn't believe that the villain got away with the crimes nor he wouldn't see his demise coming. He had to knew that two of his suits were out there. Regardless Leigh has a very impressive eye for unusual action sequences. The hospital scene makes you wonder if Griffin had super strength and durability or was that coming from the suit. Even so it does beg the question why the villain didn't get a heat stroke in that suit as there seem to be no cooling setup. In real life he would be super weak and his smell would be very overpowering as he wouldn't be able to gain or save energy. At least in this version he wouldn't go immediately blind due to light not being able to hit his retinas as that would be protected. Regardless I doubt he would be able to see that good to fight off people. Regardless the first fight scene in the suit was intense and impressive even if it was bit odd that the Lanier family would leave Celica alone in their own house. Don't get me wrong the supporting cast was fine in their acting, but their characters really need to be expanded more. As for the main character. Moss's acting is solid. You really get the dread and anxiety. You can tell that Celica has it rough throughout the film. I just wish the movie play off the mystery more that it could all be in her head. The movie is way heavy handled when revealing the invisible man. Like the trailer, the film kinda spoils the mystery early on by illogically showing the killer using his cell phone when he really didn't need to. Despite that I really did like the foreshadowing involving the mosaic, jellyfishes, and mental health posters. I also found the symbolism with the names given to the character very interesting. After all Cecelia means blind, but everybody calls her C. Another thing I dig was all the shout outs and nods to the more well-known appearances of the Invisible Man including a scene where a fashion dummy wore similar clothes to the 1933 James Whale's film of the same name and much later a patient is shown in the mental hospital covered in bandages. Even the idea of Cecelia trying to clear her name is from the 1940 sequel 'The Invisible Man Returns'. It was also cool to see the mention of the tech company Cobolt from Whannel's 2018 Sci Fi flick 'Upgrade'. Along with that the dark ambience music from composer Benjamin Wallfisch was also nice to hear. Overall: Compare with Paul Verhoeven's 2000 film 'Hollow Man'. This movie certainly stood out for its better loosely modern fresh take of the novel. The movie is easy to find as it was made available on video on demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It's one flick that you shouldn't turn a blind eye too."
222,"I liked this movie but I expected a bit more. It was very predictable, I also hoped for some jump scares but sadly no. It is too bad because I think it has a very good potential and a nice plot."
223,"Like the opening how it all starts, begin was a bit slow, but when it progress it was beautiful. I think only some points are just too unrealistic especially when the main character is getting pushed away from her social network. The contradicting character of the male head player is just not understandable maybe also it makes it a mystery what leave unsolved. The end is just too easy to also very open, so it could be a second part (what could be lame how they dealt with details during this movie).What I do like are the twists in the movie nog the normal story line.Worth to check see."
224,"A decent sophisticated sci-fi horror movie the title ""The Invisible Man"" is misleading as the man in question is visible throughout the movie."
225,Was hoping this would be good and it was! Starts out very slow and you have to keep with it. Not sure the technology would work regarding all the invisible suit aspect but just suspend belief for the film.This film has stayed with me and its well worth a watch.
226,"Now you see him, now you don't. Is it a ghost? Perhaps so, but today's subject happens to be the Invisible Man. Though he got his start in the H.G. novel of the same name, a lot of people might remember him from the lineup of the classic Universal monsters. Unlike Dracula who has a sexual overtone or the Frankenstein monster who represents a science of unknown nature, the Invisible Man is an individual who has a dangerous power in his hands; an almost godlike power since no one can see him. He can pretty much strike without anyone knowing their being sought out for death.Now since the remake of The Mummy failed to kick start another cinematic universe of classic monsters, what does The Invisible Man need to do different? Since they are monsters first, it had to find a modern way to make him scary. In the direction it takes, it explores toxic relationships and the psychology behind the dominating force. While it can happen to anyone, it unfortunately happens to women more often. Does the movie try to say something against men? No, The Invisible Man keeps to a smart situation by making the victim relatable no matter what gender.It starts with a young woman Cecilia (played by Elisabeth Moss) making an escape from her abusive but intelligent boyfriend Adrian Griffin (played by Oliver Jackson-Cohen). She escapes his large compound and barley gets away in her sister Emily's car when he tries to pursue her. She is taken to Emily's ex husband James (played by Aldis Hodge) and daughter Sydney (played by Storm Reid) to hide out where she's convinced Adrian will find her. News comes when it's said that Adrian had committed suicide. To add on more, in his will he left Cecilia five million dollars assumed she's mentally competent.She tries to move on with her life, but even in death, she's not safe. At first little things start to happen like stoves being left on or her portfolio work turning up missing at a big interview. But when she senses his presence and even catches random things flying around, she's sure that Adrian has sound a way to become invisible just to torture her. Of course no one believes her, but it's made worse when emails are sent to make her look back and people get hurt. Will Cecilia be able to prove her case and find her invisible stalker?The Invisible Man has the advantage of being both large and claustrophobic; as if you have a ghost consistently following you. You are always on the brink of figuring out if the invisible man is close or far away from Elizabeth Moss. It all has to do with here it wants her mind to be. The Invisible Man brilliantly makes her personality the type that would not only have fallen into this guys trap, but would have made her to be debatable if she is of sound mind.All of it works thanks to Elizabeth Moss who is the kind of modern scream queen I want to see; someone who is half terrified by what could happen but a general curiosity to figure out how to stop it. I don't know if I can call her a feminist hero, but the movie shows what I call ""good feminism""; the kind of feminism of her trying to fight against a man hurting her without slamming all men in general. Of course no one would believe a dead boyfriend coming back from the dead and had turned himself invisible. The movie continues to stack cards against her and she pushes forward.The overall story doesn't put her ahead of him. The script does show him as much of a brilliant tactician as he is a sick individual who can't let go of anything. There's probably another story worth telling even before this started; one that shows her as a different woman before she fell into this relationship. Without saying what he does, he puts her into a position where you know this guy needs to die in order prevent a worse monster from being unleashed. I would love to see this a part of a larger universal monster cinematic universe.I'll give this nine invisible men out of ten. Though I wish the movie would have put her nerves front and center a little longer with more of a debate whether an invisible person could exist, it's a modern slasher that I hope aspiring storytellers can take notes from. It channels classic horror tropes with fear, then creates a sickening fear before ending the nightmare. I highly recommend this for any fan of horror and thrillers."
227,"I didn¬¥t know this name or associated it with anything whatsoever until i saw Upgrade. This is what cinema is! Makes you want to see more no matter what the story is about. From now on i¬¥ll see all movies directed by this man. Writing or acting is just not enough for him. And, as i finished this movie i thought... ""%$""#% maybe i¬¥ve just seen one of the best horror movie this year so now all look not good enough :)"
228,"The only problem with this movie is the title, because it could make some people think about other ""invisible man"" stories , but this is not the case.
A ""must see"" movie"
229,"The best thriller film in the past five years. It is not a simple b-grade plasma film.Nor is it a pure, low-budget, traditional horror film. The first half of the paragraph pays attention to create a scary atmosphere. It makes good use of the long lens to create psychological fear and improve artistic attiy. If the camera pan on the left or right puts the audience in the invisible person's perspective, many places make people sweat. The heroine ""kill"" sister as the front and back dividing line, the second half of the sci-fi action. The scene was so bold and unexpected that I couldn't help but exclaim it was enough to go do in horror film history."
230,"I did a double feature watching bad boys 2 and this which are both rated a 7 on imdb. no way bad boys is a 7. it is 5 or 6 at most. but invisible man def. deserved the rating.
kept me intrigued up until the last scene.7.2"
231,"Don't make any sense.
The only thing invisible is logic."
232,Watch the first 10 minutes and you'll know exactly how the rest will play out. I am very disappointed.
233,I really like this movie. I've been waiting for a long time to watch. Elizabeth Moss is an amazing actress. there is nothing bad I can say about this movie.
234,"The Invisible Man is more thriller than horror but effective none the less. Well acted, well produced and beautifully shot. A great movie that was able to get my mind off of the COVID19 pandemic and held my interest all the way through."
235,"The Invisible Man is a pleasant surprise in February, a month that is not famous for premiering films that are very good, however sometimes these kinds of surprises are released, a film that is a remake of a 1933 film and at the same time a adaptation of a book by HG Wells, one of the greatest and most innovative geniuses of science fiction. How would a story from more than 100 years ago fit today? This film succeeds and with honors, manages to cover current issues but maintaining the original premise, it is a story that has parallels to other science fiction movies in which man abandons his real form to become something else, this film is not exactly a mutant transformation like David Cronenberg's The Fly, but it is about a man who plays with technology to improve his skills, although it does not show the same level of depth as The Thing, it is a very well made film whose story is quite flat but satisfactory.The Invisible Man constantly breaks his own internal logic, has great technical achievements, very well directed, can be seen in some scenes, as the main scene that shows that the director knows how to create suspense and also shows an ability to make us feel that there is someone in between but we cannot see it, just feel it, this same resource is repeated later, an action scene that is made as a long shot is simply fascinating, another conventional film has action scenes full of unnecessary cuts that do not let the action taste at the moment, for that reason this scene is exemplary. The performance of Elizabeth Moss also gives many points to this film."
236,Worst scenario ever. Bad actings. I thought it would be a psychological thriller but it was absolute rabish. Nothing made any sense. DONT WATCH IT
237,"I was really disappointed, I don't understand why the characters have to be unviable as if I were watching an old horror where the runaway teenagers fall when they are being chased by the killer, which does not annoy them but frightens them and the logical bucks. .. SPOILER: Do you wipe the paint off in seconds? there is no camera in the restaurant? etc .."
238,"One of the worst movies I have seen over the last few years. Elizabeth Moss tries and fails to lend emotional nuance to this endless sequence of hollow, mechanistic hocus-pocus. Now you see it, now you don't - who could give a monkey's, and why could this ever get such a high rating?"
239,"Is this a real movie. I am verry dissapointed. No horror, no thriller. Just loose time."
240,Interesting concept of an invisible man but very poorly executed. Boring movie and very low budget. Also a lot of things do not make sense and had a horrific ending.
241,"I have to admit my expectations were a bit on the high side walking into this one. Although normally I try to keep them in check because so many movies are utterly disappointing. Well I'm happy to sat this film completely blew me away. Leigh Whanell has created his masterpiece. A super update inspired by the invisible man but something completely new altogether. The brilliant Elizabeth Moss stars as Cecelia a damaged woman in an abusive, controlling marriage. As we begin the film she escapes and soon after finds that her ex has committed suicide. Following that she discovers that she will inherit five million dollars as long as she doesn't commit any crimes or is ruled mentally incompetent. All of that is a red herring for what's to come. Soon after she comes to realize that her new found freedom is an illusion and that her sociopathic ex is stalking her but is invisible. I don't want to get into the details because I refuse to spoil this for anyone but wow. From the opening moments Whannel concocts a mounting feeling of chest tightening dread and keeps it uncomfortably fluid throughout. The small moments of laughter and a feeling of freedom are only to distract you from what's coming. And trust me it's worth the wait. The film unfolds unexpectedly is utterly driven by Moss's vulnerable yet resilient performance. She's so smart and driven it's easy to root for her and to relate to her seemingly hopeless plight. The film succeeds in establishing Adrian as an utter monster. And the invisibility is a device that works so well because had he been given a steady face and performance, it would have humanized him. And it's all the more effective that it didn't. Despite being a reimagining this is a really new film. It feels fresh in every aspect and even though you might think you know what's going to happen the utter brilliance in which it's executed is utterly astounding."
242,"Writer/director Leigh Whannell did a solid job in directing, but the story certainly had some plot and technical issues. A little more info about Cecilia's relationship with her sister and especially her friend was needed. But Elisabeth Moss' outstanding performance elevated the tension and thrills the story gave us, and without her, I don't think this film would've been as good. The score was perfect and was a huge part in creating the suspense, as was the cinematography. Casting and performances were also decent. The 124 min runtime flew by with perfect pacing. A must-see for fans of this genre."
243,Such a stupid movie. Satan definitely knows how to attract the young people with the Illuminati leaders in Hollywood: Wells' original science fiction story is no longer present in this draft of a storyline and all which remains is an ordinary horror movie. Disgusting.
244,"Cecilia (Elizabeth Moss) escapes from her abusive boyfriend. Two weeks later she is still living in fear, but she's soon informed that her ex-boyfriend has committed suicide. Cecilia inherits a large fortune from his will. Now feeling free of her dark past, she tries to move on and start a fresh life. All is going well until she begins to have suspicions that her dead ex-boyfriend might not be dead after all. Now a mysterious ""Invisible Man"" figure is destroying her life and the ones around her. Walking into my preview screening I was extremely excited to see a film bringing ""The Invisible Man"" back into the horror and thriller genre. While the title feels like a remake, I welcomed it because it feels so long since movie lovers had An Invisible Man film (Hollow Man - 2000 comes to mind). Elizabeth Moss does a fantastic job playing the lead. A character who is dealing with an abusive past and questioning a new ""invisible presence"" would be a challenge to play on screen, but I'm proud to confess that she's quite enjoyable in this role. As for suspense there is lots of it here. For the most part these moments were creative and it's obvious the director is avoiding the typical jump scares. However, as a plot I found ""The Invisible Man"" predictable to the point where it even annoyed me. Perhaps some viewers won't be bothered with element like myself. When questions are raised earlier in the film and viewers instantly know the answer before the reveal at the end that's a movie sin. I feel a couple of better edits for these predictable twists would have made them more ""invisible"" to figure out. This also takes away moments of enjoyment and shock when a film is consistently obvious. As for effects they were also great. There is lots of creativity as to how this invisible presence starts to ruin Cecilia's life and haunt her. I can't speak negatively about the visual effects. The film's audio was also a nice compliment to the visuals as it felt futuristic and gave a sci-fi vibe, similar to films such as ""Upgrade"" 2018 (same director). Overall, The Invisible Man gave me expectations of something new with a fresh type of story. While the film's CGI effects, suspense & performances are generally solid, the film's plot and key moments were incredibly predictable throughout. As you can understand, this takes away all the pleasure I was truly wanting to have from this film. Overall it's still enjoyable to be sure, but I confess, I wish it was better.
6.6/10 - Walkden Entertainment"
245,"I wanted to like it, but the last act doesn't make sense. If Tom is the invisible man, why does his brother have a chamber that can make you invisible in the first place? Why was he so violent in the beginning when the wife drove off and acted so innocent towards the end? What job does Adrian have? How could someone be invisible with a black suit shown at random?"
246,"I can't understand why this movie got even 7 as the rating, this deserved 1 star at best if zero is not possible. This movie is horrible, full of plot-holes, characters and stories both didn't get proper development, illogical story line. Let's see what's we have here:1. Incomprehensible acts doing by the main character (and everybody else in this movie, but MC was the most annoying here) for ex. there are so many chances for her to have evidences needed to uncover and revealed the truth but she always did the opposite and made the story more...complicated (or let's say, stupid)2. There's no background story of MC and Adrian to convince us about their problematic relationship and how things ended up like it did. Why Adrian was so obsessed with her?never explained.3. Every element such as characters or stories told by the MC herself narratively. I think there should be a better way to unfold the plot, yet they choose the most boring one : let the MC describes about the whole plot4. Near the end of the movie, there was a scene revealed the villain killed and Adrian locked in the room to show that he was innocent from the beginning. I didn't buy it, nobody impressed by it. After that, the rest of the story was pretty much predictable."
247,"Human beings are certainly interesting. I would like to begin with talking about the actual movie. It was simply put, amazing. Excellent directing and a really intriguing story about abuse and how it affects people. Now onto what I really wanted to write about, that being all of these negative reviews on IMDB. I find it interesting that 90% of all the bad reviews are a 1/10. Seriously guys...It is basic knowledge that if you rate the movie a 1/10 you want to make a clear statement about something that is not the quality of the movie itself. It seems like most of these 1/10 - 4/10 reviews are about how BAD the movie is for focusing on a woman. This is insane, people! Are we living in the 18th century. You don't have to whine about the lead being a woman and if you have a problem with it then don't watch the movie. The other negative reviews are about plot holes.Yes there are some inconsistencies but no more than in other movies that I guarantee you that you rank higher than this one. You see, when you already have an agenda and want the movie to fail, then you nitpick these things that are not meant to be looked into. It is a horror movie for god sake, it is not meant to make 100% sense. Get a life people!"
248,"Really I don't like horror films, but this one I like. Why? First of all, the plot is good, the storyis really interesting, you follow the action and decisions of main characters. Secondly, it's good idea to make thd invisibility more technological. Thirdly, grafics is comfortable to watch. Disadvantage is not good actors' performance, sometimes I didn't believe in characters' emotions.
So, it's good horror film"
249,Elizabeth Moss is phenomenal in this horror movie. Surprise ending wows you
250,"This movie will definitely move your nerves and make you cringe as it is suspenseful, gripping and heart-stopping. Dont miss this film!"
251,Acting was good but the script was thin.Plot holes you could drive a truck through.I almost left the theater as the movie lost me within 20 minutes.
252,I hate the ending at the beginning I kinda of loved the trill but it became too much
253,"I have been watching movies since 24 years...and this is the worst movie I watched in years. The bolt is full of wholes, the main actor acting is so over and unnatural and the story of so predictable. Offers nothing new and really really bad sci-fi or horror. I can't find a right gender for this. This is BAD. And most of all so shocked for the 7.4 rating...can't understand what the high rating for. Really shocking!!! I know I sound harsh but believe me, this film is a disaster!!!"
254,"Just don't please. You can use these 120 minutes in way more productive ways.
Bad plot, superficial carachthers, mediocre acting... I thought it would be kind of psychological thriller but no, it's just a very bad movie."
255,"The concept could have worked as a good horror if executed well. IF. I dont agree with people calling it unrealistic, its literally got a suit made of cameras so it's about as realistic as iron man. But theres so many glaring plot holes, and poor decisions from the ""protagonist"" that I didn't sympathise or invest myself in the charecter. Forgettable and truly god awful film. 0 out of 10 if it was possible."
256,"7.5? Really? No way! I wonder who pays the reviewers. I wouldn't give two stars.. Total waste of time. Bad acting, bad everything.., just a really bad movie. Don't waste you time."
257,"To my surprise, this is a really good movie, in the first 10 minutes you are absorbed into the story and your heart starts to beat faster than normal and as the events go on the tension goes up and up until a moment when you think it will calm down and it gets even worse (whoever saw the movie knows what I'm talking about), in the end I even questioned what I was watching. The music is present in a few scenes but when it is, it helps a lot in the atmosphere and the performances were also very solid, mainly by Elizabeth Moss who surprised me. It is a smart and well executed story, hopefully we had more films like this. Surprise!"
258,"When I first heard of this movie, I thought it would be something like modern version of The Hollow Man (2000). But, no. This movie isn't even half as good as the hollow man. The storyline is just pathetic and narrow, surrounding around a couples personal conflicts. The movie doesn't even cares to show how the invisiblity (invisiblity suit) was made possible. Just the character appearing invisible, that's it. What a joke on the name of horror/thriller movie."
259,Clich√©. Predictable. Poorly acted. Underwhelming. You can see the very few decent parts in the trailer. I am truly puzzled about the good reviews.
260,"Script needs some work but the performances and directing really drive the film to a pulp. The beautiful shots and compelling dialogue with acting across the board make for quite a ride. The tension is there and the thrills are chilling, some things could have been executed better and certain plot holes here and there but overall this is solid. You'd be lying to yourself if you would rank this any lower, it's not bad."
261,"I don't see what makes this movie horror. With all the imaginary high technology, it was like seeing a DC comic book adaptation. If you can overlook the ¬´ sleeping with the enemy ¬ª sub-plot, of course. And it's no coincidence I quoted this movie, when the same topic was handled in a lot more intriguing way, with less stereotypical characters. And that ending... It probably gave some activists, living vicariously through it, a ¬´ sawgasm ¬ª, but I thought it was lazy writing at its worst. Actually the whole movie is, with characters so one dimensional you don't believe for a second the choices/things they do in the movie. Hopefully there won't be a sequel."
262,"Don't waste your time with this. There are so many plot holes that you are grinding your teeth together because of the frustration if you have even two functioning brain cells. Very bad movie, just watch the original."
263,"This was a weird movie, though not bad. I wouldn't even mind watching it a second time. Though I just lost interest and couldn't keep it.Skip5 stars"
264,"After watching this I was wondering what the Johnny Depp 'Invisible Man' movie would have been like if 'The Mummy' movie was better received. This movie felt low budget and I thought the acting wasn't great. What you know about the invisible man comes from the main actress telling people about him. If the Johnny Depp movie was made he would of had a good amount of screen time, we would of known him without someone just telling us about him."
265,"When I first saw the trailer for this film, I was cautiously optomistic about its potential. Then I watched it. And everything changed.The opening few scenes and escape weren't bad. But, it only went downhill from there. Secondary characters that had nothing of importance to do in the film, forced conflict between character we know too little about to give a crap. And one incredibly stupid decision by the main character that could have brought the whole story to an end long before it did.The invisibility suit effects were pretty good however, and that is pretty much this films only redeeming quality, that and the dog (I love dogs) are the only reasons this film even gets the 2 stars I have given it.If you have a mind for logic, and any need for intelligent characters, give this one a miss."
266,"It would be better if whole this story turned out to be her ill/sick imagination. But no, it's just corny and predictable. Boring."
267,"She cruelly killed her husband without any evidence that he did all that things .. (not his brother). Just because he said the word ""surprise"". What?
I have to believe she is GOOD person?
The whole story was told from HER perspective. We forced to think her husband is bad. But the things not so simple.
I'm dissapointed. Waste of time."
268,"Poor poor poor, very very overrated, could have been much better."
269,"The best thing about this movie starts and ends with it starring Elisabeth Moss. I was left with so many damn questions after watching it that I just couldn't ignore.
Why did his brother help him?
Who was her friend to her (the guy she stayed with)?
What did she do with the second suit?
Why were there 2 suits and why OH WHY did he leave them out?
Why did he kill all those people at the prison when he didnt wanna get found out?
How was she gonna get out of a murder charge just by going back to her husband?
When was it the invisible man his brother and not his brother?
How did nobody know he was in the attic?
How did he text his mobile phone ""SURPRISE"" when she had the phone?
I could go on and on but let's just say it started with a bang and ended with a head scratch."
270,"I thought this was a fairly good movie but it appears that a host of negative reviewers are intent on talking me out of it. Updated for a modern day audience, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) is an expert in the field of optics research, having developed a suit that makes the wearer invisible. In the original 1933 film, Claude Rains' character is Dr. Jack Griffin, a scientist who accidentally conducts an experiment that renders him invisible, while at the same time affecting his mind, making him aggressive and dangerous. It appears that our modern day Griffin was already aggressive and dangerous to begin with before coming up with his invention, and it becomes Cecilia Kass's (Elisabeth Moss) goal to prove to those around her that she's not going insane when people around her become the victim of Griffin's acts of retribution and revenge.Now I do admit that there were some clumsy scenes that were used to demonstrate irrational behavior on Cecilia's part. The attack on Sydney (Storm Reid) was a huge question mark for me when it occurred because it didn't look like she was anywhere within arm's length distance of the young girl, and who can move that fast without being seen? Even the slashing of Emily's (Harriet Dyer) throat in the restaurant scene didn't present an aura of credibility about it, but in a crowded restaurant, how could Cecilia deny her involvement? However I was impressed throughout with actress Moss's descent into near madness regarding the events surrounding her.Probably more than anything, the film encourages me to go back to the original movie, because even though I remember it fairly well, when I pull it up here on IMDb, I find I rated it without having reviewed it, and for me that's a no-no. So just as soon as this corona induced isolation becomes history, I'll be looking it up at my local library."
271,"I am hard to please. This movie was much better than I expected....especially considering some of the bad reviews, The method was clever. It's a MOVIE, by the way.... it was entertaining and it met the objective."
272,"This movie is filled with pot holes. Counting from not using mobile camera for evidence to restaurant withiut cctv camera(yup police didn't even bothered to watch cctv footage! who needs evidence manh?)The leading character got one big opportunity to reveal she was right by obtaining the so called invisible suit and her top level IQ said to her... Let's hide this thing here in this very own house y should i carry it or rather wear it? I have to make sure the protagonist see that i'm here in his house.
Wowwwwww mindblowing"
273,"""The Invisible Man"" is a Mystery - Horror movie in which we follow a woman who escaped from her abusive husband and since then she is trying to continue her life while she is hiding from him. In a moment everything changes and she has to fight to prove the truth behind some mysterious incidents.I liked this movie very much because of its very interesting plot which consisted with some plot twists that made it even more interesting. The interpretation of Elisabeth Moss who played as Cecilia Kass was very good and she succeeded on making us understand what she is going through, her anger and her desperation. The direction which was made by Leigh Whannell was simply amazing and I liked the way he presented us the struggle of a person who is trying to find the truth and prove her innocence to the police. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that it will keep you in tense for the whole duration of it and you will enjoy it."
274,"Wasn't originally gonna write anything here but after reading some of the negative ""reviews"" here I feel like i have to put something.Great horror movies work on 2 levels. The first is the suspense and the atmosphere that the film is able to create. How the director is able to put Elizabeth Moss in a room by herself and have the audience on the edge of their seat with baited breath. Both anticipating and dreading what will happen next. That is what makes a horror movie fun on the first watch, the uneasiness and uncertainty of what might happen next. The second level that great horror movies work on is what the film is actually about, not the story but the message, what makes the film worth seeing again and again. At its core Invisible Man is about domestic abuse and the trauma and PTSD that can follow. How it can ruin someones life and make it almost impossible for them to continue their life, even after the abuse has ceased. How abuse can isolate an individual and alienate them from their closest family and friends. And even how difficult it can be sometimes to convince people outside of abusive relationships that the abuse is even happening. And its pretty obvious, or at least I thought it was.When I see people complaining about the ""plot holes"" and criticizing how a phone could fit in the invisible suit (modern phones are very slim so not actually a problem) or even why he would carry it (there is a very obvious reason right in front of your face watch it again) or whether or not a millionaire would use an invisible suit for harassing his ex instead of stealing state secrets (really? this is a horror suspense movie not a heist movie) why Elizabeth Moss character did some of the things she did that don't make sense (when people are in abusive situations they don't always make the best decisions, real people are not emotionless automatons) and the ""criticisms"" go on.Ultimately this movie really brings to light the fundamental flaws with modern online film ""criticism"". It isn't about dissecting a film and figuring out the directors motivations or what deeper meaning may be in the text or even what the films theme or message is. Its about nitpicking minute details that actually have not effect on the quality of the film and getting hung up on the smallest of details.Pointing out ""plot holes"" is not valid criticism."
275,"Starts by Cecilia leaving her husband, the a series of coincidences start to happen and she starts proving she is being hunted by someone invisible, the movie is really good for a horror and sci-fi keep that in mind and you have to finish the movie to like it.
Staring the amazing Elizabeth Moss and oliver Jackson, director and writer is Leigh Whannel he also made the Insidious"
276,"This film about invisible people is less cliches than previous ones, and it will also feel like a substitute in 2020. Is the feminism, is a new era of gender equality, the heroine is domestic violence, the film is very good-looking Japanese acting has much to do, she most cases are no rights pass without physical performance, tying to face boyfriend fear, in the face of other people's peculiar eye of helpless and finally back to kill her boyfriend's firm and hard to let a person admire the acting of the heroine."
277,"At first i thought it might be an amaetor horror movie with a poor narrative! But it had a brilliant ending! Mysterious enough to watch it til the last minute! Full of actions! You WILL like it
I also respect other reviews about this movie!"
278,"Is this an exceptional thriller? Honestly no, But it's a good one and I would certainly recommend it to anyone,The ups:Elizabeth Moss was really good,The film was really well made in it's attention to details and cinematography,The director did a great job in making you feel this unseen malicious threat's presence,The downs:After a certain point in the movie the villain's presence fades away,He didn't get more intimidating,The opposite actually, I was looking for more complexity I'm his character bit that didn't happen,and that's really disappointing.But still it's a good movie overall."
279,"Invisibility means that threats are everywhere and just represent the mood of the hostess. Mainly in the atmosphere to create, a lot of slow movement of empty lens, will let you follow the protagonist together paranoid, will feel that the seemingly empty place, whether there is really something hidden. The female master's performance is also very good, after all, there are many pieces of non-physical action drama, or very test the performance ability. And, and try to perform, although I'm not crazy, but everyone else thinks I'm crazy. The combination of male PUA and domestic violence with this traditional horror theme is also dense, at least reasonable and reasonable. The end of the deal is still very feminist, very enjoyable. The overall observability is still good, on the basis of the classic terror setting, add more life, more real elements, let you find that such a terrorist incident, in fact, directly happened to us."
280,"This movie is still masterclass of horror to me, an instant favorite.That said, this'll be my spoiler thoughts on it because I just rewatched it and it definitely holds up on a second viewing. The movie opens with Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) going through this very well thought out plan and trying to escape her abusive relationship with her now ex-boyfriend. Let me just say, this movie never tells you outright what happened, it's all implied, and that's the scariest part. After she flees and drops her bottle of diazepam, it cuts to two weeks later and she's living with James (Aleks Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). I love this relationship and how it's not a romantic one, it just makes you very happy for them and you feel Cecilia's development.
Then she finds out that Adrian killed himself, or did he? After they get back from a meeting with Tom, Adrian's younger brother, the movie changes, and for the better, and I love it even more! You start getting perspective shots of the titular Invisible Man, the first being when it cuts to down the hallway while Cecilia celebrates with James and Sydney. This is when you realize, this is no longer a house of three, it's a house of four.
After some very suspenseful and dreadful scenes that are masterfully crafted, Adrian sends an email through Cecilia's account saying things that drive Cecilia and her sister apart, and once she finds out she's crying on the floor when Sydney comes to comfort her, but then Adrian punches her in the face, hard, and she calls for her dad, James. Now this part could've been handled better, I believe James' character but Sydney was punched from an opposite side then Cecilia was on, and her immediate reaction was, ""Why'd you punch me Cecilia?"" So that just didn't work for me that much. James and Sydney then leave and Cecilia lays out coffee grounds to track Adrian's footprints, he doesn't cast any, but then she calls him and the phone is ringing from in the attic. She goes up and sees the phone, a bagged up knife, and her projects she's worked on that were missing in an earlier scene.
I have another problem, why didn't she take the phone to James or the police and say, ""Hey, my crazy, invisible ex has been stalking me and tearing my life apart, here's some evidence."" As she shows them the picture of her and Sydney sleeping. Again, weird. Also she dumps white paint on the invisible suit and Adrian washes it off with a kitchen sink, yeeeeahhhhh, no. I would've bought it if he went in the shower but the sink? That's a little bit too far for me. She then goes to Adrian's house form the beginning and finds a second suit that she stores away in the place she hid her bags in in the beginning of the movie. Okay. She gets in a scuffle with Adrian and leaves.
Now it's time, time for my favorite scene of this 2 hour movie, the beginning and the ending are both super close to also being my favorite, but this one tops them all. Cecilia meets up with her sister in a public restaurant. The waiter was very funny and I enjoyed his performance even though we just get glimpses of his face. However, Cecilia goes on this monologue to her sister talking about how much she loves her, how she'd beat up James if she wanted to, and how Cecilia feels age when that strength is with her and scared when it's against her. She handles this very well and then starts talking about how she's found something, how she found a suit that can turn invisible, but then the sister looks over her shoulder, and we see a knife hovering there, and in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it shot, the knife slashes the sister's throat, and Adrian puts it into Cecilia's hand, and heads out. It's horrifying, it's the thing that sacred me most in my first viewing, and yeah, I know it should've been caught on tape, but I don't care. It's handled terrifically and it's a nice Segway into when Cecilia gets taken to a holding facility.
In this part she finds out she's pregnant, how Adrian's brother is working with him, and then there's an escape scene after Cecilia gets the better of Adrian and damages the suit. So now she's chasing him because he's going to punish her for this by killing Sydney, and Cecilia tells James the news. Then the Invisible Man shows up at the house way before Cecilia. In my second viewing I felt like Tom was closer and he put on a suit and after Adrian contacted him, he went to kill Sydney. That's the only reason for me to Redon how he got there so much earlier than Cecilia. Anyways, in a brutal scene Tom beats the daylights out of James before Cecilia pumps his guts full of lead! (Home Alone) She takes off the mask and it's Tom, Adrian's brother, I already explained how this might've happened above but yeah. Finale time!
In this finale Cecilia goes to Adrian's house for a date, because they made it look like Tom kidnapped Adrian and did all this stuff to Cecilia. So Adrian greets her and lets her in, they sit down, then Cecilia says, ""If you want to be a part of this child's life, then we have to start with honesty."" She tries to get him to admit that he was the Invisible Man but he won't budge. ""... that shouldn't come as a, Surprise."" After that line she knows, he did this to me 100%. So she excuses herself saying to need to tidy herself up and it cuts to Adrian alone when suddenly he starts shaking and his hand holding a knife come up to his neck and spits his own throat. Cecilia comes in and starts screaming at the sight that just happened she's all frantic and calls 911, notes the security camera visual line, backs up out of it, and ends the call. She did it, she killed Adrian, and because James was listening in through this the whole time he rushed down and knows Cecilia killed him but, ""It sounded like he killed himself."" So Cecilia got away with it, she walks up the steps, music swelling, and Leigh Whannel.
I may not have really given my opinion in the spoiler thing, but if you're any more of it, it's in my earlier review for The Invisible Man, anyways, that's pretty much it."
281,Great actors. Great story line. Kept my attention the whole time. Sometimes it felt like I was going crazy with the main character.. lol Watch it!
282,"The first half of the film is solid. A thriller in its purest and I was thoroughly enjoying the ride through terror. A constant panic reminiscent of Panic Room.But the second half of the film is rushed. And misguided. While individual scenes or moments may be all right, it simply doesn't fit. None of it does. After a stellar start, all the plot holes and idiocy became too much to bear, and I wish I didn't have to bear it."
283,Most amazing film On have ever seen. I love Elizabeth's acting. Every aspect of the film was perfect. Thanks director for that movie
284,"The camera angles and use of the empty space made me feel anxious and always looking for The Invisible Man. Really great performance from Moss which will of course be overlooked at awards season because it's a horror movie. The movie reminded me of Gone Girl but with more predictable turn of events. I didn't like the ending, I had a feeling that cop wouldn't do that. I really have to watch Upgrade now."
285,"""The Invisible Man"" is a sci-fi horror film loosely based on the novel of the same name by H.G. Wells. Written and directed by Leigh Whannell (Insidious Chapter 3, Upgrade) and starring Elisabeth Moss in the lead role, it is a slick, well-made adaptation that modernises a classic story for today's audiences without losing too much of its original appeal.In San Francisco, Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) lives with her abusive and manipulative boyfriend Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), who just so happens to be a renowned wealthy technological engineer. One night, Cecilia escapes from this relationship by drugging Adrian and fleeing into the woods where her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer) is waiting to pick her up. A couple of weeks later, Cecilia hears the news that Adrian has apparently committed suicide and left her a large sum of money in his will. Cecilia soon starts experiencing strange occurrences around her new living quarters from some kind of unseen force, leading her to believe that Adrian has faked his death and found an innovative way to continue tormenting her.Rather than present us with the typical horror/slasher genre, ""The Invisible Man"" instead treats its audience to scares relying on paranoia and the haunting feeling of personal trauma. Anyone who has escaped a relationship with a manipulative significant other should find plenty to identify with in what Cecilia experiences from time to time. Seeing the way she senses Adrian's presence when he is not physically visible gives us the feeling that he is always there watching over her, allowing us to properly understand her mental anguish and the psychological pain she has endured. This is where I feel it stands out a great deal over many of today's horror films thanks to its clever underlying commentary on abusive relationships. In spite of this, there are one or two jumpscares at certain points but for the most part they felt earned and not merely shoehorned in for the sake of a cheap fright. It pleases me that the filmmakers have taken this approach in adapting a classic story in such a manner instead of taking the easy route of making its invisible man go crazy and try to kill everyone just so we can have an overblown action climax, which is what happened in 2000's ""Hollow Man"".After writing and directing the underrated 2018 action thriller ""Upgrade"", Leigh Whannell returns with another film featuring the advancement of technology in ways we may not approve of. In addition to being about the aforementioned domestic abuse, the film also showcases how technological innovations can play a prominent part in our daily lives. We see how we must be careful to ensure that such electronics do not fall into the wrong hands as even devices with the best intentions can always be twisted and perverted into something evil. Whannell uses this stylistic approach wherever he can, heavily featuring scenes with hidden security cameras, mobile phones, and even something as simple as emailing to show how all of these things we take for granted have taken its toll on poor Cecilia throughout the story. Since the original novel was published in 1897, there obviously would not have been references to any of these electrical marvels in that era but thanks to inventive creativity of Whannell's writing, he manages to implement them into this film surprisingly well.Elisabeth Moss gives one of her most intense dramatic performances to date, which truly shows her range as an actress. There isn't a single moment where I wasn't convinced she was wrought with trauma over the abuse she has tolerated for so long from her boyfriend. Oliver Jackson-Cohen was also great in the title role, despite spending most of the film not visible to the naked eye and saying very little. Interestingly, most of his character's backstory is shown either through implied events or brief expository dialogue, yet remarkably all of it works. Again, this may be due to Leigh Whannell's clever writing and direction that gets everything important across to the audience without dragging down the story's overall entertainment value.In conclusion, even though I have not read the original novel in full, I can't help but feel that if he were alive today, H. G. Wells would likely be pleased with this adaptation. Wells was always fascinated yet cautionary with what technological achievements mankind will accomplish in the future, reflecting strongly in the novels he wrote. Because of this, I believe that if he were to see how a filmmaker who shares a similar mindset handles one of his stories for the big screen, he would be content that his warnings have been heeded in some way. However, what a modern audience will choose to make of these warnings, only time will tell.I rate it 8/10"
286,I admire the woman who killed the man in the end? What I don't understand a bit is what's the role of the male main brother. . . Reject domestic violence
287,"The invisible man 2020 is a good Scifi horror movie, it has tension, psychological horror, and a standout performance from Elizabeth Moss, that makes you really want to root for her character throughout the runtime of the movie. It tells the story of Elizabeth Moss's character escaping from the clutches of her abusive boyfriend, and two weeks later finding out that her boyfriend had commited suicide, but later on she finds out that she is being stalked and harrased by someone that she cannot see. Leigh Whanell has really put his stamp on this project. This movie builds tension, and actual scary thoughts and scenarios, executed greatly and effectively by Leigh Whanell and his crew.PROS:
-Amazing cinematography
-Stand-out performance from Elizabeth Moss
-Plot twist makes the story a lot more interesting
-Has that sense of uncertainty of is the Invisible Man there or not, and if Elizabeth Moss's character has gone insane or not
-A modern take on the old Universal monster Invisible ManCONS: Minor spoilers ahead
-Some plot inconveniences like how is the invisible man able to catch up to the heroine so quickly, another example would be at the ending like she killed him with a knife right, but then she appears without the suit right after immediately, like I'm pretty sure putting on and removing the suit takes a little bit more time than that, and then when she moans his death, the police officer rushes over, and he sees her all packed up and ready to go, come on how fast does she move? The speed of light like bro come on
-Some parts of the movie are a little bit stretched out and kinda boring, I had to pause for a bit and do something then come back and finish the movie for a better experience, which I don't normallydo, what I normally do is I watch the movie from start to finish continuously, but just when it's starting to get boring the twist comes in and brings me right back on board with the movie.Overall The Invisible Man is a good horror Sci-fi flick, that has excellent built up tension, amazing cinematography, a strong female lead in Elizabeth Moss, and a pretty interesting twist to round it all off. I give Invisible Man a 7/10, I did not enjoy it as much, found some parts boring, but it's still really good, and I would recommend this movie to people who are looking for a modern take on a horror classic, or people who are looking for good underrated films that will probably fly under the radar, Leigh Whannell is now on my directors to watch list."
288,"Not only is it a good remake, I'd say it's the best Universal Monster movie since Creature from the Black Lagoon! This remake is very different from the original 1933 film as well as the HG Wells novella it was loosely based on so purists may still be unhappy with this movie, but I'm all for updates to the classics (that's pretty much what the original films were, they're almost nothing like the original books) so it didn't bother me at all. The Invisible Man updates the story in very clever ways that I won't spoil here and it gives a sci-fi horror twist to a relevant story about an abusive relationship. Nobody sees it happening and nobody believes the main character when she tells people about it. Huh. The lead performance from Elisabeth Moss (yes, I'm spelling her name correctly this time) is fantastic, and this movie is SCARY! The original 1933 film was very effects-heavy with a lot of comedy. In this, there is no comedy to be found and the effects are very minimal, but even if the movie is showing you nothing it makes you feel the presence of an evil figure lurking around using only framing, sound design and Elisabeth Moss' performance. There are tons of tense and creative sequences (very similar to the director's last film, Upgrade) and a ton of suspense. You never know when the titular character is going to show up next and it keeps you on the edge of your seat! I think the movie was a little too fast-paced, the buildup to what's really going on could've been slower and more effective, and the score can be loud and overbearing at times, but overall I thought this movie was excellent. This is a must-see for any horror fan or fan of the classics! I'm so happy this movie is a hit and we'll be getting more movies like it! I can't wait, this is going to be awesome. The Universal Monsters are back and I couldn't be more happy. The director of this wants to do a remake of Dracula and James Wan is producing a Frankenstein remake, among a ton of other projects in development. Yes. All the yes. Give them to me. I want them."
289,Lost interest really early and couldn't get past the agenda. Hollywood is pushing so much this and that out that I have a hard time enjoying anything today(even kids movies are not safe from it)
290,"When it comes to Thriller, and not the Michael Jackson song mind you, these films can hold a wide range of quality from boring and lame, to the most engaging film of the year. As such, I could not help but hold skepticism when I saw the massive amounts of advertising for tonight's film. A film about the infamous monster movie, this Dark Universe turned stand-alone film looked to have potential, especially given the lead actress. Yet, Blumhouse studio's last film did not quite succeed like it wanted and once again returned to the theater to see if this film has the pizazz the hype is being granted.

An Angle That Does Not Make Sense
SUMMARY:The movie is taking a monster movie concept and bending the tale to become a much more dramatic thriller. Like a great mini-series, Invisible Man manages to take the movie magic of the original tale and add a little more realism to it to help group more people in. And it is that realism that makes so much of the rest of my likes really pop out for this movie. A major selling point of the film is the suspense, and boy does it deliver on this aspect through the use of so many thing. Whannell and her crew create a very tense atmosphere from the start of the movie to the end, never letting up on trying to keep you at the edge of the seat. My friend and I agreed the pace was great, a constant moving ride of one woman contesting her sanity with the supposed reality, and never stopping in its quest to keep you engaged. Very good camerawork helps amplify the feelings of a stalker in the midst and fighting the feeling of being alone despite the safety of the light. Using other creative tactics such as varying environments, the illusion of safety, and other coy maneuvers to bring the manipulation of the invisible man to full light. Throw in the use of fantastic sound editing, or in this case absence of sound editing and you fully get caught up in the atmosphere of fighting the paranoia and chaos of the real world. Once the Climax hits, the movie only further amplifies all these maneuvers, yet moves the tale to several new acts that keeps the story entertaining and interesting, yet rounding the tale to completion. And through it all, the main character is surprisingly amazing to latch on to, the emotional investment granting you empathy and rooting for her to find a break in the case. Much of this has to do with the acting of the cast, Moss once again unleashing her amazing potential in this character. She has these roles down pat, from the borderline sanity and screaming, to the strong woman ready to take charge. The character design, alongside her performance succeeds in making a strong, central pillar to which much of the movie weighs on. The rest of the crew does their job right of course, but I need to move on to the dislikes.My friend and I both agreed that the movie's simplistic backstory is a little disappointing, especially in terms of the secondary characters. While it was certainly for time purposes, I believe some extra time to background build up only would have further strengthened the character and helped get the rest of the cast involved more thoroughly in the film. Past this point though, the movie's component that is a minor flaw is the fake looking effects that sometimes arise. Understanding, it is not the main theme, the movie does sometimes draw into the fake looking special effects, that still fit for the film, but not the smoothest at times. Past that minor flaw, the movie's next component that got me was the predictability of the film. Now for me, I've had plenty of experience to see foreshadowing and allusion to what is coming next, so using that and much of what the trailers have revealed I got most of the twists of this movie. My friend though stated not remembering most of the trailers and did not pick up on some of the predictable parts, and stated that if you have not been bombarded by the trailers you should have no problem dodging much of the predictability. As for me though, I had most of the suspenseful moments toned down because I had a good guess of what was coming next. Yet, the part that got me near the end though was a concept the movie takes to geniously start the next bout of thrills and get the excitement turned up. Yet, that concept should have been consistent and if you review the scenes and realize Cecelia's advantage should have remained said advantage, but then gets warped in a nonsensical way was a little irritating for me. Lost in the moment and seeing the next approach to threatening, it helps soften the blow, but the logic does not have to drop for the sake of keeping the thrills.The VERDICT:
In all honesty, the movie was awesome on so many levels. An engaging character leads this thrilling, fast paced adventure, where a realistic approach helps to give this monster flick a much deserved repaint. Using fantastic camera and sound editing, alongside creative approaches to keeping the thrills coming only further amplifies this film's successful goal of entertaining, with plenty of rewatchability for this reviewer. And throw in the amazing character and acting to bring her to life and you will find the movie succeed on many levels to bring life into this genre. However, the lack of backstory is something I really longed for to help give more layers to a few of the characters, and the computer graphics to help show the threat could have sued some touching up. Alongside the predictability and inconsistent advantage twist, these two components were the weakest aspect of the movie, and for once I would have loved some extra time to iron things out and make it perfect. Overall though, this movie is a fantastic flick with rewatchability and definitely worth a trip to the theater with a group or by yourself.My scores for the film are:Horror/Mystery/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 8.5
Movie Overall: 7.5"
291,"With a constant pace, it makes its way to the tunnels of the unknown. Leigh Whannell creates an amazing work worthy of the genre and highlights its characteristics lost for too long. Genre film that will make people talk over the years and become a classic like its predecessors. Elizabeth Moss is simply talented, disturbing, precise and meticulous in the representation of her character; among other things, accompained by a perfect and substantial soundtrack that never misses the opportunity to highlight every gesture and every perfect shot. Exemplary direction, limpid, simple and perfect, which plays a lot on psychology, on the very concept on which the story itself is based. Milestone of the genre that fits well in this wall of mystery cinema."
292,The classic old story gets an upscale reinvention in The Invisible Man while also shedding light into the social menace of sadistic men who manipulate the women who love them through physical and mental abuse with the plot focusing more on the psychological effects of such a relationship where Elisabeth Moss acts like she's living the character and single-handedly shoulders the film into a solid entertainer with some great CGI-induced mind-blowing action sequences as well as a haunting score that overall enhances the appeal of the film as you self-quarantine yourself in these trying times. TN.
293,"Just watched this on its release in New Zealand.
I was hoping for a little distraction during a busy week. Instead I watched an edge-of-your-seat intense thriller.
Yep, plenty of suspense. Plenty of LOUD music at the right times to make the suspense more thrilling.
Not a good movie to relax too.Also, don't go expecting any sci-fi. There's no tech about how the guy develops the invisibility and there's no intrigue as to what cool stuff he can do once invisible.It's the story of an abused wife who escapes the husband who then uses invisibility to hunt her down and torment her.If you enjoy thrillers you'll enjoy this. Somewhat reminiscent of Double Jeopardy..."
294,"Such an amazing film with so many unexpected twists and turns, absolutely amazing acting I can't wait to wait to watch it again !!!! üôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèº"
295,"This film is a slow burn at first making it seem like ceci is going crazy with hallucinations and make the viewer doubt there is an 'invisible man' and only her own neurosies at work, gradually a more intriguing and deeper truth is uncovered 'litteraly' the tangled web of deciet of her ' husband ' has thrills and spills, the build up from the slow start takes on a faster pace as the invisible man takes a more direct approach to his prey and leaves nothing untouched on his path of destruction, including the previous subtlety. the ending is kind of predictable but is a good pay off, possibly leading to a sequel. some science fiction fans might not like the lack of explanation of how the invisible man became invisible, and instead opts for a cat n mouse thriller.Sure there are some plot holes, like how ceci seems to have a lack of common sense or the suspension of disbelief of how the 'invisible man' got to her so often through some what secure places."
296,This movie has bigger plotholes then Adriana Chechik's butthole.
297,"This is a terrible movie. Its whole conceit depends upon the audience believing everything our 'protagonist' tells us about her ex partner, despite not being shown anything to evidence it.
She claims she was abused, downtrodden, controlled and exploited, but what do we really see about this in the film to support it? Aside from the opening scene 'chase' there is nothing to connect the boyfriend to any harmful act. Indeed, even after his death her provides a large sum of money to the female lead, ensuring she is taken care of.
At no point do we see the ex-boyfriend in the suit. We have a drug addled scene in the psychiatric ward where the word 'surprise' and 'bang' are heard but these could be hallucinations brought on by stress and Medication.
The female lead is shown to be irrational and prone to bounds of serious emotional imbalance. She acts wrecklessly: drugging someone, setting fire to things, stealing cars.
We see that one single email is enough to have her own SISTER drop her like a hot potato. No questions are asked, the sister just outright tells her to go away and never see her again. This is not what happens to people with a history of normal behaviour.
And as for the ending! We have a police officer complicit in a murder of a man and he allows female lead to get away with it. He HEARS the man's gargled death cry - and we know she is wearing the wire so must be in the room at the time. All in all this film is bad."
298,"I can't even call this a movie unfortunately. Really , really boring... I can't believe Elisabeth Moss accepted this role...üòñ I'm glad i watched it for free. Please dont have any expectations if you watch it."
299,"Anyone who is saying this film is underrated is obviously not a fan of thrillers. I found the entire film very compelling and full of suspense, with fantastic visuals and an excellent soundtrack. Also the performances, in particular Elizabeth Moss, were solid throughout. It's definitely worth a watch especially for fans of this genre and anyone who loved Sleeping with the Enemy or Basic Instinct. The suspense throughout the film is intense, often times putting you at the edge of your seat and the ending is quite satisfying."
300,"Although there are no scary pictures in this movie, the atmosphere is very frightening. The heroine's counterattack looks particularly exciting. I love the ending."
301,"I've not much to say about this movie as it's not worth being popular: the plot is predictable. But the worst is it is not giving you any thrill, I don't know how this can be described as horror or a thriller. Not even a mystery as I mentioned that the plot is cheap. But on top of all that, the CGI so crappy that it looks like some Peter Gabriel's video from early 90's and so I can't imagine giving any more than 5 stars, but I doubt that even that is too much. And watching this on a cinema - come on, I can't recommend it even watching it at home."
302,"While I understand that every person is different and reacts differently to different situations, the scared-as-a-mouse performance by Elizabeth Moss upon leaving the relationship, to me, was just not believable. It takes A LOT to leave a relationship which has become as abusive and controlling as the one that was alluded to in this film. By the time one is emotionally ready to walk out, generally, you've been through all the pain, the doubts ... the weakness; by the time one has been driven to stand up and leave, generally, there is nothing as frightening ""out there"" as staying IN the relationship would be, and there is NOTHING more empowering than the moment you step out of that door KNOWING that it is the last time you will ever allow yourself to go back. Now, again, I understand, and would like the reader to understand, that this is just my opinion. For others it may be different and very well may be as was depicted in the film, where the recovery process takes a while longer and during that time the survivor still feels emotionally or physically vulnerable and at risk. Either way, people (I won't define by gender because there are men who are abused too) who find their legs and leave a situation such as this, sooner or later do discover that they are indeed among the strongest on earth.That being said, what I did like about the film is that none of the prior abuse was actually covered or depicted. If people are really thinking about the subject matter, it opens you up to the thought that in many of these real-life situations, the abusee is sometimes doubted, seen as not entirely credible, or are downright disbelieved by others. This film brought that home by picking an ""abuser"" who looked like a nice, average-looking guy, with an obviously good job, who looked like he could ""never do anything like that"". That was brilliant.The special effects were nicely done as well.Going back and forth between what I liked and did not like (ergo my title of Mixed Feelings), contrary to what I see is a popular opinion, I do not think this ties in well with the ""Invisible Man"" franchise. If the creators were not actively saying it is, I would have figured it was a script about a tech-genius who discovers how to make himself 'not seen', and NOT about THE ""Invisible Man"" we've read about and have seen in the past.There were also plot holes galore which I took the time to list, but then thought better of it so that even though this is tagged with a spoiler warning, if you have not seen the film it won't spoil it too much for you.While I have some problems with the film, I still suggest you watch it. It is entertaining enough, suspenseful in some places, and most of the acting and special effects are pretty great.6.5/10"
303,"At least twice in this movie, one of the characters has the opportunity to pick up a gun and use it to kill the killer, yet for some mysterious reason, they choose not to... that's extremely unrealistic and also a plot hole as far as I'm concerned. It's honestly the only real reason that stops me from rating this an 8.5/10.The other issue is jump-scares... there's one part in the movie in particular where a VERY loud and obvious 'violin screech' horror sound is played in order to make the viewer jump... it's an extremely cheap tactic and any horror movie worth its salt can do without cheap jump scares like that, so I'm deducting more points for that.Overall, the movie could have been better and even with the above issues, it still is a commendable 7/10. Elisabeth Moss delivers a very believable performance and she pretty much carries this entire movie from start to finish all on her own (the poor woman's back must be hurting something fierce!)."
304,Don't waste ur life... watching this movie! The positive comments about this movie are fake. 0 Rating
305,"""The Invisible Man"" creeps into 2020 with a pervasive sense of dread, terrific acting and cinematography, and a plot that both honours the source material while delivering a powerful allegory of abuse in relationships and the #MeToo movement."
306,"There's this rule in writing called ""show, don't tell"". This movie has an awful lot of telling. The dialogue hurt me and the characters were flat. One of the worst movies I have seen in a while. How the rating of this movie is at 7.2 is beyond me."
307,Wow. What a movie. This movie has truly kept the psychological thriller genre alive and the best of all movie genres. Best movie I've seen in a long time. Hands down.
308,"Don't waste your time. Boring, predictable, bad editing, plot holes,just trash. How even possible to rate it more than 0???"
309,"This movie is SO BAD! All the positive reviews for this movie are FAKE. I'm so glad I didn't see this in theater, it's not even worth watching."
310,"Elisabeth Moss is such a great actor,she is totally versatile and has this very unique face.
Well paced,and well shot,gets a little silly in the last 20 mins will be happy most of all !!
Great entertainment and good ""R"" rated movie,part from the 3 second cut in shower."
311,"The movie was very good, in my opinion. A fun watch. Full of suspense, twists, great acting, and interesting surprises. I think Elizabeth Moss is extremely talented, and this was a great showpiece for her, demonstrating her strong ability to carry a movie pretty much on her own. The scary parts were scary, suspenseful, and the pay-offs were gory enough to be billed as horror.I could have used more cool invisibility effects, more creative methods for finding the invisible man, and less of the flashing stuff. The explanation of his invisibility was fine with me; any more, in my opinion, would have detracted from the main story line. The man's obsession was never fully developed or understood, and that bugged me more than under developing the invisibility stuff.This really had very little to do with the book, except for a few nods to the source material, but it stands on its own as a completely separate story with interesting, fleshed out characters. It was like elements of the Invisible Man mixed with Gaslight, an old play about a husband driving his wife crazy. Both are interesting, scary concepts and the ideas blended nicely."
312,"If you asked one hundred different people what they would do given the chance to be invisible and you may get one hundred different answers. I'm sure that nearly all of the answers would be self-serving, but few of them would be, ""I'd terrorize my ex-girlfriend.""""The Invisible Man"" was a big slice of the Julia Roberts starred ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" in which a woman sought to escape her abusive husband. ""The Invisible Man"" begins with Cecilia Kass (Elizabeth Moss) going through extreme lengths to escape from her sleeping boyfriend. It was readily apparent early on that she had a real fear of her boyfriend Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) and that escaping could only be done surreptitiously. Things only got worse instead of better for her two weeks later when her sister notified her that Adrian was dead.
Cecilia was dealing with a grade one psycho. He made her life a living hell and he did it slowly, calculatedly, and invisibly. If Cecilia was going to be able to shake her ex once and for all she would have to somehow prove he was still alive.
Moss was excellent as the haggard girlfriend. There was barely a scene except she looked distraught, disheveled, and defeated. It was apparent that Adrian was uniquely adept at making her miserable. The more he antagonized her the more you wanted her to triumph, but could she keep it together?"
313,"Director: Leigh Whannell
Cast: Elisabeth Moss, Aldis Hodge, Storm Reid, Harriet Dyer, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Michael Dorman
Screenplay: Leigh Whannell, based on the novel by H.G. Wells
Cinematography: Stefan Duscio
Music: Benjamin WallfischThe Invisible Man is a modern take on H.G. Wells' 1897 novel. Its main themes are very timely today speaking to the need to believe the testimonies of victims and a cautionary tale on a slow steady descent towards becomming trapped in a controlling abusive relationship. Strong performances lead by Moss and a memorable supporting turn by Aldis Hodge as Detective James Lanier plus nimble camera work from Stefan Duscio and Benjamin Wallfisch's driving score make it a tense thriller that's definitely worth the watch.P.S. watch for an Easter egg tip to the original. ; ) 7/10"
314,"SPOILERS
She does bag things, and his brother does bad things, but Adrian?No evidence of him being any kind of villain whatsoever.They did nothing to establish him as a bad guy. and there is zero evidence of him every having been in the suit at any point in the movie.Obviously they didn't want to do anything as troublesome as establish his villain bona fides, so you are just supposed to accept that he's done all the things she and his brother claim.The movie opens with her having drugged him, and her ""escaping"" from their home.He wakes, he chases her and he punches through the car window and tries to pull her out. Is that evidence that he's a monster, or just that he's mad as hell that she drugged him?And that's it. Nothing more.Adrian smashes a car window and tries to grab her.Everything else is done by his brother... oh, except for when she puts on the spare suit and makes it look like Adrian killed himself.Hodge's character lets her go, not because he is on her side, but because he is scared of crossing a known murder who has a stealth suit. He has a daughter to consider, after all."
315,"Very entertaining and suspenseful. Sometime in the near future, there will be a invisible suite. Overwhelming science fiction movies I viewed in the 60's and 70's, became science fact. But no floating brain yet."
316,Lol..Saying anything won't do anything. Just watch.
317,"Another Invisible Man movie from the original source of the classic book and played by Claude Raines to Chevy Chase. I wasn't expecting much but it gripped me from the first scene. Without giving anything away (SO NO SPOILERS HERE) it is obvious that the focus, pun not intended, is from a woman in a terrible marriage. From that point the scifi element is almost, obviously not completely, pushed aside and it becomes a psychological horror thriller of a woman who may be brinking on insanity from two points of view really. One being characters attitude to her and the other you doubting whether she can mentally cope with her situation and obstacles.
There is not a huge cast in this plot so the actors all have big roles to play and they do so brilliantly in the demands a screenplay requires. As for directorship and cinematography it is all done very well.I honestly can't praise this film enough so giving it a huge 8/10. It is almost grueling than enjoyable and heightens towards a enthralling climax. The script takes the original source, rips it up and throws it out the window and creates a psychological horror/thriller. Or thriller/horror. Undecided on which is more dominant as my head is still spinning from viewing. Most recommended viewing, this time pun intended!"
318,"Although it is a good story, this is a movie that could've had a ton of potential to be much better than it was. Though I did enjoy it and was a good watch, I think this movie would've been a major improvement had they brought in much better actors/actresses (Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the lead would've been my pick; Elizabeth Moss is an amazing actress but she didn't really mesh well with the other actors/actresses), added more premise and story to the characters as we don't know too much as to her relationship with her ex-husband, or why she moved in with her friend who happens to be employed within the Law Enforcement field.Overall the big problem was this movie was moved too quickly, if they added more premise, answers, and detail I think it'd be deemed as one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever."
319,"Total waste of time... apparently my review is too short, and the movie was too long."
320,I don't know how this film has 7+ rating. One of the worst films I've seen recently.
321,"The plot is absolute predictable. Too many things are to obvious and too many things don't make sense. Characters are delaying their next move or action is being delayed in a way, that as a tool to create suspense its use is so obvious that it makes me cringe watching it. The whole film is sloppy writing and directing."
322,"Ther were some good moments in the movie but it overall lacked the mystery factor, the pace is good, story is average, and predictability is 100%. Overall it will hold your attention if you are new to thriller genre but nothing special to garner praise."
323,"It gets a little silly towards the end, but it does end on a really effective and cathartic note that, quite frankly, we need in this day and age. There's one scene mid way through that made me gasp so loud that my cat leapt up and ran out of the room. Moss is wonderful in the film as well and supports the entire thing on her shoulders."
324,"The Invisible Man was a novel written in 1897 by H.G. Wells (who wrote The Time Machine and War of the Worlds). Since the novel has been written, many films and shows have been created but the most recent one is the 2020 film, The Invisible Man. The Invisible Man was released in early 2020 (around the time of the global pandemic). The Invisible Man was a box office and critical hit. The Invisible Man notably stars Elisabeth Moss but the rest of the cast (to me at least) is largely unknown. The film was directed by Leigh Whannell and was produced by Jason Blum. Yes, this is a standalone film and not apart of this Universal's Dark Universe which will never happen thanks to 2017's The Mummy. Also do keep in mind that this film is a modern interpretation (much like 2005's War of the Worlds).The film follows Cecilia (played by Elisabeth Moss) who is in a bad relationship with this guy named Adrian. She leaves him one night and barely escapes. Adrian is a smart guy and works with optics and stuff and supposedly kills himself after Cecilia left him. Cecilia feels that she can be happy now that Adrian is gone but that might not be the case.I had a really good feeling about this film when the trailer came out. The film looked scary enough and when it came time to watch this film, I was blown away. First of all, the acting is absolutely amazing. Elisabeth Moss gives an amazing performance. It was a very believeable performance. Her appearance and everything works with what the film is trying to portray. You want someone who looks insanse? You got it! The other performances are really good to. There is this one waiter dude who was really entertaining to watch even though he had one tiny scene in the film! The horror in this film is just amazing. This film uses suspense very effectively and can make scenes truly creepy and scary. There will be scenes where nothing happens but the setup makes it seem that way and it just builds on to the suspense and the cinematography is great here. The scary part is the horror that we cannot see. Which is what H.G. Wells had in mind when writing the source material. With that being said, the Invisible Man himself is truly frightening. A minor complait here though is that it is obviously CGI. It is not bad but very noticeable. The whole setup for this film works very well. We have a woman who is treated like she is crazy and everything just goes downhill in her life to the point where her life is on the edge of being completely ruined. It is a very believeable setup and everything here makes sense and is pretty straightforward. Even to the Invisible Man. What we learn about him, makes absolute sense. When the ending came around, I was not too sure about whether I like it or not. But, I have since decided that I like it because it just works. Plus it somewhat makes sense because of another film to be released as well.The Invisible Man 2020 is possibly the best film of 2020. It is also one of my new favorite horror films of all time. It is scary, suspensful, and just wonderfully acted."
325,"Interesting take on the Invisible Man concept. I disagree with some reviews regarding the directing, and acting from Elizabeth Moss, which I thought were very good. However, I am echoing other reviewers regarding the lapses in logic and plot holes once you start thinking about it. So nothing groundbreaking here but if you just take it for what it is, it's entertaining and thrilling enough to have a good time."
326,"This is a very excellent film. Brilliantly created in all written and film media. Leigh Whannell created all three and accompanied the film with a remarkable and handsdown bloody terrific score. I haven't watched such a superb and scary film in yonks.
But, in due deference to the grumpy reviewers, the latter third of the movie left the sphere of realism somewhat. But despite those glitches this movie by Whannell rises to a definite 8 stars by this viewer who hasn't felt chills like that since The Wax Museum, a horror film I saw when I was a kid! My bad memory! Sorry ( !!!) for film buffs the 1953 film with Vincent Price was The House of Wax by Andre de Toth.
Almost sent me to seek psychiatric help at the young age of 6 years. My brother who lied and told my mother the proposed movie that Saturday in The Killester Cinema was to be a cowboy opera. Oh the horror! The humanity!!!!"
327,"After watching this film, my heart was also reacted to the villains"
328,"This is a horror that is actually more realistic and relatable than others. Of course no one has the technology now yet to turn someone invisible, but that's not the point. What makes this story good is bringing out a realistic horror to the premise. Just think of any abuser that you've had and gotten away from, what if they had the ability to be unseen and they stalked you? What if you have this feeling that you can never get away from their abuse no matter how far you run or where you hide.
Of course the movie has some logic issues of traveling or using video cameras for evidence. But the performances are good and having the horror antagonist be a regular person just makes the story scarier since it makes it feel more real, taking aside the ability to turn invisible."
329,"I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend to anyone that likes a bit of a suspense/thriller. It was a little long, but I was certainly never bored. If you enjoyed something like Get Out then you would certainly enjoy this movie."
330,"Mildly entertaining, but ultimately disappointing. Laborious and numerous closeups of Moss's face, and an extremely slow lead up to what felt like a pretty contrived ending. It had no business being longer than 90 minutes. I like Moss, her scared/confused faces are the best, but this was a poor vehicle for her talents. Yawn."
331,"When you drop your medication and your abusive boyfriend picks it up. When you stop several times on your escape. When you wave your flashlight around everywhere when your life is one the line. When you get a fortune and the next scene you are haunted by your invisible ""dead"" boyfriend. I wish we could have great horror films under the Universal Studios banner again."
332,"I honestly thought it was a decent movie if you take it as it is and acknowledge that the actors, especially Elizabeth Moss, did a really good job playing their parts and making it believable and that the jump scare scenes were pretty decent as far as I'm concerned and I consider myself a fair horror movie buff.However you can't really ignore the many plot holes.The one I struggled with the most during this movie was that at no point anyone considered using a thermal camera, she's friends with a cop for gods sake and never once considers that he might be able to obtain something like that for her.. but a thermal camera may have been too easy of a resolution which doesn't exactly make for a good movie.And the scene where everyone's racing to stop the husband from killing Sydney, somehow there is no phone in the house that could reach her, nor does a COP have numbers of any of their neighbours to try and reach, which in 2019/2020 you would think at least one of those options is available. It is somewhat believable that some circumstances are working against them such as no house phone, phones being dead, or even that no one is answering, yet they chose to just ignore including any of that and I guess leave it up to the viewers imagination..Any other plot hole that I noticed has already been included in other reviews so I won't bore anyone by going over it again, but I couldn't rest until I pointed out the above.Regardless of the plot holes though my stance remains that this wasn't a terrible movie, and if you can get past the logical plot holes then I recommend watching it anyways because you may still really enjoy it."
333,"This movie is a waste of time and money . Very disappointed ,compare to ""Hollow Man"" it's way beyond that. Very weak story and the play of the actors is very down the hill . I put 2 stars for the dog"
334,So many holes you could sieve water through it. Predictable at every turn as once again it appears we need everything telegraphed so we will get it. Final thought? At least Chevy Chase's adaptation was intentionally comedic.
335,"Elizabeth Moss must account for a chunk of the budget.
She justifies it by having a fight with herself on the kitchen floor and showing the audience where to look.
The cinematic equivalent of a mediocre tribute band."
336,"When she was possibly going to be locked up in a cell for extended periods of time, what was his plan for eating, drinking & using the toilet, if he was going to remain in the prison to taunt her.In the Prison canteen ""guys look over there, that meal tray is floating across the room"".Being invisible doesn't really help you in a secure institution with locked doors. What rubbish."
337,"This version of The Invisible Man tale uses the hook of a controlled/abused spouse escaping their partner, who in turn is able to torment them whilst invisible. This adds a unique twist to the interpretation of this classic and is one of its strongest points.The updated story-line has garnered quite a bit of praise for The Invisible Man, but unfortunately _just_ hitting the correct topic buttons in the year of a film's release does not necessarily a good movie make.There are problems, but they are more to do with the execution. Quite often things are not explained when they need to be. For example, we get the impression that once Cecilia (played by Elisabeth Moss) escapes her abusive spouse, she stays with a friend of her sister, but we're not really given any details. It just ends up feeling as though she's staying with a random stranger who has inexplicably accepted her into his house and home along with his teenage daughter. Perhaps there's a throwaway line that explains it more clearly but, if so, it's easy to miss, as I've seen the same complaint from others.Then there are logic problems... The examples below are far from being the only ones, but they are of the most obvious.1 - At one point we see the invisible man's breath, whilst outside in the cold. It makes for an unsettling and effective moment. However, when we discover _how_ he is maintaining his invisibility, we realise this should not be possible. He is fully covered, head-to-toe, in such a way as to imply his breath should not escape in this way. You could just about excuse this for dramatic effect, but let's move on...2 - There's an incident where Cecilia tips paint on his head and shoulders. Within moments, the invisible man has run to the sink, washed himself, and is once again _completely_ invisible. Remember, whilst doing this he would not have been able to see himself, in order to see the areas he needed to wash off.3 - At one point, Cecilia gets hold of her 'dead' husband's phone, which contains photos of her sleeping. She clearly could not have taken these herself, and they prove the existence of a stalker which would in turn prove she is not imagining things. What does she do? She leaves it. She doesn't even send the photos to her own phone.4 - The invisible man appears to have been hiding out in the attic space. How does he get up and down without drawing attention? He certainly couldn't leave the ladder out, that Cecilia herself required to gain access.5 - During an excursion to her old home, she finds a second, spare invisibility suit, and then hides it at a time when she could have used it. Perhaps, you think, she did not know enough about the technology and how it works, or if it would even fit her, and therefore didn't take the risk. This is actually pretty logical. But then at the conclusion she does exactly this, in a situation of far less urgency. She also manages it very quickly.6 - And finally... During several scenes Cecilia has the upper hand, but conveniently pulls back or just outright waits to give her stalker whatever time he needs. There are quite a few of these moments (the paint spilling being one of them), but the most egregious is near the end, where the invisible man takes out a selection of useless security guards. Throughout this whole scene, Cecilia rests on the floor, watching, with a gun lying on the floor beside her. Only _after_ the last guard is defeated (bearing in mind that it has taken some time for the invisible man to work his way through all of them), does she pick it up and take a shot.One could excuse some of this behaviour by saying that it's part of her difficulty and fear at taking action against her abuser, but in these scenes she is shown as already having found the strength and will-power to fight back. She may be afraid, but there is no implication of _debilitating_ fear. Instead, she handily waits so that the action can unfold in the plot-required way, otherwise the story would finish too soon.Elisabeth Moss does well as Cecilia, although sometimes she feels a little one-note, though that could be down to the director and script. As for the rest of the cast, none of them really stand out, but that's not really a flaw. This is Cecilia's story, and the rest of the cast aren't really that important besides driving events where necessary.Visually it's well filmed, and builds tension effectively. Beyond that, it's a fairly average but enjoyable take on The Invisible Man story. Did I enjoy it? Yes, it wasn't a bad movie, but I certainly won't feel the need to re-watch it, and I don't feel it deserves the level of praise it gets. This is the 2020 equivalent of a fun little '80s straight-to-video thriller."
338,"Starts incredibly slowly, trying to build tension but just feels like it's dragging on. The best bit is when her sister is killed, and at this point you think the pace might change dramatically.... but sadly it doesn't really. It plods along with some laughable killing scenes and countless plot holes, with some serious over acting from Elizabeth Moss. I have no idea why this is categorised as a HorrorOverall .. a bit ""meh"""
339,I did not like this movie. It could have been way better.
340,"This movie largely succeeds, despite giving away its premise from the start, as both a nail-biting dramatic thriller and poignant social commentary on unhealthy relationship dynamics. Does it have plot holes? Yes. Do they spoil the movie to the extent some reviews are suggesting? Not unless you are uncommonly cynical and picky.This is not an HG Wells Invisible man. I've read the book, and this is not it.I was skeptical that a rather worn horror/thriller trope could yield fresh frights, and while I don't think the scares are all incredibly original, the film does what it sets out to do. It was infuriating to constantly know that a jump-scare was looming on the horizon, yet still feel jolted in that disconcerting way that makes jump-scares an enduring staple of the genre. I want to complain that the sparse soundtrack and tired inception ""booj"" effects were unfairly wielded or that the timid, slow-pan camera was applied too often, but honestly, it worked. I could have done with less predictability in the sound design, however. I was scared, despite myself. I was thrilled. And isn't that what thrillers are supposed to do? It kept me on the edge of the seat.Acting was solid, with the lead giving a praiseworthy performance of a harried, mentally unstable victim, whose mannerisms and appearance gradually deteriorate into convincing madness. Her character is believable in ways that Barbieesque horror girls often are not. She possesses an every-woman charisma reminiscent of the first Halloween movie, or Drew Barrymore's Scream opener, seems impossibly average, and the audience is both compelled to empathize and also dared to question her sanity, so that the plot manages to leave a few questions to be answered until the closer (and perhaps even after). It's not a cliffhanger or a I-didn't-see-that-coming movie, but it's still satisfying.If you like a good thriller, see it.
If you like a good psychological thriller, see it.
If you like fast-paced thrillers, maybe pass on this one.
If you nitpick plot holes, go suck on a lemon and frown at the mirror, or stretch your imagination and enjoy this simple, but entertaining, ride.It's worth the price of admission.(I made it all the way through with no ""invisible"" puns, and I'm quite proud of myself)"
341,"The unsettling violent crashing of the waves in the intro of 'The Invisible Man' sets the mood and tone for what's to follow. I knew from the beginning that at the very least, the soundtrack and score would keep me hooked throughout. I wasn't wrong.'The Invisible Man' begins with Cecilia creeping out of bed in the middle of the night, looking panicked and obviously desperate to form an escape. The intro to this film is shot sublimely, it kept me on edge and was a perfect starting point. If the rest of the film were able to maintain the same level of tension then we'd be looking at a horror classic right here. Things settle down after the introduction for a pretty considerable amount of time before Cecilia starts to notice strange occurrences.Cecila is smart, much smarter than most of the other characters deem her to be. She has great direction throughout the film, utilizes space properly and uses common sense to get out of danger. Which is very refreshing to see in any horror film these days.The main issue with this film are the plot holes and ultimately the lack of plot itself. There's not an awful lot of backstory to the events that transpired before the introduction of the movie. This causes a lack of emotional connection and empathy with the main characters. However, the unpredictable and tense nature of the film is enough to carry you through if you can forget about the plot. The 120-minute runtime doesn't do this film any favours and makes it feel a little drawn out at times too.Surprisingly, there's not an awful lot of jump scares throughout 'The Invisible Man'. There's one real shocking scene and a twist or two that occur but most audience members will be able to sense and predict these. Especially those that are switched on to the horror genre. I highly recommend watching this with earphones or headphones that have good bass and audio quality. Either this or with a home surround sound cinema system. The best feature and detail of this film is the soundtrack and score.Except for the soundtrack, Elisabeth Moss (Cecilia) is the star of the show here. She delivers an excellent performance which kept me hooked from the start and throughout. The other characters leave quite a lot to be desired.'The Invisible Man' provides a somewhat enjoyable viewing experience, just don't get expecting film of the year material. It's certainly one that you could watch when you have nothing else to do or anything else to watch. Will it blow your mind and leave you speechless? Not really, maybe just in a scene or two. However, it's definitely something that will keep you occupied for a good couple of hours."
342,"Unfortunately this movie doesn't tell you everything.. It missed a few key points. Was expecting a lot more, very disappointed."
343,Very well done. Creepy and cleverly plotted. The scenarios have so many possibilities and the way this film went about it was excellent. Adrian is truly a creepy character.
344,"Forget about all of the nonsense, negative reviewers and dimwit trolls leaving One-Star comments.
The Invisible Man is an excellent movie.
And innovative director, Leigh Whannell, (who directed the superb Upgrade (2018), gives us a fresh take on the whole
psycho-horror drama. Elizabeth Moss is an acting tour-de-force. And I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
Considering that The Invisible Man was produced with a budget of just under $8 million, actually what Leigh Whannell
has managed to achieve here, is something short of a major miracle. Bloomhouse does it again.It's refreshing to watch a film, director and ensemble cast that, for once treats it's audiences as intelligent adults, and that
offers something very original and different from the usual Horror film fodder.As for the numptees talking about plot-holes. Well, show me one horror movie that been made in the last decade, that also
doesn't have huge plot-holes? The Invisible Man is much more than a remake. It's storyline tackles head on the psychological effects of domestic abuse, intimidation and bullying. And just how sociopaths and abusers can easily manipulate, exploit certain situations. And I also thought that the movie got all of the pacing right.
This was never ever going to be a 'jump scare' movie. It just offers us something else. Which is a good thing.And what really makes this movie sing is the strength and depth of Elizabeth Moss' performance.
Moss with every new roles just keeps on becoming an even more impressive actress.And for those of you that are 4K UHD Blu-ray movie collectors. The Invisible Man looks outstanding in the 4K format."
345,"Whoever gave this bad reviews wasn't watching the right movie, very entertaining movie and brilliantly acted"
346,I loved it. Not like other horror movies like Annabelle and such. Really cool movie
347,Excellent up to date view of the invisible man. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Elisabeth Moss is perfect in this role
348,Great movie. That is all. Captivating from beginning to end. I even fast forwarded through the end credits hoping there was more.
349,"Horror movies are my least favourite genre mainly because of cheap jumpscares and stupid characters & plots.This movie has so much style, amazing camera work. I saw the police & fainting scene and thought they were similar to Upgrade (one of my favourites from 2018). I later realised the director and cinematographer were the same duo for both films. Will be eyeing for more of their films.Elizabeth Moss shines in the role, she carried the whole film with her fantastic portrayal of scared and at the same time, strong feminine. She had some guts to escape and later getting into the same house.
Adrian felt charming and innocent, fantastic delievery of a psychopath. The other side characters were good at what they were given.Thank God I haven't watched the trailer, I stopped watching trailers for non-blockbuster films and wait for reviews or high word of mouth. The movie shocked me so many times.The movie kept me griping, a well crafted thriller indeed. There were some jump scares but they weren't cheap. I loved that the movie kept us with the protagonist and we were discovering with her, I even felt she was the one seeing all this ghost in her head and that was ganna be the last twist. Even with sci-fi elements this movie is highly grounded.The final twist was great, the other twist with sister were well earned shock value. Adrian died poetically just like he killed her sister.I rewatched some of the scenes, I discovered many things, like Adrian's phone wallpaper being hexagonal, invicible gun shaking just like in the end Adrian says. There were many respectful homage to the original version - hat, bandage. The movie sets up many key points in the background which comes into play later.For a few moments in the film, I felt it draged. There were playing with the same substance for too long. The 3rd act felt much quicker but first two acts were hella thrilling. 1st act did a great job of setting up the tone and characters.
Some of Cee's decisions fell into the horror cliche.I hear universal is planning on doing a sequel, The Invisible Woman. A lot of potential. Hope quality stays high with grounded realistic setting like this one."
350,Not quite as bad as I expected from something that was supposedly tailored to the woke crowd. It's not a great movie either but it definitely isn't without its moments. I'm glad I didn't dish out theater money for it but it was worth the rental cost at home.
351,"Overall I liked this movie. Got me sitting down for 2 hours. Many twists and SURPRISES.... They didn't choose the most beautiful girl to play this , she actually missed a tooth if I correctly observed it lol.As far as acting, music and curiosity it brought with it I really think they did a good job. But no horror, far from it, they did however do a great job to keep me guessing. I was amused and would love to see more like this. Simple quality without all the unnecessary fuzz movies in this genre bring with themselves!"
352,"All the actors in the film give great performances, especially Elisabeth Moss.The plot does not proceed fast, so you may get bored after a while.Not many surprises, as well."
353,"Mad scientist is also an abusive stalker. Starting when Cecelia gets away from the abusive stalker, she nonetheless continues to be impacted by the echoes of the emotional abuse. But these aren't echoes. Elizabeth Moss does well to turn the woman of domestic violence into one of psychological breakdown. She keeps the movie engaging. Whannell manages the direction of this film well (he also wrote the story and screenplay). He frames shots expertly to give empty space a personality. Worth the rental."
354,"It seems now more than ever, the film industry is turning to the literary world to find its stories. The big studios feel adaptations is where the money is. So, whenever I sit down to watch a translation of a beloved book to the big screen, I must admit, I'm always sceptical. It is essential to ask the questions; do we need this and do we need it now. For Australian Director Leigh Whannel's sci-fi-horror, The Invisible Man, that is a resounding yes and yes. This smart and timely film takes H.G. Wells classic of the same title and ultimately changes the main characters perspective. Instead of assuming the eye of an invisible man, we follow his victim, here Cecilia Kass (expertly played by Elizabeth Moss.)
The film opens with Cecilia's escape from her abusive boyfriend and optic tech giant Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen.) After news of his death a few weeks later it seems Cecilia can finally begin to rebuild her new life. However, an inexplicable and invisible presence begins to show itself to Cecilia who struggles to convince those around her of its existence.
We have seen Moss in this role before, I'm thinking of the breath-taking The Handmaid's Tale in particular, a strong yet vulnerable woman battling a dystopic patriarch with force and wit. And she certainly does the role justice here too. Let us not forget that for most of the film she is reacting and even fighting with something that isn't there. Convincing the audience of something that is not there is to the credit of Whannel's direction also. He's experience in the genre (with both the Saw and Insidious franchises under his belt) shows in tense moments of empty hallways and open frames. One of my favourite moments in the film sees Cecilia panting in the cold outside as checks to see if anyone mysteriously opened the front door. Just next to her, literally breathing down her neck, we see the cold breath of the invisible man. Stefano Duscio's photography and the design of the sound department help to sell these moments. The combination of slow measured pans across empty rooms with moments of silence interrupted by ear shattering synthetic booms received many jumps and gasps in the theatre.
But ultimately it is not the filmmaking that makes this film so worthy of your time. It is Whannel's choice to follow the woman instead of the man that makes this an important movie. It is not possible to separate The Invisible Man from the context of its time. The stories of #MeToo, men who after using their positions of power to abuse women are exposed by those same women, sound eerily familiar to the summary given of The Invisible Man. Despite the hybrid of a genre Whannel is working within, he is still able to maintain the seriousness this type of story deserves. It is for that reason I see The Invisible Man as a film adaptation that we need, and one that we need for a film industry of today."
355,"After seeing the trailer for this movie included on a previous rental, I couldn't wait untill it was released for rental with Redbox. I rented and watched it with my husband the day that it was released. He reluctantly agreed to watch it with me, as he figured it would end up being just some basic 'woman empowerment' movie. Let me tell you though, within the first 15 - 20 minutes of the movie, he put down his phone and became completely engrossed in the story!!
I'm not going to give anything away, but it captures your attention starting with the opening credits, keeping you on the edge of your seat for the majority of the film, all the way to the shocking ending. And Elizabeth Moss delivers a rollercoaster, and sympathetic, performance.
On a side note: if you've seen Hollow Man with Kevin Bacon, the overall unnerving sense you will feel while watching this movie, is what Hollow Man tried to create, but tragically failed!!"
356,"This movie was about 30 minutes too long and pretty much every twist was super predictable. That being said, if you're a fan of Elisabeth Moss which I am, then you will most likely enjoy it even at its 2 plus hour runtime. Moss has the ability to make this otherwise cookie cutter story watchable."
357,"There were many tense moments where I did the ol' stare at the corner of the screen trick to give my nerves a break.Other than that, the message was positive: justice and a taste of an abuser's own medicine.Other than that x2, the action was decent at parts. The heroine grappling and being thrown around by an invisible force looked cheesy on more than one occasion.The dinner scene with her sister though...that was crazy.Overall, this movie starts off with an incredible opening scene, slowly builds up the tension again, and unleashes it in a way that does get heavy-handed at times.The ending also felt a little unresolved and cobbled together.8.5/10. So a B+ just for taking a dumb premise and making it effective and entertaining."
358,"The director is really straightforward. He not only grasps the rhythm well, but also creates the atmosphere in place, and knows what the audience wants to see, even if the invisible person is not a new trick. It is not recommended to watch the trailer. Watching it will greatly reduce the fun of the movie watching process."
359,"The Invisible Man is a psycho thriller that imagines a new version of the famous horror film character. Written and directed by Australian genre specialist Leigh Whannell who has brought us genre masterpieces such as Saw and Insidious as well as the science-fiction highlight Upgrade, this movie tells us the story of a young architect named Cecilia who finally has the courage to run away from an abusive relationship with a wealthy optics engineer named Adrian. She drugs him, escapes his isolated mansion and is saved by her resilient sister Emily. Cecilia still feels highly unstable and expects her abusive ex-partner to track her down and hurt her. She moves in with a family friend called James who is a cop and his daughter Sydney. Things seem to get better when Cecilia learns that her former partner has committed suicide. His brother and lawyer Tom even announces her that she will receive a generous sum of money on a monthly basis as long as she remains mentally sane and doesn't commit a crime. Despite the good news, Cecilia is unable to turn the page. Items like her keys mysteriously disappear from her new home. She collapses during a job interview. Someone sends Emily a hateful message in her name. Cecilia starts to wonder whether her former partner isn't dead at all and has come back to destroy her life or whether she is just imagining these things and slowly going crazy.This movie convinces on numerous levels. The acting performances are truly credible and especially lead actress Elisabeth Moss convinces as an unstable woman who desperately tries to get her life back on track. The idea to combine a historic horror film character with a contemporary setting of domestic abuse is courageous, fresh and inspiring. The movie builds up anticipation, atmosphere and tension that lead to a spectacular final quarter.There are some elements that could be improved however. The film certainly overstays its welcome with a length cracking the two-hour mark. It also features some tired genre tropes such as extremely clumsy behaviour by the lead character in the opening sequence and the fact that nobody believes her incredible story. There are also very few scares for a horror movie as this film rather qualifies as a mixture of domestic violence drama and psychological thriller.If you are willing to see a legendary horror film character in a completely new setting involving domestic abuse, you are certainly going to appreciate The Invisible Man. This movie has the very positive message to fight domestic abuse by any means necessary, get every help available and bring the perpetrator to justice. In a certain way, this movie combines social drama and psychological thriller. If you simply want to watch a great horror movie however, then this movie can be described as tense at best but is very rarely truly scary."
360,"This was a fun and unique take on the invisible man. Elisabeth Moss was great (like always), it had plenty of thrills and some cool invisible sequences. Perhaps the movie was a little too long and some of the tropes may take you out of it, but it was creative and had some unexpected twists, despite the trailers giving most of the movie away.Recommended for: Fans of thrillers, or people who want to see Elisabeth Moss scream at nothing for 2 hours."
361,"Without spoiling: the film has a really great premise but the execution is a little sloppy regarding some of the choices by the protagonist. Unfortunately there were a few times she failed to take the obvious steps to end the ""nightmare"" which could have ended the film sooner. However, these choices and turns lead the film to a satisfying ending. So, it's hard to get too mad at the film."
362,"This film was so intense to watch that it feels like you are living the same nightmare as the lead character. You are willing her on every step of the way, but understand why no-one believes her story. Some excellent set pieces and shocking moments makes this good horror/thriller entertainment and makes you realise there is so much potential to reimagine those classic horror monsters films."
363,"""The Invisible Man"" is the third film directed by Whannell yet he is an extremely seasoned horror veteran and is one of the bigger icons of the genre. An auteur by nature, he seemed to at least have creative control over the substance of this movie and everything that went on screen, similarly to his previous movies. Though this is a really good movie, that's also just what hampers it: the substance. The structure of this movie is odd to say the least. The substance seems a bit melodramatic and although it keeps you interested, the movie almost feels more like a drama than a horror while none of the genres listed on imdb for the film are drama. This is a mature horror film. There aren't a ton of kill scenes but there is enough violence overall. There is one part where a large sum of people are attacked but the number of casualties is few to none. The mystery here is engaging but also very see through. There are basically no secrets, but there is drive to see what comes next. Leigh Whannell is an extremely talented writer and director and he is passionate about film. This is all clear as ""The Invisible Man"" is a straight shot of quality filmmaking. You cant knock the dude for much because you still feel the passion for the craft regardless of this films outcome. It was good. Very good. Not great. As much of a fan I am of Whannell I honestly can't see why this movie has garnered a rating higher than 7.0 but then again im glad the rating is so high. It deserves it. He deserves it. Id like to see him hit three 7.0 or higher rated films in a row."
364,"A new take on an old movie, I liked what they did with this. I enjoyed it."
365,"Watched this with my partner we've watched some rubbish lately like the possessor so was thrilled after watching this.
Really good story line, kept me on edge. Jumpy parts.really good ending. Definatley recommend watching it."
366,"This movie is the modern age remake of the previous ""The invisible man"" movies which is originally adapted from the novel The invisible man written by H.G. Wells. What makes this movie so special and different from the previous movies is that of it's usage of nothingness as the villain. The use of emptiness along with sophisticated visual effects enhanced the horrifying scenes as well as the twists which are present throughout the movie kept us glued to our seats till the end. I am sure that after watching this movie it will be with us for quite a some time."
367,"Yes there are lots of plot holes - not only can he not be seen, he can't be heard or smelt or.....And why is he so strong? Why is his suit so strong and unstainable etc?Why would this amazingly intelligent guy spend hours and hours stood in a corner in his invisible suit not eating or going to the loo etc. just so he can torment his wife? Why not just kill her? Why not just appear now and then instead of being a constant presence so he's even with her in a locked prison cell?All of these things and more will annoy you as you watch but it doesn't really matter - few stories, let alone Hollywood films, make logical sense.Moss is great as are all the actors, the cinematography is beautiful as is the production in general and it's thrilling and scary.Watch it."
368,The previous versions of this movie left me not expecting much but what a difference a talented director makes. In this story of the man who discovers a way to render himself invisible the tension is kept taut all the way. I was roped in immediately. The cast is spot on - both the casting and acting is great. While the special effects are beautifully fluid they are not overwhelming. A great ride.
369,"The Invisible Man is a very unique suspenseful story about shows the abusive side of technology. The main character is very well acted, you can see her carrying the trauma in her eyes the whole movie. The movie shot and directed with an extremely tense style with wife and quiet spaces, every moment feeling like it's in anticipation of a jump scare. However the sci-fi and the horror is uneven, however it doesn't stop the movie from getting more unsettling, which it certainly does. This is a quiet, suspenseful and engaging thriller in a time where it seems jump scares and gore reign."
370,"So entertaining! But very cheesy during many scenes, was able to predict what would happen next at least a hand full of times.Still would recommend!!"
371,"Very good movie, it keeps you in suspense all the time."
372,"For the horror side, it's totally open the world of horror in other level. Someone is nearby you but u cannot see, and he will harm you whatever whenever he wants. The 2 hours film totally in a right pace and nil one minute is a blah. For the storyline, it's fit and logical for any aspects. An abusive relationship trigger the escape and setup. With the rational story demonstrating something irregular by some future high technology. It interests me to think what if i have that cloth, lots of imagination post movie. Not just scary, enjoyable if you are sci-fic fans."
373,"In accordance with you-know-what and resulting theatre closures around the globe, Blumhouse brings their take on H.G. Wells' Invisible Man straight to streaming; albeit after a brief, Universal-distributed theatre run. Ostensibly, this is Universal's latest attempt at introducing a Shared Universe for their classic movie monsters (who all but invented the Cinematic Universe model in the 1930s), but The Invisible Man does something different, making me hope it definitely ain't of the same cloth as 2017's Mummy.Directed by Leigh Whannell (co-creator of Saw and director of Upgrade), this one stars Elisabeth Moss as a deeply traumatized woman whose ""invisible man"" is an allegory for a force of torment others refuse to see, writing the victim off as hysterical (whether or not there exists a literal Invisible Man in the text, I will leave a secret). Moss, it seems, is set to be one of the modern scream queens.In the movie, she gives another superb performance, portraying a character whose descension is believable. Considering what she does later, I wonder if those who outright admire the character are also among the critics who read the allegedly harmful message of DC's Joker as ""Marginalized Group X are monsters waiting to happen"". I don't think either film is subtextually saying this; I just wonder if there might be parallels between the fanbases of Cecilia Kass and Arthur Fleck, and if one nonetheless finds that the other glamorizes violence.All the same, I was solidly involved in the mystery and horror of the text itself, each new development bringing protagonist Cecilia (Moss) closer to madness. The filmmaking complements the unease with its lighting, camera work, scoring, and so forth - judging plainly from his limited directorial catalog, Whannell is quite good with atmosphere.Reimagining this classic as an allegory for modern-day women's concerns is a welcome choice, and I'm trying to put my finger on why it works here. That is, if we set aside the fact that it is better-acted, better-lit, better-shot, more mature, more visually inventive, and all-around better as a movie than the likes of Ocean's 8 (and Watchmen, for the most part).To be precise, I usually don't see the point of trying to reinvent an old franchise, either through sequel or reboot, as a hiply progressive rouse, not only because this may unnecessarily irritate neckbeard fanboys (good for PR, but sometimes bad for ticket sales). I usually argue that women deserve to star in original movies, crafting new female characters - as opposed to female ""versions"" - for us to admire, which will gradually erode sexism, or so the filmmakers may hope.Hell, the sort of bloggers and critics who will defend recently woke-ified franchises like Ghostbusters and Star Wars even dislike the idea of being beholden to what came before, as proven by a recently popular article decrying the very idea of ""canon"". A film like Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which is widely thought to go against ideas and rules presented in preceding films, supposedly shouldn't have to care about that in the first place. Thus I once again ask: why don't you just make a brand new movie? The answer is naturally that Disney and Lucasfilm enjoy money and publicity; let's not pretend all these woke toy commercials come from an auteur's mind.This may be the main reason The Invisible Man, another reimagining with aspirations of serving The Cause, actually works. It does, in fact, play like a person's vision - on top of being well-crafted in the ways I've listed (I also wouldn't say the revamping offends Wells, if that sort of thing does matter). Disagree with its thesis all you want; at least it's not pretending for the sake of getting Tumblr moms to purchase Rey figurines and annoy other fans.This doesn't mean the film is perfect (it has its plot conveniences and pop scares, in addition to certain silly visuals), but it is sure to entertain. Ultimately, for all the silly dreck we've gotten from them, Blumhouse (like A24 and various streaming companies) may be another place where the geniuses go to flourish nowadays."
374,"Crazy that the top user review laments the film fails to explore the abusive sociopathic husband character. There's been too many films with strong females, clearly, we need more insight into abusive men. The film isn't about the husband. The person who wrote that review has a series case of tunnel vision with a bizarre focus.The film itself is a taut, scary thriller where most of the terror comes from being in an inexplicable and awful situation where no one believes you and no one sees your pain. The invisible man is a commentary on abuse in our society. It's often invisible."
375,They tried to make it more spectacular than it made sense and the ruined the logical sequence of the whole movie. It would be way better if they busted him in a more logical and realistic way and on in that ludicrous way that had as only goal to glorify elisabeth's character
376,"The performance of the female lead really surprised me. I have always been blind to European and American actors, and I am not sure if I have seen other works before. As far as the work of ""Invisible Man"" is concerned, the acting skills of the heroine really make me feel amazing. At the beginning of the film, the hostess took advantage of her husband's deep sleep to carry out her planned escape journey. Even her husband's deep sleep was the sleeping medication she had taken in advance in the water he drank. The escape process, as the audience is familiar with, will inevitably be a little bumpy. When escaping to the garage, a vehicle alarm was touched, but fortunately, it was successful to escape all the way from the seaside high-rise villa to the city road. In this video, the pen is buried in a clear and open, close-up of a tool like a hanger. The husband found that his wife escaped and chased the medicine bottle picked up next to the door where the hostess was riding. It was simple and rough."
377,"Right from the start, the film hooks you, right into the very end. As far as flaws go, there are some plot holes or some things which don't make a lot of sense but that is full and far between. There are actually some amazing sequences in here especially a brilliant once in a psych ward against a bunch of armed officers. Elizabeth Moss is terrific. She carries this film and delivers the best performance. I think how the film recreates an iconic character and brings it into the modern day is equally as impressive."
378,"The Invisible Man was orignated by H.G Wells in 1897, brought to life in 1933, and now remade in 2020 by the director of Upgrade, & Insidious 3, Leigh Whannell. Whannell had his hand all over this production, taking over the producing & the screenwriting, while also directing. Let me just say, I'm not the biggest horror film guy, but Leigh Whannell can make a damn good horror film! His direction had great lingering, rotational camera work, with great camera suggestion. With the concept at hand, it leaves you thinking ""did I just see something?""The story line was very focused, while having a few open ended re-writes, with some great twists. He sharpened all the classic sci-fi/horror/thriller genre tools, creating this edge of your seat thriller! Whannell had you guessing at all times, while the audience is trying to connect the pieces that just don't seem to fit. The way Leigh Whannell wraps everything up, is nothing short of genius! He makes you rethink everything that's happened, leaving great conversation for after the film.The very talented Elisabeth Moss KILLS her performance! Her emotions are beautifully sold, making it easy to be able to get behind her. Aldis Hodge came out of no where at first, but ended up being a decent addition, being kind-hearted, and somewhat funny as well. Storm Reid was really nothing more than another plot device, but she made the most out of her screen time, showing believable emotions and reactions. Michael Dorman & Oliver Jackson-Cohen, we're basically cut from the same cloth. They were both diabolical, sly & mischievous. They both put on good performances, making you feel some type of negative way towards them. My only issue with the characters; it seemed like they came out of nowhere, leaving us to infer where they came from, for the most part. Essentially it works, but I just would've liked a little more on all of our characters, besides our lead, because she gets more than enough enjoyable characterization.The cinematography by Stefan Duscio had a very deep and dark tone to it. Each scene was beautifully lit by either natural lighting, or from a single light source, creating this eerie tone. Not only was the CGI done very well, but their practical effects felt so real, it made you feel like you were in the movie, backed up with INSANE sound mixing, and a creepy and dark score.Though I really enjoyed this movie, I did have a few notable nitpicks. It's inevitable to have convenient scenes, and imbalances, especially with a horror film, but there was just a few too many, leading into a few plot gaps, with the logic that you needed to buy into. For a film that talks about cameras for a decent portion, some things could've easily been solved by security cameras.Overall, if you take this film too seriously, you may not enjoy it in it's entirely, but I found it to be a blast, with decent scares, a solid narrative, and a great ending."
379,"The first third of the film focused on building tension around the concept. There were some nice shots here but I thought it was a bit too slow. The dialogue and acting were competent but nothing special. In the middle some crazy stalking-stuff happened, which sometimes came across as unintentionally comical or illogical, but was generally fine. The latter third was a quite solid action-thriller with a few twists. After the slow start I hadn't been expecting so much action. The CGI was excellent too. There were a few jump-scares throughout but overall I didn't find the movie very scary.There was a somewhat feminist vibe to the whole thing (escaping a gas-lighting stalker) but it didn't come across as heavy-handed or preachy. There was a little overly on-the-nose dialogue but it was at least trying to show-not-tell. The main character approached things in a semi-believable feminine way rather than a cliched action-girl way. Honestly I was kind of itching for her to throw a few more punches even though that wouldn't have fit her character, oh well.Overall I'd probably give it a 3/5. People really into thrillers or women who empathize more directly with the main character's experiences might enjoy it more. Bear in mind that I had a headache and the theatre sound was too loud for me so that might affect how I perceived the movie."
380,Elizabeth Moss has turned into one of the best actresses of her generation. I saw lots of people criticizing the films plot but honestly I saw it as much more of a character study than anything. Will definitely watch again.
381,"It is a film to enjoy with the family, its content together with the drama and suspense made it enjoy it to the fullest"
382,"Compared with the so-called high concept horror films in the past, This movie is indeed on a higher level. The whole process of tight atmosphere and the moment when the invisibility cloak suddenly flashes have quite impressive frightening effect. As for the logic problems that can't fit perfectly, probably no horror film can really show no flaws."
383,"I was frustrated by little things here and there that I could look past, but the biggest disappointment for me was how Adrian faked his own kidnapping to get out of faking his own death; ripped straight from Gone Girl."
384,"Like many of the other films of its generation, this film follows a similar route. However, our main character has more to her than meets the eye. Get it watched. Good film and rather edgy."
385,"There are a lot of slow-moving scenes in the movie, which can make you follow the main character and wonder if the seemingly empty place is really hiding something."
386,"The Invisible ManThere's lots to like about this latest take on 'The Invisible Man'.
The story does become a little far- fetched towards the end but hey if you've made it that far watching a movie about an invisible man then your probably not going to care.When Cecilia's abusive ex-boyfriend takes his own life and leaves her his fortune, she begins to suspect his death was a hoax. As a series of creepy coincidences turn lethal, Cecilia works to prove that she is being hunted by someone nobody can see.Elisabeth Moss does a fine job as Cecilia, her performance teeters on the insane as those onscreen do not believe her claims.
We the audience know she's not crazy as the jump scares and tension are handled wonderfully by director Leigh Whannell.
This movies starts out like the horror movies from the good old days. Whannell takes his time building his story. There's some terrifying set pieces in this movie. The blanket scene being one immediately springing to mind.
The director utilises the tried and tested method of its not what you see but what you don't see that's frightening.
This is handy really considering this film is about an invisible man.
Sound is also used effectively with the use of heavy bass to make the audience jump.
As a Blumhouse production there's a similar feel running through their movies. The cinematic look reminded me of 'Upgrade',
another one of their offerings that I recommend you check out.
The colour palette and onscreen vibrancy is dull and muted. This helps convey a sense of desperation. There's no sunshine and rainbows here as Cecilia is made to look like a lunatic.This movie was on course for a solid 8/10 until like many modern horror movies, the final act becomes a disappointing anti-climax.
The whole invisible suit idea for me was a step in the wrong direction.
Cecilia's boyfriend turns out to be a deranged version of Tony Stark who's made a suit that allows the wearer to vanish.
Whilst this was entertaining I would of preferred a more supernatural approach.
That said 'The Invisible Man' is one of the better modern day horror offerings.
Mainly elevated by a superb lead performance and some creepy set pieces that are masterfully staged and directed."
387,"Hmm.. It was like Okay at the best lol. It was 2 hours of building something good which never happened. Beginning was interesting and intense but then from the middle action and plot started to be hideous. Killing, punching, smashing, emails , oh Gosh, I was very disappointed. I was hoping much more from this movie. Possible to watch but would I recommend this to someone? Probably not."
388,"The motives of the antagonist were purely vague.I don't understand why would someone be that dumb to not check CCTV footage at restaurants to back Cecile claims.I also don't understand why Adrian's brother would do something that impulsive to his brother & his brother's wife.Yes, the antagonist is Adrian's brother, and I somehow feel that Adrian was indeed innocent and Cecile didn't wanna accept that.
Or perhaps lack of back story was missing to see things from Cecile's perspective, I mean what Adrian actually did to Cecile?
The suit was amazing, using optics technology for suit was a brilliant idea.
The movie just wanted to show an amazing optics technology of suit nothing else."
389,"Good start oof movie with pretty good pace, at mid point a bit heavier with lots of paranoia. Nobody is believing the protagonist as the ex boyfriend is apparently invisible and isolating her psychologically & physically.
A bit over fetched but still entertaining to an extend."
390,"Great movie with some predictable scenes, but I enjoyed it."
391,Can someone please explain how she got that paint can open?? Who leaves a paint can with paint still in it open?? It would dry up fast af. I can't sleep because it's driving me crazy!
392,"A fun thriller that can't escape its intentions to be a part of Universal's Dark Universe before that plan was scrapped.The Invisible Man tries to make it on its own, attempting to make sense of the nonsensical, but all the while the left over ideas and plot from the Dark Universe are apparent and take the movie from a reality into a fantasy land.Elizabeth Moss's character makes stupid and unrealistic choices and the ex boyfriend seems to have super human strength, agility and speed that I found distracting.Even with the weird and unrealistic plot - it's still a fun dark, slightly sci-fi thriller."
393,"Sound and light are not the essence of horror movies, invisible colorless but the spirit of the oncoming oppression is, ""invisible man"" just set this point is enough to thrill. And the small cost is good here, all the design is not redundant, the set is simple, the audio-visual control of one go, but also rely on the strong performance of the heroine to support the whole movie. Yulan restaurant can be used as before and after the dividing line, the last half an hour of debunk and reversal in front of the full foreshadowing under quite solution. In addition to the horror cloak, the invisible man is also the resistance and rise of independent women."
394,"Can somebody explain the ending to me?
How the hell did she have the time to change into the suit and kill him and then change back in a matter of seconds?"
395,"Now that's what I call a horror movie with a new idea, solid acting and good ending."
396,A not scary horror story that is thrilling - and it's not a remake of the 30s classic. It's an inventive twist of the old tale.
397,"It's a slow burn film but very well made, Elizebeth Moss is excellent and the supporting cast was good too. I liked the story it was different."
398,"This film fits into the same box as Sleeping With the Enemy, Enough, Extremities, Gothic and others where a woman becomes more than what her tormentors bargained for. While these movies have various stories they all play on fears women must have in common as the driving factor. Not being believed, abuse, manipulation, isolation, helplessness, the feeling of being watched all get their time playing on her psyche. I'm thinking many women will be followed home by anxiety. The metamorphosis of Cecilia when she finds herself trapped is as dramatic as Sarah Connor between the first and the latest Terminator movie.
The title 'The Invisible Man' is a bit unfortunate though, something like Unseen Eyes or Man of 1000 Eyes would have eliminated certain expectations which never come to pass. One of the coolest aspects of the film is the tech is actually real and has been for some time now.
The movie unfolds with C (Cecilia) making her escape from the house/mad scientist lab she shares with her betrothed Adrian with the help of a friend. Unsure how she will go on with life she soon begins to feel the presence of her now dead husband (suicide, just look at these 8x11 glossies!). Lawyer brother of her deceased husband informs her 5 million dollars is coming her way provided she doesn't fall into vice and criminality. I would like to think some things that happen next are aimed at punishing theater attendees who have divided attentions, watch close or you'll miss it! Not much time goes by before C is tagged with a drug problem followed by a murder while screaming about the man nobody can see but her. Now locked in a psych ward we will get our first clear look at her tormentor as he goes through an entire symphony orchestra of armed guards who must be in Stormtrooper training. C breaks free of the ward hot on the trail winding up at her friends house to thwart the next diabolical ploy. After tagging the apparition figure by spraying a fire extinguisher around C pops 5 or 6 rounds into his chest. When she pulls off the mask the person she expected see isn't there, later being found tied up in a closet the very next scene. C doesn't buy it so she seizes control of her destiny by her own hand.
While suffering from occasional bouts with continuity and flip a coin character actions the final product as a whole is fairly entertaining with a big wet spot of believability not of the characters but of the tech and the ways it will be abused. Be prepared for a feeling of being watched following you around for a few days after so don't start shooting at every house noise."
399,"Here is a film that needs to be seen. The tension of the unseen is masterful. The acting, story and filming is really well done. The concept - a bit stretched, but hey, it is a sci-fi. I am just very glad they did not go with the whole injection to turn invisible concept again. This was definitely a fresh approach - that paid off.Overall, a good time spent in front of the telly. I did not even look at my cellphone once - which is the case if a film is boring.A must watch sci-fi thriller, scoring a well deserved 7 out of 10 stars!*Hand Clapping*"
400,"Leigh Whannell's third outing as writer-director is a fresh take on old material, bolstered by a strong leading performance from Elisabeth Moss. Thankfully avoiding the cookie-cutter feel of many horror flicks from low-budget powerhouse Blumhouse Productions, it's not without its flaws like some clumsy plot developments & smash cuts, yet where the film truly shines is in its exploration of abuse & gaslighting7/10 knives at the dinner table.."
401,"The Invisible Man directed by Leigh Whannell is a remake from a story by H.G. Wells. The movie follows the life of Cecilia Kass, a young woman brilliantly played by Elisabeth Moss. Low key lighting sets the opening scene, where Cecilia is shown sneaking around her luxurious, minimalist, and modern bedroom in the dark. While her partner Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) sleeps, she rummages for a bottle of pills under her mattress and eventually takes one in the bathroom. We see her walk to her closet, open a secret compartment, and pack a duffel bag. As she continues creeping around in the dark which feels like forever but effectively builds my anxiety through the roof, she mistakenly kicks a large silver dog bowl across the living room, causing a loud commotion and giving the audience a well-placed jump scare. She walks down toward the garage and opens the door only to be surprised by her pet Doberman. Feeling guilty for leaving him behind, she attempts to remove his shock collar however, he bumps into the car setting off the alarm.As she runs down the hill, we continue to get the creepy feeling she will be caught at any moment thanks to the amazing score. Cecilia makes it to a dirt road in search of someone or something. At this point in the film, I was sure her fianc√© would catch her and drag her back up the hill. Instead, a woman pulls up in an SUV which we later find out is her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer). Before Cecilia can explain what is going on, Adrian appears out of the pitch-black woods and punches through her passenger window. The women narrowly escape, but Cecilia unknowingly drops her pill bottle on the ground, which Adrian finds.The audience is given a moment to breathe through all the tension, with a view into Cecilia's new life, living at her friend James' (Aldis Hodge) house with his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). This new environment with warm, cozy, and bright lighting is the perfect scene for a new start. The tension quickly rises again though, as we see how hard it is for Cecilia to literally go outside of her comfort zone. James is there for her, like a comforting bowl of chicken tortilla soup, all while looking stunningly fit and handsome. We know something is coming, we just don't know what.As the day progresses, Emily shows up with some unnerving news. Adrian has committed suicide. This doesn't seem to settle too well with Cecilia, as she is still visibly shaken by the mention of his name alone. Emily assures her this is the best news that can come of the situation, since Cecilia will finally be free. Not only do we learn Adrian is dead, he left his ex a massive amount of cash. This feels like a sick trick from the start, but Cecilia decides to take the bait and accept a meeting with Adrian's brother, Tom (Michael Dorman). With the funds hitting her account, she shows her gratitude to James by purchasing him a new ladder as a gag gift and asks Sydney to check if there's anything at the top. Sydney happily climbs the ladder and discovers an envelope containing information to her new checking account, with funds scheduled to be deposited once a month, enabling her to attend her dream University. Everything is starting to get better piece by piece.Cecilia is getting braver by the day, and able to go outside more often, but she may be seeing things? Why is she so cold and why is the blanket on the floor? Why isn't the blanket moving off the floor? Are those footsteps?! Okay so maybe she appears a bit paranoid. Odd things are happening but not anything drastic or anything she can prove. Just that horrifying feeling she is being watched. So, she trudges forward by attending a job interview which she's prepared for. She brings her portfolio along but embarrassingly her sketches are nowhere to be found. At the interview, she faints, prompting a doctor's visit where we learn she is pregnant. With her progressively bizarre behavior, she starts to alienate her roommates and ultimately, her sister receives a nasty email written from one of her accounts. She's spiraling out of control and increasingly paranoid. There must be a clue or tangible proof to what is happening, so she decides to take an Uber to the house of horrors, aka Adrian's mansion. Walking around this vast, cold place, she discovers a room with a camera and discovers an invisible suit. After placing the suit in the secret compartment in the closet, that horrible feeling of being watched quickly returns, so she jumps back into the Uber and drives off.Thankfully, her sister agrees to meeting her for dinner to discuss her health. The nauseatingly snobby waiter at the LA restaurant prompts a hilarious exchange with Emily, allowing for some comedic relief. As Cecilia attempts to explain the odd things she's experiencing, and how they are linked to Adrian, the audience receives a shocking scare as we watch Emily's throat being slit by a flying knife. Cecilia goes into full panic mode, sitting there like a deer in headlights, frozen with horror as the knife flies into her hand. The rest of the patrons quickly realize what is going on, and scramble to get away from this murderous monster.Poor Cecilia cannot catch a break, as she's thrown into a psychiatric facility. Her friend James, attempts to defend her by interviewing her in a ""safe"" way, trying to see things from her perspective. She continues to talk about Adrian being behind all of this, and how he somehow has managed to become invisible, just adding to her crazy. Fed up with being ignored by everyone, Cecilia knows tonight is the night she will battle it out with Adrian. She forces him to reappear when she wants, by slitting her wrists, therefore placing her unborn child's life in jeopardy. Adrian places pressure on the wound, giving her the perfect opportunity to stab him multiple times, causing damage to the suit. A security guard walks in and gets attacked by Adrian as well as a group of other security guards in the hallway. Whannell makes a point to show us that all of this is caught on the facilities' cameras, perhaps to explain something in a sequel. Cecilia can escape Adrian's grip, for the time being.Desperately needing this to end, she decides to meet with Adrian face-to-face to reconcile. This is the second time in the entire film, that the audience sees Adrian without his suit. He's visibly nervous, almost charming, and decides to order three different entrees for dinner. Cecilia opts for the steak and begins light conversation by asking Adrian to confess to all he's done. Refusing to do so, like a true psychopath, brings Cecilia to tears. She asks to use the bathroom and the next thing we know, Adrian slits his own throat, with the very steak knife he'd given Cecilia. This is all captured on the in-home security cameras, with the final scenes showing Cecilia calling 911 and walking triumphantly out of the house for the final time."
402,"If you don't want to spoil some great suspense and jump scares, I really recommend not watching the trailer! Just believe when I say it is worth it. Great suspenseful movie made incredibly better by the score. A little predictable on the story but still has cool foreshadowing of a fine and thrilling ride. Really, what a well executed nightmarishly-planned torture for the wife. The only thing I didn't really like was the amount of plot holes, don't read too much into them it can diminish the experience a little bit. Overall a good movie, with great performances."
403,"For some reason this movie was tons of fun, there was a great lead performance from the the always brilliant elisabeth moss and some scenes were so tense i felt like i was inside of the back of my chair. it is a great introductory horror film for a teen who wants to try horror. despite all of these great features my favorite part of the movie is actually the sound design. it's done so well that at times it feels like i could hear the guys breathing and it had me searching every frame for something i knew i couldn't find. another exceptional part of this movie is the camerawork and cinematography. it's so creative in the way it will film the corner or follow an object or individual we can't see, this makes us constantly on edge because we are either told the invisible man is in the same room as our antagonist or it's all left to our imagination. this is far scarier than us knowing exactly where he is. however for this film to work you have to embrace its overall silliness or you won't enjoy it. you also have to be able to see past a couple of brief plot holes such as the fact that cameras don't exist but if these things don't massively bother you while watching a film then you will have a great time watching this giant surprise of a movie."
404,Like the 1963 thriller 'The Haunting' this new version is the H.G. Wells classic works best when what frightens you is not seen. Once the magic is revealed so too is the source of mystery and terror. The 2020 movie certainly provides suspense and Elizabeth Moss does a very credible job as a woman being driven to madness. Up to a point. There are some plot holes and some logic holes but all in all it is a suspenseful and very watchable film.
405,I enjoyed this version of the Invisible Man but their were so many holes in the plot . **SPOILERS** Cecilias sisters death seemed downplayed. I never could figure out the relationship between Cecilia and the cop. How was the suit manufactured ? so many unanswered questions but the actress who played Cecilia was definitely strong enough to carry this movie. Had it been anyone else the movie may have flopped. Good movie despite the plot holes .
406,"Horror films I seem to struggle with these days in that I don't enjoy them but each year we seem to get at least one or two really good ones and for me the invisible man is one of them.
The subtle scares and the slow introduction of the invisible man made this a great chilling thriller.
Elizabeth Moss is a fine actress and she really pulls through on many emotions throughout the film."
407,"After the great success of Upgrade which has easily gotten into my personal top 10 movies of 2010s I knew I had to see the next creation by Leigh Whannell. Known only as a horror director and screenwriter before he returned to his more habitual genre in The Invisible Man, a somewhat remake/reboot version of a classic by H.G. Wells. I never fancied horrors thinking of them as shallow, superficial, nothing to think about kind of stories that are only meant to scare you. Sadly this one is no exception but Mr. Whannell brings his own style into this modern take on the classic story of a narcissistic maniac with obsessiveness issues and God syndrome. Visually the movie is amazing and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the ending. Stylistically it's almost the perfect example of a fine thriller with a lot of broader score options than just scary sounds and screamers. The actors are doing their best as well but only Elisabeth Moss keeps the bar high. In short, after Upgrade it just feels like a step back for the director, although a solid one."
408,"Leigh Whannell has done a great job of resurrecting a classic horror figure for a modern generation. It hits the ground running with a heart thumping opening scene, sprinting and tiptoeing alternately over 2 hours with plenty of fresh ways to keep you on the edge of your seat, as well as unpredictable twists which are well placed throughout the plot.First half horror, second half sci-fi thriller, it is a real teeth gritting ride. A couple of scenes are real shockers you would not have expected (without spoiling anything, there's a particular scene that takes place in a restaurant and you will not expect what happens) and an ending that is just awesome and well worth the wait.Clever, cool and worth a watch if you like jump scared and a brooding atmosphere."
409,"I initially had no interest in seeing this film, thinking it'd be like every other horror remake. However, you are engaged from the beginning, and are constantly feeling on edge. The first half of the film has a bigger budget Paranormal Activity vibe, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Elisabeth Moss continues to expand on her niche, and plays this role so naturally. While predictable at points, this film exceeded my expectations and would definitely recommend."
410,"I ignored the ""me too"" factor and enjoyed this film very much.
Plenty of jolts. The director did a great job.
Don't go to the flicks much these days but glad I did for this one."
411,"This is a rare remake that actually works. The tension that builds throughout the film keeps you thoroughly interested and the scares work as well. The lead actress put together a solid performance and the character was likable/compelling.The narrative had some plot holes and minor conveniences that may take you out of the film slightly. This isn't a massive issue with the film, in my opinion.My major issue with this film was the lack of character depth and charisma of the villain. He just didn't come off as a character that you could understand the motives of. The ladder half of the film has some events that happen and you dont particularly feel anything when this man is involved. I believe this film would have benefitted a ton from having a more charismatic actor, along with a compelling back story for his character. When the invisible man is on screen, or not on screen I should say, he is an amazing villain and very creepy. But the actual human character named Griffin they portrayed was rather weak.Despite that major issue I have, this film entertained me and kept me on the edge of my seat for a good majority of the runtime. Definitely a good time at the cinema."
412,"I almost made the mistake of listening to the haters posting about how it was, etc. Fortunately it was over 6.0/10, so it passed my minimum criteria.
I loved it! Of course it's not realistic, and I don't understand the haters who complained about that. (Were you okay with Harry Potter's invisibility cloak?) The storyline was great, they pulled off the invisibility aspect and I was invested in what was going to happen. It did leave me kind of second guessing myself at the end about what was a lie and what wasn't, but that doesn't bother me. It makes for good conversation!"
413,"When this film was first announced I wasn't really looking forward to it at all because I was still getting the bad taste of The Mummy 2017 out of my mouth. However, once it was announced that Leigh Whannel was set to write and direct. I knew it was in good hands.I have been a fan of Leigh Whannel since his work on the Insidious franchise and his amazing but extremely underrated film Upgrade. This film is great with amazing acting from Elziebeth Moss who is being haunted by her boyfriend of a previous abusive relationship who is now somehow invisible. The film is always building up the tension and due to the fact that he is invisible, they do camera angles where it's as if he is always watching her even though he might not be there at all. Having a budget of only 9 million dollars the effects are great and it's extremely impressive with all the scars they get out of it. In the directing department, Whannel is fantastic by creating a creepy atmosphere and leaving you with not a single moment to breathe. As for flaws, the only real one I have with the film is that the tone of the last half is extremely different from the first half of the film. Well, the second half is still just as good the first half there tones are extremely different. So it can at times feel like two different films though both halves are still great and extremely entertaining. Overall The Invisible Man is a great horror film being one the best ones I have seen in years its everything you would want in an Invisible Man movie. If this is now what the new films based on Universal's classic monster will be like then I can't wait."
414,"Unpredictable jump scares, top-notch acting, great screenplay and the director from UPGRADE (2018)! No crap. Just watch this film, that's all."
415,"Well done! Hard to mix modern technology and horror but the writers did so well with this! I love a twist, but really love double twists! The lead actress totally carried this movie. The camera-work really made you keep your eyes on the screen, even when you really didn't have to. That's smart directing. Thinking back, that actress went through a series of emotions and did awesome.
Personally, if I were invisible, I can think of 10 things I'd do than harass a woman, but then again, I live in a different reality. So glad I saw this. Will recommend."
416,"After the epic failure that was The Mummy in 2017, it appeared as the though the high-profile Dark Universe series developed by Universal Studios was well and truly DOA.Low and behold though and 3 years on, Australian director/writer and all-round everyman Leigh Whannell has managed to breathe life into this shared universe, with help from master producer Jason Blum, by delivering a tension-riddled and character driven horror/thriller hybrid that showcases what can be done when story comes first ahead of spectacle and large-scale focus.At one time set to star Johnny Depp and likely too be a far more over the top affair, Whannell's version of The Invisible Man story, that has been seen in different incarnations for over 100 years, is a stripped back and relevant delivery of the tale that doesn't try to connect to any of the other possible ""Dark Universe"" properties, as it instead follows Elizabeth Moss's distressed Cecilia Kass trying to escape the clutches of an abusive relationship at the hands of Oliver Jackson-Cohen tech-genius Adrian Griffin.Including his lead actress in the script-writing process, Whannell and Moss have crafted a thought-out and layered journey for Kass to go through that adds depth to a film that could've otherwise been a mere gimmick as we are afraid of what at many times is the thing unseen.Learning tips and tricks off his fellow Australian and close friend James Wan, Whannell has through his efforts on Insidious Chapter 3 and the underrated action gem Upgrade honed his craft in an exciting fashion and his handling of The Invisible Man sees another step forward for the director being taken, with his use of empty space and calm is eerily unnerving, while the films choc-full of memorable scenes that will go down as some of the years most unforgettable (a paint can trick, a shocking restaurant date and a Hospital hallway showdown particular highlights).While his handling of the technical and editing is laudable, Whannell is also able to draw out another great turn from Moss, who continues to be one of the most exciting actresses working today, showcasing his ability as a director able to get his performers to bring their best to the table and become one with the material he is asking them to bring to life.There's a lot to love about The Invisible Man, providing a cinema experience not unlike the quiet audience viewings that A Quiet Place provided a few years back, unfortunately a few odd character decisions, plot devices and motivations at times don't always sit well within the films movements towards its end goals, elements that seal the fate of Whannell's film being well-above average for its genre but not quite the classic it could've been.Final Say -Another impressive effort from Australia's very own Whannell, The Invisible Man is a relevant and memorable reimagining of a classic tale that will have audiences on the edge of their seats more often than not.3 ¬Ω pairs of Nike shoes out of 5"
417,"Well, I'm not quite sure if this is what HG Wells envisioned when he originally wrote the story, but the filmmakers have certainly taken this concept in a different direction. The thing is that this film is much more of a thriller than a science fiction style of movie, so it does take its time to build up the tension, but as you watch it you do come to realise that this is actually needed for the film to work.So, we have this woman who happens to live with a rather controlling and abusive husband. Anyway, she escapes and later learns that he has died and she has inherited his fortune. Yeah, this guy is basically a tech billionaire. However there seems to be more going on than meets the eye because it seems that maybe, just maybe, he isn't dead.The film does indicate that not only is he a tech billionaire, but that he made his fortunate in the field of optics, which raises the suggestion that maybe he has found a way of becoming invisible, but then again he could just be a poltergeist. However, I don't think the film leaves that much open for that interpretation, though the trailers, at least when I first saw them, had that as a possibility.
Yeah, there are quite a few twists and turns in the film, and while I don't necessarily believe that the end really does leave any ambiguity, the thing that I did notice is that we don't actually get to see this guy all that much, and we certainly don't know who is in the suit - we just assume that it is him. Well, there are a few other clues as well, but the thing is that the film does attempt to be somewhat ambiguous in this regards.There is also the thing about the sound mind and body. Obviously nobody believes the protagonist in the film, especially since there is evidence that he happens to be dead. Mind you, it does explore the concept of the absusive relationship, and even explores the nature that it is not necessarily physical but could be quite psychological as well. Not surprisingly the protagonist is female, while the antagonist is male, and it is really all about how these types of people really get into your head and can be quite controlling.At first I found the film to be somewhat difficult to watch, and it certainly does take quite a while to pick up, but when it does it really does get pretty good. Once again, it was one of those films that when it was beginning I was sort of wandering why I was wasting my time with it, but once you reach the end, well, at least in my mind, I definitely felt that it was worth it."
418,"It's a shame that Universal did not put as much effort into there other ""Monster"" films as they did with The Invisible Man. Leigh Whannell's stab at the iconic characters is one of the best thrillers of the year. I found myself holding my breath from start to finish wondering what surprises would reveal themselves next. Elisabeth Moss puts on a haunting performance that so accurately represents a person in a controlling relationship that it's near impossible not to root for her. Overall The invisible man is a cannot miss for hardcore and casual movie fans."
419,"Cecilia Kass is living with her boyfriend Adrian Griffen, an optics genius. We are not given any backstory but introduced to the couple as Cecelia flees in the middle of the night. A few weeks later she is contacted by a lawyer, who happens to be Adrian's brother, to find out that Adrian has taken his own life and she is inheriting a substantial amount of money. Before too long Cecilia's new peace of mind is shattered as strange events start to happen and she becomes convinced that Adrian is still alive and has devised a way to become invisible and is now tormenting her.From the onset, this film delivers a great amount of tension, and it does not relent until the end. I found this to be one of the better entries into the modern horror/thriller genre and actually found myself jumping a few times. That last part is significant because I have watched my fair share of horror movies and thought myself immune to this reaction. This speaks volumes to the director and editor's skills. Elizabeth Moss delivers what is perhaps her finest work here as well as she captures with expertise her character's slow descent into despair as her life is forever changed by the events of this movie. Her performance even lends a doubt as to whether the events we see are real or simply in her head. This is the best film for this year, so far."
420,"This movie was filmed in what I felt was an extremely creative manner. A lot of the shots create very suspenseful settings. The movie has a bit of a slow start as it builds up the suspense, but then ramps up a lot about half way through the film. Some of the plot and character choices didn't make as much sense as I would have liked, but ultimately it didn't bother me too much. I didn't care too much for the very end of the movie either.It was definitely an interesting watch and I recommend to those who love suspenseful movies. Overall I felt it was a solid good movie that had some great high points, with a few parts that I felt didn't quite work."
421,"This is a new take on a classic story that had me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. Elizabeth Moss is fantastic, and frankly saves this movie from getting a poor rating from me.Unfortunately, there are so many ridiculous plot holes that expect the viewer to suspend belief in all things logical that it really kept this movie from reaching it's potential. Ending was lackluster at best. A lot of fantastic build up to a final feeling of, ""wait... what...that's it??!!"""
422,"Elisabeth Moss is not your stereotypical Hollywood actress . She's not the glamorous leading lady that would have starred in a film like this in previous decades and ""Amen"" to that because there are very few actresses around that play the victim quite as well as her as we've seen with her TV work in The Handmaid's tale and Mad Men and especially in The Invisible Man.She plays Cecilia, an abused girlfriend who finds out her partner leaves her his fortune after committing suicide , but she suspects his death is a hoax. As a series of coincidences turn lethal, She works to prove that she is being hunted by someone nobody can see.The first half hour of this movie is great . The tension is ramped right up as we follow Cecilia after she has escaped her abuser . We know things aren't going to go well but not when and how . The anxiety levels are high which is great but , and there is a big ""But"".
In the first party of the movie there is no mention of invisibly or an invisible man and it's only when that premise gets introduced do things start to get silly.
I like the idea of an invisible man that stalks his victim but I wasn't buying this story at all and I wished it had just remained a stalker / revenge flick .There is no denying that this is entertaining and I was definitely never bored but the longer it went on the more ridiculous it got which is a bit of shame.It's worth seeing for Moss's performance alone but don't expect a masterpiece."
423,Not a horror film but a very good thriller with a few twists and some great WTF moments. Didn't rely on stupid jump scares. Good plot and yes there is plot holes but come on just enjoy it. It's not real people. 8/10
424,"For what Invisible Man lacks it in logic it make up for in lack of pretense. Here, you have a horror-thriller that absolutely bolts into an engaging and well acted story.If you're looking for Terminator 2 tone of the past meets Friday the 13th then jump on board. Twists in turns, it's more than a one trick pony and if you're willing to suspend your disbelief then prepare to be highly entertained.Look, if you can't put all that aside you might find it tricky to enjoy... but it's February and twice as good as many big budget horrors try to be. While the substance and undertones of abusive relationships are ""common"" they are no or more less important. While this film lacks of the sophistication of some psycho horrors which were released a few years ago,: Green Room, Killing of a Sacred Deer, Blue Ruin, and others, those movies didn't do so well at the box office, thus making room for higher concept movies like Invisible Man.The Invisible Man might not be an instant classic but it should trail along nice. And inevitably yield an inferior sequel."
425,"I really didn't know what to expect, as there have been a few attempts at the ""invisible man"" story line. I was pleasantly surprised. The times when you weren't sure if anyone was there or not were quite spooky and, I must say, there were a couple of scenes that got me to jump out of my seat a bit.I gave it a 7 because there were a few things that bothered me. I don't want to mention them here because they could be considered spoilers. Nothing too terrible, but I did think, ""Oh, c'mon, now!"" on occasion.All in all, though, it was pretty suspenseful, well-acted, and ended with a bit of a twist."
426,"Is It Worth Watching: YesIs It Worth A Movie Ticket: YesThe Invisible Man is a movie that excels in one particular area: suspense. Once you allow yourself to step into the reality of the movie you realize that there is a crazy, invisible man who may be behind you at any moment. It becomes worse as that invisible man begins to torment you. You tell your friends and family, but they don't believe you. And the invisible man goes out of his way to isolate you, to destroy your integrity, to harm loved ones, and to prove that he is always in control.There are a lot of complaints about this movie and a few of them are justified. But these complaints can be easily forgiven if you take the time to appreciate what's important in the movie and what isnt. For example, people complain that this is a PC propaganda piece because it involves an abusive boyfriend (the invisible man) tormenting a woman who decides to leave him. However, that relationship isn't really ""important"" to the movie despite being much of its foundation. What's important is that there's an invisible bad guy and a victim who needs to find a way to fight back before their life is completely ruined.People also complain about some plot holes and technical issues. How does an invisible man drive around? Why is he so strong? Why didn't she take videos with her camera? These are the sort of complaints that are a little more justified and they are part of the reason this film doesn't go into the hall of fame. But if you can overlook these (very minor) problems, then you will find yourself on the edge of your seat as you watch this story unfold.You could compare this to movies like 6 Underground or Anchorman. The first of which is a movie that excels in terms of action. If you begin to focus on the mindless story elements, then you'll suspend your connection to the movie's reality and find it unlikable. Anchorman excels in raw comedy, but if you focus too much on the evolution of the main relationship and the potential real-life consequences of character actions, then you'll once again leave the reality of the movie and find it unlikable.Returning to my initial statement, this is a movie that excels in suspense. If you find yourself worrying about the political climate, what should have been done in a particular situation, or how a person can wash off a gallon of paint in 30 seconds, then you lose your connection to the reality of The Invisible Man and will miss out on an otherwise fun and suspenseful adventure.Finally, the play my own Devil's Advocate, the missing elements from this movie are what create a true masterpiece when they all come together. Had this story been a little more careful and thoughtful with some decisions it could have been even better. The Invisible Man may not be a masterpiece, but it doesn't take a masterpiece to drag me to the movie theater."
427,"For a premise that can easily come off as cheesy and cheap, the Invisible Man steps in the right direction to take itself seriously. Leigh Whannel channels his inner horror to induce anxiety and fear with very little cheap jump scares which is effective for modern horror films today. The story deals with thematic abuse with the strong performance from Elizabeth Moss making you invested and sympathetic. She keeps you on the edge of your seat right from the very beginning. The great use of camera work and sound (or little thereof) keep your eyes glued to the screen. The only faults with the film would be some of the script choices, making you wonder ""would that actually happen?"", or ""would this person actually do that?"" But that only merits the serious tone of the film.Overall, great performances and production, keeping you invested from beginning to end with solid pacing"
428,"Leigh Whannell has injected a shot of refreshing energy and smarts to the Horror Genre yet again like he did way back with James Wan's ""Saw"". ""Invisible Man"" is crazy smart! It employs a DOMESTIC TERROR that is truly horrifying not solely because of the impeccable sound design or the rising tension, but the gripping trauma a strong woman must endure to escape a vile predator. If you were a fan of Whannell's 2018 film, ""Upgrade"" you'll be equally as delighted with the SciFi action thrills to be had in this movie too. The production design is great. There's cool shots where the camera plays with space on screen that constantly puts you on edge. A legit STELLAR 10 min or so opening that will instantly hook you. And, what more can be said of the performance from Elizabeth Moss?
A WHOLE LOT.
This trend of GREAT contemporary Horror movie performances from incredible actresses is bolstered by a haunting take from Moss that's Award Worthy."
429,"This iis a good horror movie because there is nothing cheap about its approach. This is as much a horror movie as it a murder mystery.. No spoiler here, because there are a lot of surprises. Liz Moss, whom I'm not a fan, but I have to admit that her performance is superior and she is nothing short of perfect. Everything about her in this movie is believeable. The storyline is relevant for these times. The concept of an invisible man is tough to accept to any practical and educated person, however, the concept proposed here is interesting and doesn't overwhelm the story. This is good entertainment and possibly one of the best sleepers in the era of COVID movie releases."
430,"This Leigh Whannell's version of Invisible Man had a clich√®-ridden script that could ruin the entire movie if the plot twist wasn't executed well. The thrills and suspense are quite strong combined with the chilling sound mixing. The movie did a good job in suggesting audiences to pay attention on every details and shots that could make everyone wonder if the 'Invisible Man' was at a certain scene or not. Elisabeth Moss' performance made this movie even more engaging to watch. The plot is a bit dissapointing but Whannel managed to establish a game-changer. Overall, ""Invisible Man"" is a good suspense-thriller movie but it's too much to consider it as the horror movie representative of 2020."
431,"Mixed feelings all over the internet about this flick. Have seen it finally I do understand why. Is it a horror, not reall therefor it doesn't have a creepy atmosphere. For me it's more of a thriller.It do take a while before it all starts to happen. But once it does it do offer some suspense. effects are in the beginning just done with some off-camera tricks but the further we go the effects become way over mediocre.Some twists here and there makes it more than worthy to have a look at this flick. Some scene's can be a bit too gory for those not used to watch horror but overall it's low based on the red stuff.
Gore 0,5/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 4/5
Story 3/5
Comedy 0/5"
432,"Initial Thoughts:
As the viewer we're not given a ton of backstory into Cecilia, or her rich boyfriend Adrian, and that leaves us trying to piece together just how abusive and manipulating he truly was. All we're left with is her shaky words as she tries to let go of him. Once past the opening 30 minutes it gets juicy. Here's this normal girl just trying to live life when suddenly her world is rocked by an unknown presence. ""The Invisible Man"" uses a lot of time and space to build up suspense in this psychological thriller and that leads to an end that will leave you gasping for air.Pros:
Great camera work that truly brings the audience into the film. One moment you're being watched and the next moment you're watching ready to strike. I liked how the film isn't quick and dirty, but rather a slow build-up that eventually declines Cecilia's mental state.Cons:
Despite my enjoyment of the slow build-up, the film felt too long with some of the build-up to the tense moments. At times we're left staring into nothingness waiting for something to happen that never does. Other than that the film was almost seamless.Overall:
Great movie from Blumhouse. One of the few I've watched that didn't feel corny or cheesy. If you enjoy the psychological genre. I think you'd like this one. Most definitely adding this to my ""recommend to watch"" list."
433,"I had pretty high expectations going into this movie as I already heard a bunch of positive comments about it and thankfully it met those expectations. This is probably one of the best movies I've seen in recent years in regards of ''jaw dropping moments''. And not in the jaw dropping way of kills or gore, there's very little of that, but for certain moments that just left me gasping.Now by itself these moments might not make that much impact except for the exceptional acting and writing in this movie which makes you care so much for pretty much every character. These two things were the key to really grabbing your attention and taking you along. The one that caught me off guard the most was the sister in the restaurant, and it was such a heartbreaking kill as well. Mainly again because this movie made you care it really sucked to see her die like that. Once this happens the movie really turned and went all in and it was a exciting ride until the end. That said, the movie does not wait around to long to get things started which I really liked. I think about 30 minutes in iirc the stalking starts.The directing is really solid as well and definitely utilizes the concept of their being a presence really well in its shots, most if not all the shots are very wide, and you always have that notion that something me be standing in that empty space over there. That said, I felt like there were some missed opportunities regarding showing the presence of the invisible man, it has a few key moments, but in general I felt myself wanting a few more tiny clues, like drapes moving from the wind created by moving around, or just tiny moments you might not even notice. This might've made it too obvious though, but I missed a bit of paranoia or anxiety that the main character obviously experienced. This movie isn't really scary, the only things that will scare you are the obvious loud jumpscares in a very quiet movie but besides that there's nothing disturbing or scary. Which leads me to the invisible man himself, obviously just an invisible man isn't really scary so turning it into a scary thriller is pretty tough, there's no emotion to play with from the antagonist.Now the antagonist, also brilliantly acted although not as many lines as I've wanted. I would've loved to see a bit more of him as a person, to really get to see that narcissistic sociopath.There's a few plot holes/gaps that I wasn't that happy about. First off was the complete lack of narrative behind Adrian manipulating Tom into possibly murdering a cop's kid for him. All we know about Tom is that he's the brother and doesn't'' have a spine, but he does almost manage to kill a kid and manages to knock out a buff cop. Though the plot twist that came from this was something I did not expect at all and worked really well so.. maybe when he was in the suit he should've been more clumsy or nervous, something to notice something's slightly off. Another gap is how Cecilia manages to go to the bathroom, sneak into the wardrobe across the room, change into the suit, kill adrian and after like 10 seconds come out fully dressed again. It felt like a few too many things were once again left out just so that twist would work. So there are som sacrifices regarding the great twists that are a bit annoying but nothing too major.The soundtrack is fantastic as well, uses a ton of silence but when the music is there it's used really well and its damn good.The CGI was ... almost okay. It was noticeable, not bad, but you'd know instantly, at least I did. So I wished some more practical stuff was used. Like for example the invisible man throws over a table, and they made the table CGI whilst it could've been done practical and look a lot less distracting. Especially the animation was off on that.The ending was good. adrian got outsmarted by a thankfully competent protagonist. Like I said before they cut a bit too much near the end for the twist but all in all it worked.8/10 definitely recommend."
434,"It was entertaining, I'll give it that.
Probably won't rush to see it again."
435,"I was reluctant after reading the reviews but it turned out to be better than expected so in my opinion: worth watching, specially if you like Elizabeth Moss - which I do. It holds the suspense effect throughout the movie, Moss did a great job. But I do agree that the characters could have been better developed to bring more depth into their relationship but that is common in a thriller."
436,"You get what you expect from a horror movie called ""The Invisible Man"". Nothing more nothing less. It's not bad but it would be a stretch to call it a good film. It did trip me out one time I was in my house and thought I saw something with the side of my eye which turned out to be nothing. So I dunno.An abusive husband fakes his own death to be even more abusive to his wife by becoming invisible."
437,It might have been more interesting if they didn't put the big reveal in the title!
438,"This is a good movie, but it is not scary. Shouldn't be in the horror genre. Worth a watch, just don't go in expecting to be scared."
439,"This movie is great, don't get me wrong. I loved it. It kept me at the edge of my seat. This is definitely a thriller though, not a horror. It's not to much as a scary movie as a seat grabber. One issue is that. They can just check the security cameras... other than that, FANTASTIC!"
440,"This is a wonderfully entertaining movie, although it certainly doesn't have much new to offer. It is interesting, however, that the subject of the invisible man is reversed here and viewed from the perspective of an ""outsider"", i.e. his wife. And this is done in a very intriguing way - at least most of the time. At the beginning of the film some scenes felt like from a dull B movie horror film, but as the story goes on, things get more and more exciting. Generally, I liked how they sort of mixed ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" with sci-fi elements.
The actors fulfill their roles well, with one exception: the husband / invisible man himself. Unfortunately, this actor has no charisma, and the question arises as to why the wife would fall for him in the first place.
The plot holes criticized by some users are not such big issues, though, and can be explained if you have some imagination. Admittedly, it is not entirely understandable why the man wants his wife back at all costs - and why he hauls out the big guns. The reactions of the woman, on the other hand, are too logical. After all, she has to put an end to the threat once and for all.
On a side note, some of the reviews with the lowest ratings are mostly based on the irrelevant fact that the evil guy is white and the good cop is black/the victim is female. If the gender or color of the characters are such a huge problem for these reactionary reviewers, then the best and most logic movie might not be able to satisfy them.
In conclusion, The Invisible Man is a highly entertaining film with a few weaknesses you can ignore."
441,"I wanted to like this. I love a good horror movie. I'll take a good scare over gore. (Gore can be useful if used correctly, which so few movies do.) This movie has some decent scares, and very little gore (barely any in my eyes, though others may see more), so I should really like it. But it's just decent. Not necessarily a bad thing, but nothing to rave about.I like the message. It's important to see an allegory of how women are treated just as much as Get Out was important in its themes. And Elizabeth Moss really inhabits the part. My issue is with the characters. They're either so thin that you can't imagine them existing when not on screen, or they make the strangest decisions that are so not in character. No real spoilers here because these are things you can determine just from the premise, but are we really supposed to believe that characters who got along so well suddenly turn on each other over a slight misunderstanding, or refuse to believe each other. And the main character has so many chances to back up her story, but she never shares them with anyone. That's Lame-Horror 101.In the end, I feel like I've watched an average horror movie. Not a bad one, but one that's just decent enough to provide a few jumps and a handful of smiles at its few clever moments. I don't feel like my time was wasted, but I won't be rewatching this one."
442,"To start, phenomenal acting by Elisabeth Moss, and all the actors. Great pace, great plot, great music, and really good suspense. A must see and not what you expect!"
443,Keeps you on the edge for most of its running time. Certain cliches could've been avoided. Elizabeth Moss is a good actress. I just don't like her a lot personally.Decent watch.
444,"Very predictable at times and very frustrating at others with some of the actions and logic in the show. You'll get pissed off at a multitude of the characters and feel these people are dumb as hell or just feel like it's a gaping logic hole in the plot. The main character does have her shining 2000 IQ moments though, which are attention grabbing and pleasantly rewarding.Despite all that, the movie is fantastically suspenseful and entertainingly tragic. The acting was pretty solid and the cinematography and effects as well. My girlfriend and I were sufficiently spooked after so that's an 8/10 for me. Great blend of thriller and horror in my opinion.Don't get too lost in the sauce outthinking the plot and you're bound to have an excellent movie experience... or do like I did and be thankful you will still have a great time!"
445,"The Invisible Man (2020) is either a stalker's dream fantasy that ends badly (he dies) or an abused wife's nightmare that finally ends by getting revenge (the happy ending?). A simplistic plot already done dozens of times but with high tech eye candy and loads of bloody violence tossed in to gloss over a sophomoric ""plot."" Either way, the movie left me sad and empty because someone should have done worthwhile with the plot. Some people may like a simple good vs bad bloody revenge movie so enjoy, but I'm looking for good old hubris as used in previous Invisible Man versions. What should have been done was make everyone a ""dirty shirt in the drawer."" Make the scientist an average guy who has an invisible technology that is his ""ship"" finally coming in after years of solitary work. Surround him with a perfidious wife, covert Government agencies, and duplicitous business partners who want to take the money and run. Have the scientist use a small version (mini drones) of his invisibility technology to discover he's being screwed on all fronts and decides he going to win. The scientist builds an invisibility suit and killer drones on his own dime and starts to get even, spy, and make money dishonestly (goes from being a lamb into a lion). Toss in a true friend who warns of hubris. In the end everyone gets his or her comeuppance and everyone loses due to hubris, greed, and not being honest. The ""winners"" end up being the world because the invisibility technology is leaked, but quickly realize everything will now end up worse because nothing is now secret or secure. The world lapses into chaos. That is an Invisible Man movie."
446,"Was extremely excited for this. The director has never been interested in exposition, so i knew what to expect, but this was extreme. I had no idea what anyone's relationship to each other was supposed to be. The story is actually set up ok, the script is lazy, acting is fine. Go watch Upgrade it's good"
447,Too many moments to count where I was frustrated. That feeling you get when you try to tell your wife something and she doesn't listen.Could not wait for it to end.
448,"This movie feels like it was written by a 10 year old, not to mention the amateur special effects that went in to it. How this got such a good rating is beyond me"
449,It's good because the invisible man is not what you think it is.
450,"It is billed as a horror flick but it is really a thriller. It has lots of long build ups, supposedly to build tension but I found myself wanting to fast forward. I think because it was a science fiction based terror, it didn't echo in my own fears, which I think needs to be part of the recipe for audience buy in. I give this a 6 (fair) out of 10. {Thriller}"
451,"Beware if you're a victim of domestic abuse!! Personally, the ""horror"" & ""thriller"" aspects of this movie were mostly pertaining to the horror of having been a victim in a similar situation as the main character, Cecelia, gore aside. I do not recommend this movie if you are currently in an abusive relationship, or if you're still in the beginning stages of healing.
I gave a 7-star rating trying to be objective as an avid movie watcher."
452,"Wow where to start bad, idiotic, weak and implausible plot even as a scifi.
There is no balance or fluidity, acting does little other than make you uneasy.
The actors can barely keep it together long enough to convey the plot.
Bad camera work makes for constant closeups of ugly people making weird faces.
If this is a remake of the 50 scifantasy it is a tragedy more so the 33 wells classic.
I would not watch this again and whoever rated this a 7 must seen a different movie."
453,"E Moss was clearly casted as a known repressed woman from the Handsmaid Tale, but doesnt pull it of in this slow, dull and not at all suspensful watered down hollow man copy.
Cecilia is actualy the only character of interest, still it's shallow and dull.
If it werent for my smartphone being at hand, i'd probably fell asleep"
454,This is a movie with an interesting premise and a great role of actors that just doesn't quite use what its been given effectively. This isnt a movie I would I would call bad or even dislike it just feels like wasted potential. This movie has really great scenes with great cinematography and great acting and the plot for the most part keeps you fairly engaged and involved with the characters until the end portion of the movie where everything falls really short. This more down to earth plot about someone who's dealing with the main conflict in a very realistic way is broken due to very over the top scenes and turns the plot makes to make the movie feel corny. This mixed in with a couple scenes in the middle that had me scratching my head makes this a movie I will most likely forgot. Not to say I didn't enjoy a good chunk of it.
455,"The film completely relies on the language of the lens to show the fear that women dominated by male-dominated society. Cecilia had been neurotic in the first half, but was lonely in the second half. This loneliness makes one reflect on oneself: whether oneself has also become the abuser of the mental crush."
456,"The ambience is really good in this movie. I really liked it how they managed to make me feel afraid when ""The invisible man"" is around the main character.
You should definitely watch this movie, until you see the ending."
457,"The movie is Good
The thriller atmosphere is great in 2/3 parts of the movie
The end could be more surprising or tense.
In the end worth watching but not a masterpiece"
458,"The film a a bit ""formula"", and reminiscent of other ""abused woman stalked by possessive man"" films I've seen before. But the crafting is great, Elizabeth Moss is excellent in her role. And while the ending was predictable, I still thought the film was very suspenseful and a lot of fun! 8 stars may be overdoing it a bit, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it!"
459,Nice background music. This movie length was too long. I think if this length was 1:30-1:45 hours that's better for audience's....
460,Was okay most scenes were to dark to see much the story line is confusing
461,"After the last lamentable version of this concept with Kevin Bacon, I rightly wasn't anticipating anything particularly engrossing.
And the escape scene does seem to be a bit of a rip-off from 'Sleeping With The Enemy'.
After that though - the dialogue fires up, the characters come alive and the movie starts to churn around Elizabeth Moss's increasing disbelief and confusion, as ""something"" appears to alter her reality at a whim.
The early silent camera work is superb. You'll need to watch several scenes more than once to spot what's really happened, but don't spoil that on the first run-through.
Then there are the split-second pure jaw-dropping WTF moments you just didn't see coming.
Right up to the credits.
Cracking (largely unknown) cast, great script, fabulous camera work and a movie you simply will not forget in a hurry.WELL worth a watch."
462,"The past few years or so, any horror movie I've watched in theaters just didn't do it for me. Never heart racing, gripping the armrest, just waiting in total suspense type feelings. This movie got that part right.There are holes to the story and I won't pick it apart since, for me, it does work overall. But when the suspense picks up, it really picks up. You can never know where he is gonna pop up and the movie plays on that quite well. I mean, he's invisible.I read a lot of reviews that try and pin this as a feminist Hollywood placating everyone SJW type of trope film and I just don't see it. It's an abused woman up against a genuinely bad man. There's no girl power message behind it. No ""all men are bad"" sentiment that seems to be forced into some of these reviews. Don't let those scare you away.Of course, and as with many films, the ending is problematic. It leaves an air of mystery, yes, but almost too much. The main subject of the film - the case of who is doing this, why, and can we stop him? - isn't fleshed out enough to be satisfying. A good enough answer just isn't there. It's okay to have an open ending but the movie barely gives us any kind of solid answer to one of those questions.But... Since this movie got my heart rate up and had a decent enough story, I can rate it higher than most scary movies Hollywood has produced as of late."
463,How are James and Sydney related to Cecilia? Who was taking care of the dog? Slow start. Eh
464,"This is one of those mystery movies where most of the movie you don't know what exactly is happening and what's truth and what's not. The mystery is really good. Later in the movie you get more answers, but they are kinda logical, which is great. I recommend watching it.The budget was only 7 million, and it's amazing how good the movie is. Great cinematography, CGI and really good acting.It is kinda questionable that a millionaire guy would be with a woman who is not particularly beautiful, but he really must have had feelings for her."
465,"This was a great movie overall but I have no idea why it was R. Their was blood when he killed the sisters and other people, but I didn't think it was an R rated type of gore. Their was no sex and nudity, and the profanity was not bad at all.but over all it was good but if your trying to watch a SCARY movie don't watch this one."
466,"The acting, storyline, special effects, casting, I loved every second, I loved the Sci-fi and Thriller vibes combined.
The use of technology to stalk your wife, that right there is an interesting concept in itself, the mental instability of this man drove him to use his own technology to potentially trap and ruin his wife's life, her sister died in the process and that was unexpected.
Overall it was an amazing film."
467,"At the beginning, there is no direct picture of the heroine being hurt by her boyfriend's violence, but the sense of depression and suffocation has been everywhere, followed by the invisible fear, making use of misunderstanding to create the prejudice of the people around, trying to put the heroine on an island, making her lose confidence and return to the predicament."
468,Very easy to guess what is going to happen. Not a very big plot. Ok to watch....good action.
469,Starts off in the middle of not knowing what the hell is going on and no character building. Doesn't explain an unusual friendship. Then becomes so predictable. The acting was great. But the story line left me bored.
470,"Highs and lows of the movie were all over the place. No flow, scene didn't felt connected. Confusing plot. Many plot holes. Not 7 star worthy. With 7 star movies you feel a certain connection with it, this doesn't connects. You get confused about what you get from it.Have some amazing camera work, still they don't feel like part of it."
471,"So this guy makes a genius suit that can make himself invisible. He goes to the enormous effort of faking his own death. He could do anything now. But he devotes ALL his time to stalking his former wife. Surely he's got something better to do? Nope.Damn someone fakes their death, upends his entire life. Just to stalk his wife? Kinda weird. It would make more sense if he had something else on the boil as well.My other problem is that nobody notices that someone is still living in his house. The lights are on. Somebody's feeding the dog. But nobody notices? And why doesn't the protagonist simply tell people to investigate his house? Instead she's telling everyone he's invisible and naturally they think she's bonkers."
472,"Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) escapes a wealthy scientist in the dead of night hiding from a controlling relationship. The abusive ex suddenly dies and Cecilia believes his death is a hoax. Lives become threatened by lethal coincidences . Cecilia begins to unravel thinking she is being stalked by someone nobody can see.Some real good FX, but story logic is missing. Personally wasn't impressed with Moss as the lead; also appearing are Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Harriet Dryer, Aldis Hodge and Michael Dorman."
473,"This movie is a nice different take on the invisible man. The story was interesting and the acting good. i gave it 7 due to some serious plot holes, at least for me. The writing for the main character was a little lack. A woman being stalked and has evidence of being stalked normally would not be touching that evidence. The writers could have done better with some of the details."
474,Not as bad as everyone is making it on here. I was intrigued for most of the movie. It could have been so much better and so much more worse. Wish there were more jumps and it has ended better but not terrible.
475,"There were some goofs in production and a small hole in the storyline, but the concept was unique and well-executed. You're asking questions the whole time, which is good for this kind of movie. The ending was very satisfying too. I enjoyed it."
476,"A good movie and not a time wasted and that suit is actually so logically seems good to believe i dont wanna say more but just one thing ""its a good movie after all""."
477,"The concept of the ""invisible man"" movies have been around since the classic 1933 film by the same name. That classic film staring Claude Rains and Gloria Stuart set the stage for many good and great spin offs. The 2020 version does not disappoint either. This tail of betrayal, stocking and survival is a thrilling, edge of your seat roller-coaster.Though I was able to see the end coming, most people may not. It is worth watching from start to finish. As a lover of action movies, even the slow parts of this film (sometimes leaning more to Drama than its Horror/Mystery/Sci-Fi tag) kept me watching. It is definitely worth a view."
478,"Great sense of pending dread. Great visuals and effects and the Moss is excellent.
Despite the classic thriller tropes I didn't know where this was heading (which I love).
Worth a watch!"
479,"What worked:
tension building and balanced storygreat camera work and background scoreclever conclusionWhat did not work:
somewhat predictable at timesthe story isn't new to manyFinal verdict:
Recommended. The movie was actually surprisingly good, maybe it's because I hadn't kept high expectations."
480,"Elisabeth Moss as ever performs fantastic. I am very critical concerning movies and the last years I have see view that I really liked.
This film that kept me soanning from the beginning until the end. Great Movie!"
481,"Intriguing, a thriller that kept me entartained. The screenplay is a bit tacky in some scenes and the story couldve been more even distributed in the scenes. Other than that, enjoyed it!"
482,"This movie subverted a lot of my expectations as it follows similar beats to a much older film called 100 Feet. Much like that movie the title sets a different expectation than what the movie ultimately starts out as.If you seen a lot of movies, then you will eventually be able to predict the outcomes and even certain events before they happen. Its called cliche and generally is mark of generic or uninspired writing. This movie tends to leads you along to make your assumptions and then subverts them and then subverts them again. The Invisible Man, in all its iterations has always been about scifi horror about science gone wrong. This movie starts as a domestic abuse masquarding as a supernatural horror till it flips and does it well enough to keep you engaged and invested in the ensuing plight of the main character.So kudos to this movie that made me think it will be just another glorified horror movie and smacking me upside the head for thinking so and smaking me upside the head for getting smacked upside the head in the first place. Now that's a movie!"
483,"I have been rooting for the Universal Monsters franchise to get the reinvigoration that it's desperately needed for some time. As much as I've enjoyed movies like Dracula Untold and The Mummy (2017), clearly there was something about those movies that didn't click as far as attempts at kickstarting a franchise is concerned. With The Invisible Man, from Blumhouse and directed by Leigh Whannell, I hoped that it was a sign of Universal taking a more humble approach and letting said movie be a movie focused on telling a thrilling & good story that's not trying to set up a cinematic universe (an approach that allowed many of the Universal Monsters films to be regarded as classics in the 1st place). And, I must say that The Invisible Man (2020) was a really, really good, perhaps even great, sci-fi thriller. So, now, let's get into why it's so good.First, a plot synopsis: The film focuses on Cecilia Kass, who left her abusive boyfriend Adrian Griffin. After finding out he died, she tries to move on, but then she starts noticing some very unusual things which lead her to think that Griffin has found a way to torment her using invisibility.There's a lot that I can praise this movie for, but we'll start with the acting. The acting in the film is very good as a whole, but Elisabeth Moss, as Cecilia, is the one who commands the screen; she does an excellent job at conveying the emotions of a woman who has gone through Hell and whose life is just about to get worse, and it makes the viewer feel for her and root for her in her struggle.The film also has great direction going on from Leigh Whannell, who has proven himself since Upgrade, the 2018 film, that he is a name worth looking out for. He's definitely taken pointers for his film from his fellow filmmaker, James Wan, whom he collaborated with for several past films that Wan made, and I can say that Whannell has certainly refined his skills to a substantial degree. There are several scenes that involve great cinematography, from the setting of Griffin's estate to scenes where Kass is looking out for any signs of Griffin, as the titular Invisible Man, possibly being in the same room as her. Another scene worth noting is when the Invisible Man is fighting & killing a bunch of people in a hallway, which provides some hard-hitting action and some brutal, bloody kills.There's also plenty of suspense going on as the film keeps you guessing on whether the Invisible Man is in the same room as Cecilia or what he was gonna do and when, which would lead to some well-executed scares, some intense scenes of Kass confronting the Invisible Man, and even scenes that are surprising (I can say that there were a couple moments that totally caught me off guard when I saw it in the theater).The story is also a well-told & compelling tale about what a manipulative & abusive relationship could do to a person and the film tells this story in a way that doesn't feel pandering but rather in a way where anyone, no matter what gender, could relate. I can also say that the film has plenty of surprises, that I don't want to spoil because the marketing for the film actually keep a lot in secret for people to see cold and I want people to go in the same; I was worried that the trailers had given away more than necessary, but I was wrong and I couldn't be happier about being wrong.If there's anything that I could say that isn't so much a negative as it is something that's kinda iffy/questionable, I would say that there are a couple of moments in the film that make me question how the Invisible Man got to certain places as well as how one scene, despite being still an effective scene, raises a question about whether or not there are security cameras in the room that could somewhat raise people's eyebrows about a certain event that went down in said scene.When it's all said and done, I can say that The Invisible Man (2020) was one of the best horror reboots that I've seen in a while; it's certainly the best modern reiteration of a Universal Monster to come out by far. While perhaps not perfect, it's suspenseful to a nail-biting degree, it's expertly-directed, Elisabeth Moss is fantastic, and the story was very engaging from beginning to end. And, the best part about this film's quality, as well as its financial success, is that it has given me hope that the Universal Monsters franchise may finally have received the reinvigoration it's needed for modern times, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing what Blumhouse does with this franchise in the future."
484,"This weekend the first ever major studio movie; Universal Films The Invisible Man, was released direct to the consumer by way of video on demand, after movie theaters were shuttered along with everything else in the country due to the Covid-19 pandemic, became available to download at a cost of $19.99 for 3 viewings over a 48 hour period.The steeply priced VOD may have turned some would-be viewers away as the, at-home versus in-theater value has not yet caught on fully. I decided to take the plunge and rent the film to help you decide for yourself if you'd like to also participate.The Invisible Man stars Elisabeth Moss; head of Hulu's smash hit, The Handmaid's Tale, as Cecilia the victimized wife of optics genius Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) whom a la #metoo, valiantly decides to take her life back by leaving her abusive husband after drugging him in the middle of the night.As Cecilia hides out of sight with her friend James (Aldis Hodge) and James' teenage daughter Sydney (Storm Reid), strange occurrences begin to happen forcing Cecilia into a state of panic. Questioned at first and then shut out by her sister and best friend, Emily (Harriet Dyer), Cecelia takes a hardcore ride into the mouth of madness.As bizarre occurrences escalates, those who once believed in Cecelia's sanity diminishes in beautifully crafted suspense and friction by mastermind director Leigh Whannell; suspense which is reminiscent of the Great Depression noirs, with their Hitchcockian vibe and slow burn to frantic climax.The Invisible Man will be a favorite of cross genre fans including seekers of the thriller and suspense experience but will also appeal to the horror film base. For those of you who are keen on a drama, The Invisible Man will tickle your fancy with its strong backstory brought front and center-as long as you don't mind some edge of your seat, nail biting.So grab the folks you're quarantined with and pop the corn. You deserve a break from the worrisome pandemic. And remember-it could be worse; an invisible man could be stalking you while you're quarantined during a pandemic.Again, the first ever major studio movie to be released direct to the consumer after movie theaters were shuttered along with everything else in the country due to the Covid-19 pandemic, is available to download at a cost of-a very enjoyable 2 hour reprieve from pandemic life."
485,Elizabeth Moss plays her role well as the protagonist of the movie! You don't know what to expect and the movie ends on a rather satisfying note.Don't know if this is Leigh Whannels' directorial debut but an amazing job nonetheless! For a modern day horror/thriller to score 91% on the Tomatometer at the time of this review is amazing! A must see!
486,Exactly what I expected. Good thriller; starts off great ends up great. I love Leigh whannell and I think his reimagining of the invisible man was a perfect anxiety-driven stalker film.
487,"The Invisible Man is a tension-filled, really well crafted thrill ride. It is filled with moments that will make you clench in your seat while watching it. Elizabeth Moss is really great here as she shows a lot of emotions throughout the course of the runtime. It is also very well directed by Leigh Whannell as he masters the true sense of horror through images and relies more on tension rather than a jumpscare fest. The film can get a but ridiculous at times, but it is saved by Elizabeth Moss' truly great performance and Leigh Whannell's steady eyes for the camera. One of the stand outs of 2020 so far.RATING: 8/10"
488,"A feast for the eyes and soul. Great performances and powerful emotions appear in this blumhouse goodie. Elizabeth Moss was excellent, it seems almost impossible to not relate to her character. But I most of all enjoyed the score. Great film, would recommend."
489,Way better than I expected which was a pleasant surprise. If you're on the fence about watching it or not I'd recommend you give it a chance.
490,"I liked the direction, the setting, the dark-ish aesthetics, the cat was very good, everything came naturally.
I wasn't a big fan of the plot, but it surprised me in a positive way, because I was expecting something idfferent.
Some part didn't make sense, like the simplicity of the invention, the fact that she hides her uniform in the bathroom, he gets in there, sees the uniform, yet he doesn't suspect anything the last time he sees her. Unless it was the brother that entered the bathroom while she was at their house.
I don't understand how she went to his house after all this without being scared? How they both pretended to have a civilised dinner?
The way he easily manipulated her sister with the email, the sister was angry, yet accepted to have dinner with her..too easy."
491,"Overall a good movie with suspense. I think it would be better if it was about an 1.30 hour movie.
Also ... Elisabeth was the right person 4 this role.
Watch it."
492,"Whats with all the hate for this film ....? i actually fort it was a good enjoyable thriller with a good few eeek didnt see that coming moments , like i said in my discription its all been done before but dont let that put you off just enjoy , for me it s defo worth 7/10 ."
493,I haven't seen such an exciting movie in a long time.
494,"I liked the fact the movie had, fear, anxiety, thriller, mystery, suspense. Not gory, rapey, etc. It's starts a little slow to build up the story. You think you can predict what happens but the part I didn't like is your getting anxiety from her not doing much at first. Lol Their is abuse so you might not like that part.
Overall loved it had a fantastic ending. Despite all the bad reviews.
I didn't give it a higher rating because I found myself trying to tell her why isn't she doing more in struggles. Lol"
495,"Relying entirely on camera language, the film gives vent to the fears that a male-dominated society imposes on women.The actress's superb acting is very impressive.On the basis of the classic horror setting, add more life, more real elements, let you find that such terrorist events, in fact, have been happening around us."
496,"Wow. With people writing either that this movie is a masterpiece or the worst thing imaginable, I had to write a review. First in many years!This film was a good flick. Was it a classic? No. Was it atrocious? No way. Like every single film, there are things that could have been done better. But the film moved, it was ""slow"" and some people are saying. it was not a ""blow it up and make 2020 ""like"" stupid quick satisfaction"" film Elizabeth Moss was very believable in the film. She did a good job in the role. Is she the world's most beautiful? No. But it's not like she is a piece of trash either. The film had some situations that were ""predictable"" for sure. That is expected in almost every film out there. But the film was not like so many of the reviewers are saying. Get this: at 48 minutes I thought: ""if this situation"" (which was with Elizabeth Moss and the young actress playing the daughter getting slapped) is what is going to happen in the rest of the film, I was prepared to ""hate the film""...but it did not continue and I did not hate the film, although from some of the atrocious reviews, I was thinking so. So glad we continued to watch. Don't get me wrong - this is not a classic film but it is in no way a piece of trash or 1 star movie like some of these ""paid haters"" are portraying it. It's ""fake news"" and you no what to do with that.....go with your gut and don't believe the stuff that people who must hate Elizabeth Moss have to say."
497,"Good, fast story, kept my attention to the end, that's the main thing important to me.
does it have ""holes""? couldn't care less if it's interesting.
very recommended"
498,"I expected more thriller in it, seems to me its kind of an obvious plot.. Interesting concept though"
499,"When I was a child and teenager growing up and coming home from school my genuine objective each night was to find a good film to watch in order to fill the void of monotony on a school night, with the next early morning school day ever lurking. During this unprecedented and and certainly unorthodox period of quarantine from COVID-19, it seems I have dug back into my roots of indulgence in cinema as a means of an easier existence. I knew little about Leigh Whannell's, The Invisible Man (2020) other than it seemed like a cheap simulacrum from Kevin Bacon's 'Hollow Man (2000), and also that it starred Elizabeth Moss, the latter proving more enticing however not overall encapsulating, but then again that is the problem with assumptions.But WOW! And I mean that with utmost enthusiasm, this film provided a riveting, jaw-dropping and side-winding experience of deceit, manipulation and disturbia. To summarise the sci-fi horror plot, Cecilia Kass (Moss), is entrapped in an abusive relationship of which she narrowly escapes within the first scene - her husband Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) is a controlling and manipulative boyfriend. He is also the creator of an optics company and it is understood throughout that he is very successful at what he does, both in controlling people and inventing new technologies. After Cecilia escapes, Adrian fakes his own death and uses a suit which turns him invisible in order to haunt her with his memory, amongst other stomach-curdling things which you will have to watch to find out - it really takes Samuel Jackson's character (Frozone) in 'The Incredibles' notorious exclamation of 'Honey! Where's my supersuit!?' to a whole new level.This film plays very much on a sort of 'invisible enemy' motif, establishing ideas surrounding domestic abuse with an extension of PTSD following our main protagonist Cecilia, quite literally. The film transcribes very much the ideas of vulnerability of women and extends it into the outer world of societal perception, both figuratively and literally. The fact that Cecilia has experienced such abuse and then starts to realise that Adrian is not dead, yet still torturing her with various methods, such as loosening her tethers with others which is done methodically in order to exacerbate her anguish and serves to portray real life problems which mirror the science-fiction narrative of the film. That females, and males included, do unfortunately succumb to domestic abuse and this can have an adverse effect on them mentally, however for our protagonist it is both mentally and physically.When Cecilia resumes back into everyday normal life without Adrian she seems instantly vulnerable and at the worlds mercy. Although, we learn that Adrian has apparently committed suicide and this allows Cecilia to begin to reintegrate back into normality, supposedly. However, her safe haven is cut short when she begins to realise Adrian's not dead and instead using his invisibility suit in order to terrorise her. The proceedings are rhapsodic, unbelievable and shocking throughout as some of the scenes and things that Adrian does in order to destroy Cecilia's life prove almost unwatchable, literally, multiple scenes I was grasping my mouth in horror. I do believe after seeing this, that what victims of such acts have to endure is a loss of control over their everyday life, which proves as demeaning as the acts which the antagonist pursues.This is achieved in a multitude of ways, of which the films cinematographer crew and camera men have worked extravagantly, again wow. From privileged spectator position shots, POV's bouncing between protagonist and antagonist, de-centralised shots to accumulated a sense of suspicion, such as staring into a space and away from the key signifiers of the scene whilst zooming slowly and ominously, again establishing a 'invisible enemy' and is once again off-putting, when Cecilia knows Adrian is present all work very well and serve purpose throughout. The music is also inviting, adding a disturbing nature, and used to build anticipation - the anticipation often drawn out to gain maximum effect which proves more beneficial than any jump scare I've ever seen.The characters are also all so diverse and brilliantly portrayed. Moss wouldn't have had her work cut out for her due to her involvement in the dehumanising role of 'The Handmaid's Tale', where again she is subordinate, however the range of personalities is small but fulfilling, with a charismatic father and daughter taking Cecila in, a stern sister and Adrian's brother of whom if he told me the sky was blue outside I'd go out and check. I suppose the healthy relationship of the father James (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid) earns a sort of contrast from that of the fragmented/broken relationship Cecilia experienced, and their involvement throughout creates a gut-wrenching foreshadowment which incurs worry surrounding their fate when Adrian is involved. As for Adrian, his dialogue is limited and really established the idea of the 'invisible enemy' well, just like how the alien from Super 8 is shown very little, the little he has to say only enhances his actions, whilst creating the suspense for whenever Cecilia believes he is present. There are twists in the plot throughout so don't think you will have everything sussed out before the end, however the end does invite a really interpretation of the film as a whole and what has just happened.Whilst, everything I have said thus far has shed light on a pretty terrific and differentiated science-fiction film, issues do come to light throughout unfortunately. The main for me I think is that I just don't really understand the whole agenda of Adrian, things do come to light later in the film which portray him as a and I quote 'narcissistic sociopath' however, faking his own suicide just to haunt a girlfriend who didn't want to be with him due to his own behaviour seems over-exaggerated. Again, things do come to light and there are a few things for you as a viewer to decipher upon viewing, which will make this review a lot more meaningful, as I do believe the twists and turns in the film are its gateway to authenticity, therefore I do wish to leave that ground untrodden. Moreover, a few gimics do become notable throughout such as Cecilia knowing Adrian's password to everything. I mean if he was that controlling the password to his invisible suit wouldn't be the day you guys met, I mean like come on we can't all be hackers, I know, but we can all have the self respect to not be that level of cringe! Cecilia only sometimes suspects someone lurking around her, and I mean if I was being haunted by an invisible man with evil intentions of destroying my life and hurting everyone around me I'd be flailing my arms like an Octopus turned sushi chef, but Cecilia doesn't seem to ascertain the same survival techniques as me, that or she just hasn't seen as many Kevin Bacon movies as me *cough* Hollow Man *cough*.To conclude, and to reiterate my first point, 'The Invisible Man' did fill my night with a very entertaining and enthralling watch, and as I do joke about Hollow Man, it isn't nearly as well executed as The Invisible Man. The undertones are fun to decipher, even in their macabre nature, the acting is stellar especially from Moss. However the sister, although a stern lawyer, can seem a little lifeless and unconcerned. The camera angles and filming however do steal the show for me from all aspects, and the lighting especially within the scene in the loft is immersive. The music is great as well and does its job. Apart from the problems established, I really rate this as a breathe of fresh air in the sci-fi horror genre, intertwining a societal issues of domestic abuse with a sci-fi villain you can't see is overall understandably intriguing."
500,"This film start with a woman ""Cecilia"" running away from her husband ""Adrian"", her sister ""Emily"" drive her away to save her scene! As turnout, this film is about Adrian invented an invisible suit to make himself disappear to haunting Cecilia, and make Cecilia back to his side again! Entire film too freaking slow, and full of boring conversation! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, the invisible man killing a bunch of cops at the hospital! At the end, Cecilia refuse to get back with Adrian! She fail to prove Adrian guilty by persuasion, and she eventually kill Adrian by wearing the invisible suit to make Adrian look like commit suicide! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
501,"There's a lot to like about this movie and not much to dislike.The sound effects and building of suspense was so good, and it didn't ever become boring, which I hate. The attic/staircase part actually scared the crap out of me. I honestly haven't been that scared since a kid, at least from a movie. Elisabeth Moss does a great job acting, so you never see a lot of these good parts coming, also.Even the ladder thing at Christmas was cool (not trying to give too much away if anyone hasn't seen it).I can't see how anyone wouldn't like this movie."
502,"Summation: are you gonna pull the taffy or eat the taffy?Long, drawn out nonsense"
503,"Would have been a great horror flick if not for soo many plot holes and I've always found Elizabeth Moss's acting a little awkward and stiff and this is no exception. I would have preferred a fresh face in the role, as with too many films that cast stereotypical actors"
504,"Darkly crafted, and often stunning, The Invisible Man more than deserves its fresh take on its source material, and makes for quite a unique film experience. The cinematography is one of the most unique things about the film, truly creating a grippingly tight atmosphere that allows for the feel of tension it is going for. At times the film can prove to be somewhat predictable and it does take a bit of a push to start going, but by the end you are more than entertained by the ride of thrills it packs in, and it does them almost masterfully. Elisabeth Moss is the obvious standout in the film, providing some truly excellent acting, and some greatly performed dialogue that is truly some of the best I have seen from her and from a horror film in a little while. Leigh Whannell truly directs the film with such a unique sense of vision, I can't help but feel more appreciate for his earlier work, and for what he decides to do in the future. In the end, The Invisible Man does have some issues with pacing in the first act and is at times predictable, but when it needs to be, The Invisible Man is a thrill ride like no other, with some truly excellent acting from Moss, and a quite unique sense of vision on a classic tale.
My Rating: 9/10"
505,"The Invisible Man (4.5 out of 5 stars).The Invisible Man is a really good science fiction horror film that is a reboot from the original classic monster films. But with Leigh Whannell's direction and script which grounded the character and using serious themes about toxic relationships and abuse. And throwing the fear that someone may be watching you and no one believing you. That is where the film goes. Following Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) who is escaping from an abusive relationship with scientist Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). The opening intense sequence with Cecilia escaping over night. And the idea of Adrian chasing her down. Weeks later, Cecilia is staying with her friend James (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). When she finds out Adrian committed suicide. Having difficulties believing it. She begins to feel like she is being watched by him still. When her life is turned upside down with no one believing her and having trouble trying to prove that he is still alive. When she begins to feel like he found a way to be invisible.The plot is good. Whannell uses the concept of an abusive relationship and how it can take a strong toll on someone. Like Cecilia, when she is afraid for weeks that he is still out there. She can barely walk outside the house without a jogger setting her off. That fear alone and adding her abusive ex stalking her and being invisible. Which takes the obsessiveness to a whole new level when someone can watch someone for a long time in a house. There is a couple of plot twists which is surprising and thrilling. Leigh Whannell tends to add a twist to all his movie scripts. The script and direction is sharp, smart, and has a lot of fun building intensity. The direction of having lots of cinematography being still as Cecilia is walking in a room. While watching for details if the invisible character is there or not. By watching items move or sound.The film does have a few intense scenes with Cecilia being attacked and thrown around. Which her friend James has trouble believing her or if it is all in Cecilia's head. The music score is good. The sound of Cecilia coming across someone is suspenseful. The cinematography shots are well placed. The plot is good. The film did have a little slow story building.Overall, The Invisible Man is a really good horror film. It has a few scares. I did feel like it did lack in jump scares. The film is suspenseful, thrilling, and performances by Elisabeth Moss is great."
506,"This movie is SLOW BORING STUPID!
The lead actress, ""bless her heart,"" is the most unattractive actress you can imagine.
There is NO reason at all to watch this."
507,"Ok to the point, Whatever her name is Moss, is one of the worst actresses and why they cast her in anything is beyond me. I never seen her series with women i. Red clothes and what seems to be a show about women being used for making babies and probably a man hating show .So basically I come to relise that the only way this movie is getting High reviews is from other Females aka feminists aka man haters. And just give it a good review well, just because. If the movie sucks , say it sucks. Which this movie is huge at sucking. I couldn't finish it, and that will make 4 movies In my life I made half way through and said. ""Ya not even gunna finish"" the moss chick is just semi popular so they used her. And I want to say much more about her but I am refraining from doing so as I was taught if you don't have anything nice to say then say nothing at all. So......."
508,"This movie is more than amazing. The plot is extraordinary, the acting to the point and some jump scares are so effective. You see them coming but they still affect you. The setting and storyline also make it a top-rated five-star movie."
509,"The movie becomes so stupid at some point i could not watch it anymore. I regretted downloading the torrent and wasting 1 hr + before turning it off.
Am not sure anymore if movies are intentionally stupid in order to attach on the broader audience or the makers are really dumb and lazy."
510,"Was Intense from the moment it began... My palms were sweating and I didn't know what to expect from one moment til the next!
I hadn't read a review or watched a trailer so was expecting a surprise..
Freaking loved it!"
511,"I thought the build up was fantastic and waited eagerly for the thrill ride but it never came, the movie ended building up to an amazing movie that was never made. I had more fun watching the trailer, scenes from which by the way was not included in the movie."
512,"I was expecting to be bad movie , but it was more worser that I think."
513,Forget about the rules of physics and chemistry go grab a popcorn and enjoy the bloody movie with the family on edge of your seats !!
514,"A. I love horror B. I NEVER walk out of movies
But I WALKED OUT of this movie theater.
There was a scene where a cerebral, nerdy character actually kills a good 10 police officers all charging at him. He's not even fully invisible in this scene! This nerdy guy goes one by one and kills each cop. I cant even begin to explain the reasoning I would have to suspend for this scene to make any sense. This is also one of MANY scenes where something like blood should be floating mid air obviously indicating part of the form of a man, but the movie just, doesn't. It's not even suspenseful at this level of dis-logic because you're suspending all knowledge of physics, human nature, etc. that made it suspenseful to start. I don't care if there's some huge twist in the end that makes it all make sense. I don't care if it's actually someone else becoming invisible. I don't care if it's a robot! It makes NO sense. Even a trained cop wouldn't be able to take down 10 police officers, with or without invisibility. It's a horror movie, and they introduce Michael Myers, and then gave him super strength and invulnerability."
515,It's not acceptable in 2020 to have a movie with so many plot holes and some many logical flaws.
516,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA wtf? Turns into a movie for 15 year old girls in the last 15 minutes. Could have been better of course but you gotta ride the new wave for some extra cash I guess, SAD."
517,"I love a good horror but this snooze fest shouldn't even have the honor of being labeled a ""horror."" It was so bad that I actually fell asleep!"
518,To dark I can't see some scenes it reminds me of game of thrones
519,"No spoilers. Hard to believe this has a score of 7.5. It could have been a decent movie. Good acting all around, but so many obvious plot flaws I lost count."
520,"I was very excited when i saw the trailer of this movie, yesterday i wen to the cinema to watch it. The storyline is so bad it was so awfull to watch actually i was planning on leaving earlier. I didnt gave up and there was not a single moment in the movie it got better."
521,"Script to score this was a complete waste of time. Zero backstory to make the audience care about any of the characters, each plot point is more absurd than the last. Please save your money."
522,"The idea of an invisible man, exploited in several other movies and series, is so rich. You can do whatever you want with it. You can make the plot incredibly interesting.Unfortunately, this movie did none of it. In the first 30 minutes, nothing really happens. In the next 30 minutes there's maybe 2 interesting scenes. Seems the movie is more like a political pamphlet than a real movie.I could actually take this idea, write a better script, and film a better movie. And I have no experience as scriptwriter or movie director. But I'd have no problems outperforming this.I have no idea how did this movie get a pretty high rating, when it's realistic rating should be around 4.2 or lower. Can't recommend it even if they offer it for free. Two hours of complete boredom."
523,"The Invisible Man is another movie made for todays 'woke' culture with more political correctness that Hollywood feels they need to subject us to.The characters in the film are incredibly weak and the protagonist is yet another victim of an evil male. Her motivation is poor (to say the least) and her character arc is virtually nonexistent. This type of film is nothing new to mainstream Hollywood films, but here is the fresh take offered in this film - the villain is evil simply because he is a man.We have to accept Cecilia's (Elisabeth Moss) word as to why her psychotic husband acts the way he does. But we are not meant to question her reliability. The clich√© evil-genius-psycho-guy angle is now a given. Plus, making him a round character with motivation would cut into valuable screen time for Cecelia to try and find interesting ways to see if her invisible stalker is in the room.Show don't tell is the unwritten rule in filmmaking, but we don't actually see Cecelia's husband do anything but give a menacing grin near the end. Then she murders him in cold blood. The ending is so bad that the audience is left to wonder if her husband was actually innocent, and if his brother was the one behind it all. This is not an open ending, just a bad one.Cecilia's buddy-cop friend is just about the worst detective ever. His covering up Cecilia's murder of her husband is horrid. I'm tired of watching films where cops break the law and bend the rules when their friends are involved, or if they feel the antagonist really deserved it. Do your job and uphold the law. He didn't do anything the entire film but paint his house, leave his friend unattended (after kicking her out of his home) and get beat up. Pretty weak for a detective.Watch the original 1933 version or go read the book by H.G. Wells, but don't waste your time on this film."
524,"Sorry but this film was so slow to begin with, I had lost all interest after 10 minutes!
I get the new premise & take yet it just didn't click for me.
There's just too much of the poor woman & abusive partner in films now & it's getting boring & repetitive.. The pacing was just way too slow for my liking but then I was expecting a different type of film. Heck, even if they flipped it so it was the other way around - that might have kept my interest for longer.Again, not for me yet I expect it will be enjoyable for many."
525,Why would invisible need to in the attic ?? üôÑüòÇüòÇ
526,"The story is really scary and really thrilling. It got my heart pounding most of the time! It is a tough watch, because I simply cannot imagine to be the victim of this constant abuse. Elizabeth Moss delivers a terrifying performance. I really recommend this film."
527,"A brilliant scientist, engineer, and businessman (Adrian) is extremely obsessed with an unattractive average woman who kills him in cold blood at the end of the movie and gets away with it. No morality. The obsession would be credible if the woman was Irina Shayk or the female version of Einstein. Whether Adrian and/or his brother Tom did the setup and killings is not clear. Three stars for the visual effects."
528,I am still wondering why I stayed until the end! I was probably hoping for some twist to make this movie interesting. That didn't happen. Don't make the same mistake. Choose something else to watch or do with your time.
529,"Poor acting, poor script and excessive amount of money to bring this dung to life, so to waste your two hours of free time. Watching the trailer says it all. There is nothing amazing about this movie other than how much disappointment it can leave you feeling with."
530,"No detailed background fo the character.
Who was the police?
How her sister came into picture?"
531,How does somebody wash off that much paint and dry off without a towel and without leaving a single drip of water in less than 3 minutes?
532,"There's nothing to take away from the performance of the cast. There were some negligible plot holes which didn't go unnoticed. The premise was great but the buildup did not suffice. My only squabble was with the ending,There's a contradiction between how they sequenced the characters and how they forced them to act in the end."
533,"There is a lot that doesn't make sense in this horror/mystery. But it completely lost me when an employer says this line: ""So any reason you worked in Paris in particular? Is that where all the beautiful women in the world have to go as a rule?"". Let's be honest here, Elisabeth Moss is as beautiful as much as Kevin Hart is tall. She is completely miscast here. The idea that a superrich man is dead crazy about, and obsessed about knocking up a 40 year old woman who is portrayed by Elisabeth Moss is completely nonsense. Besides that, the movie doesn't even try to convince us about this character's other traits (apart from her being 'beautiful'. Yeah right.). I mean seriously, what's so special about her? Why is she the centerpiece of this whole mess? All she does on this whole movie is acting crazy, scared and paranoid. The creators of the film probably figured out this paradox, and have included a scene where Moss's character actually wonders: ""Why me?"". Well, I have the same question."
534,"Great film. Very suspenseful throughout. Another prime example that what you dont see can be much scarier. The emotional and psychological breakdown of the main character was brilliant. Couple of fun twists as well. The dinner scene at the restaurant was a major surprise, really caught me off guard. Decent ending. Turned a somewhat cheesy and dated classic and turned it into a really good horror film."
535,Better than I expected. I would recommend it if you like suspenseful thrillers. Great lead acting!
536,"I attended a Denver Film Critic's screening of The Invisible Man this past Tuesday with another one of our writers. This was a low budget film of only 7M, but it was pretty damn good. The audience was engaged from the very first frame and Elizabeth Moss was magnificent in the lead role. This was not a re-boot of the original classic, but a completely unique film in a modern setting with state of the art technology incorporated with believable realism.This movie is getting very strong reviews from both professional critics and the general audience. There are minor flaws, but in the full scope of things these can be easily overlooked considered the entire body of work. Moss was superb, and the supporting cast did not let us down whatsoever. Adrian takes a place as one of the most evil villains in modern times.It's creepy, it's gut-wrenching and the audience is all in with the almost impossible situation that Cecilia is placed in. I mean, really? Who is going to believe that you are being stalked and tortured by an invisible man who is DEAD? Elizabeth Moss shows her despair, hopelessness, exasperation, but emerges with unbelievable conviction and strength to combat this unimaginable evil."
537,"I saw ""The Invisible Man"", starring Elisabeth Moss-The Handmaid's Tale_tv, The West Wing_tv; Oliver Jackson_Cohen-The haunting of Hill House_tv, Faster; Aldis Hodge-Jack Reacher:Never Go Back, A Good Day to Die Hard and Michael Dorman-Patriot_tv, Killer Elite_2011.
This is an attempt to reboot Universal Studios' 'Monster Universe' after the poor showing of 2017's The Mummy. I think that they did a pretty good job. Elisabeth plays a woman in a relationship with an abusive man, Oliver-both physically and mentally. He is a wealthy researcher in the field of experimental optics and controls everything Elisabeth does. Two weeks after she finally gets up enough courage to leave him, Oliver is found dead, of an apparent suicide. His brother Michael is the executor of the will, and Oliver leaves Elisabeth $5 million dollars, with a few stipulations. She can not commit a crime. And most importantly, she can not be found to be mentally insane. Elisabeth moved in with a friend, Aldis, when she left Oliver and strange things start to happen that causes Elisabeth to think that Oliver is not dead. And of course, no one else ever sees these strange things happening like Elisabeth does. Is Oliver back or is she going insane? There are several twists in the story that are engaging and surprising and a few nods to the original Invisible Man series.
It's rated ""R"" for bloody violence, drug use and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes.
I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
538,"When I saw the trailer for this I was instantly intrigued. Even more so when I saw the name of the film. The Dark Universe was a disaster. Dracula: Untold was so average that they tried to restart the franchise with 2017's The Mummy, which was straight awful. Alas, the Dark Universe as a shared universe died but I guess they decided to do standalone films instead. So based on past experiences, we should have had every inkling that this would be terrible. However this was a really good re-imagining/reboot that remains entertaining for the full runtime.
The film is about a woman who runs away from her husband because he is abusive. She finds out he commits suicide and 5 million dollars in his name could legally be acquired by her provided she does not conduct criminal activity and has a normal mental state. She soon becomes haunted by an invisible force, that not only terrorizes her but becomes dangerously violent. No one will believe her and she must find a way to not only protect herself but find out how this is happening. The film stars someone who I feel is one of the best actresses today: Elisabeth Moss.
Leigh Whannell honestly blew me away with the very impressive sci-fi thriller, Upgrade. That alone should be reason to watch The Invisible Man. This is a real horror thriller that is set up incredibly well. The camerawork and atmosphere created really complement the plot of the film and your eyes are glued to the screen, really trying to find out where this invisible man is at any given moment. The thrills are great and while the film goes through predictable stages it honestly takes the concept of the invisible man and creates something so wonderfully modern and unique and it really works.
I want to close off by talking about how good Elisabeth Moss is. I followed her growth as Peggy Olsen in Mad Men and knew of her talent right away. Her portrayal of a woman having a mental breakdown in Queen of Earth was amazing and she channels a similar type of energy for this. She is fantastic in this film as she is in pretty much everything she does. This was a strong reboot or re-imagining of a Universal classic. It takes liberties but all of it is done well and I think its about time Leigh Whannell started to blow up.
7.5/10"
539,"I was not expecting this to be that perfect even with all the critical acclaim its getting right now. But this was a roller coaster ride! It is a good psychological horror which makes this more watchable because it's not trying too hard to be scary with loud noises or corny jumpscares. And you feel bad for the protagonist (Elizabeth Moss) because she's been through so much trauma and is innocent the whole time and it makes you want other people in the movie to believe she's being tormented by an invisible force. There are a few jumpscares and loud noises but they work well with the atmosphere and they aren't overused constantly, they actually manage to have tension throughout this while using small bits of jumpscares. So far, this is the best horror movie of 2020"
540,"The invisible man
2020
15
Director: Leigh Wannel
Starring: Elisabeth Moss, Oliver Jackson cohen, Harriet Dyer, Aldis Hodge, Storm Reid etcOverall rating 88/100The invisible man is based on a character called Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) who escapes her abusive relationship with her partner. But after he kills himself and gives her all his money everything seems to be fine. But mysterious events are happening to Cecilia that leads her to believe he has found a way to stalk her but will anyone believe her? Wow what a fantastically crafted movie, easily the best horror of the year, so many fantastic components to talk about but let down slightly by one big thing, lets talk about this more.First of all the films cinematography and sound design was excellent. Wow this films cinematography was beyond excellently crafted. Whether it was the fantastic title sequence at the beginning. Or its excellent use normal day to day places and items becoming horrifying. It was simple things like blankets or chairs that were just so effective due to the invisible element to the movie fear of the unknown played a key element in the cinematography working so well. Also, the films sound design was phenomenal. The film had a great equal reliance on the visual elements, but more so the sound. Due to the obvious inviable element the films use of diegetic sound was fantastic. It really made you pay attention to each little sound trying to find where Adrian (Oliver Jackson Cohen) was. The films score was also fantastic in adding to the impact of a lot of scenes, but also the lack of sound or score also intensified the uncomfortable fear that this film managed to create.Adding on from my previous point the film managed to have an excellent tense tone and very well executed Jumpscares. Wow this film was perhaps the most tense I have ever been for a horror movie. They really played well into the fear of the unknown, and once again the use of invisibility really helped with the tenseness because you couldn't tell where he was so the film actively placed you into the shoes of the characters and their fear turned into your fear. And because of this fear of the unknown there was some excellently executed Jumpscares. Wow no predictable Jumpscares at all, they weren't overused, but used well enough to startle you on many occasions. There was often long pauses when you thought something was going to happen but it didn't and the minute you calmed down it made you jump, so the Invisible man really had excellently timed and crafted scares that genuinely took you by surprise.Next the film had effective uses of gore and a very entertaining final act. The films use of violence was also very effective. Due to the limited use of it, when it was used it genuinely took me by surprise and left a lot of the audience gasping, showing the film managed to achieve its desired reaction. Also the long mid close ups of the aftermath also added to the impact and allowed what just happened to sink in more. This all led to a very entertaining final act. When Elisabeth Mosses lured Adrian to the hospital she was staying it, despite the smaller budget they managed to achieve a very good final act action scene that was used effectively and was different to anything I have seen due to the added element of invisibility. The twists and plot twist were shocking and used effectively but not all were executed well as I am about to discuss.My only negative that ruined the film slightly was its ending and overcomplicated ending. They decided to add some mystery into the film that for me didn't quite stick with the ending. They added that it was not Adrian but her brother doing the tormenting. But us as the audience knew that Adrian was guilty, Elisabeth Mosses character then decided to kill Adrian, which for me made me dislike her character more, and the scene were this was revealed felt to quick and underdeveloped so the logic was slightly off, so this effected my overall opinion on the film slightly.My final positives that made the film really good was the likeable characters, great themes and messages about domestic abuse, and finally the phenomenal performance from Elisabeth Moss. This film wouldn't of worked if the performances were bad and you didn't connect with any of the characters, but luckily in this case the complete opposite was achieved. All the characters were liekable, and you genuinely wanted Cecilia to be happy and free from Adrian. Aldis Hodge and Storm Reid were also fantastic, and the dynamic between them both and Elisabeth Moss was believable and organic. The messages about domestic abuse despite uncomfortable needed to be told. The fact that the abuse was told and not shown for me was more effective, Adrian controlled everything that Cecilia did, so you understood her pain and her fear making it a compelling story arc. Finally my biggest positive would be the fantastic performance Elisabeth Moss. Every emotion she expressed was incredibly believable up to the point of me actually believing she was the character. As her mental state got slowly and slowly worse her performance got better and better, so hats off to Elisabeth for this excellent showing of her acting abilities.Overall, despite the logic and script falling apart slightly in the final reveal, the invisible man was still the best horror of the year, excellently crafted fantastic themes, and some of the best directing and lead performance that I have seen."
541,*spoiler alert*so i'm led to believe that this guy who's supposed to be some genius didnt realize that his second suit is gone?
542,"One of the best movies i have watched in the recent past. The camera work was outstanding, acting was excellent and the screen play was outstanding. All in all, it keeps you on the edge every step of the way."
543,"After an intriguing and promising start this one got mediocre pretty damn quick for me. Lots of predictable horror/slasher tropes, lazy and convenient writing. Nothing we haven't seen before. Zero subtlety or mystery either, everything has to be spoon fed and pointed out to the audience. The last 30 minutes pick up the pace and has a few entertaining moments but most of it is just over the top silly nonsense.Why anyone would want to haunt/stalk Cecilia/Elisabeth Moss I'll never know."
544,Kinda sci-fi and far from horror category. Lots of logical error.
545,I spilled some paint once. I'd like to know the voodoo magic the protagonist had to clean up that paint so quickly from all those intricate crevices.
546,Nothing to do with the original book or the previous adaptations. A new story focused on violence makes this film a must watch for any horror fan.
547,The lengths the guy goes to her in his life is pretty disturbing which made it a good movie.
548,"The supposedly ""invisible"" man could easily have been seen with thermal imaging. For $2000-3000 max, an amount Cecilia could easily have afforded, she could have bought a thermal scope -- they're available online. The basic premise of the movie is thus bogus.And, btw, this movie, as well as the 1933 movie, have almost nothing to do with H.G. Wells' fine book, which was about so much more than just being invisible. It was about disinhibition of man's primal urges, including the bloodlust urge to kill, which become irresistible when a man is no longer restrained by being visible to his fellow men, to human society."
549,The story is so full of plot holes it's like Swiss cheese.The acting is unbearable especially the lead actress... one facial expression and it's not the prettiest.Without a doubt this movie could have been good and at some points in the movie I almost forgot how bad it was.The suit idea was very interesting but where was the science or at least an explanation on how it's powered/works.After watching the trailer I was excited to watch but was left utterly disappointed and wanting to slap Elizabeth moss silly for being so annoying.
550,"The whole movie this woman is the victim on only her word the entire time. There is no back story the movie just starts with her running away. Terrible action sequences in the movie, terrible acting and terrible plot."
551,"Leigh Whannell deserves a lot of credit for the progress he's making as a filmmaker. Upgrade is one of my personal favourite films of the last few years, so to see him follow it up with another low budget, genre movie is great!Elizabeth Moss, who is fantastic in the movie and turns in a very physical and emotional performance, should get an Oscar nomination but she won't as the academy don't seem to appreciate horror movies...As for negatives, there aren't many, just nitpick stuff.Keep it up Leigh!"
552,The film is one of the best adaptations of The Invisible Man. It takes history to the 21st century and at the same time preserves its essence. It's amazing how well the theme of the original story carries with the analogy of dating violence. This is the real start of the Dark Universe.
553,So much hype... worst movie I've seen on the last 5 years.
554,"Like so many other reviewers here, I feel that this was the most boring, awful drivel Hollywood has produced ever. I gave it an hour before I had to quit, but if you give it 10 minutes you'll more than get the feel for how bad this stinker is."
555,"The Invisible Man is the best movie I have watched in a long time. So, I don't understand the usual haters reviewing this with 1 star.
First, as an horror fan, I can say that the script is quite interesting till the end. Also, the pace is adequate to keep you amazed around two hours and the music is quite effective.
Second, Elizabeth Moss does a great job. I think her interpretation is surprisingly realistic and intense.
Last, CGI using is correct. I do not like movies like IT2 that looks like a horror video-game.
So, overall an amazing modern version of The Invisible Man far from perfect but enjoyable during our lockdown time we live."
556,"Everyone is an expert on everything nowdays, it seem to me that people forgot how to enjoy movies. Yes, there were a few illogical scenes here but I would have to be a real nerd to rewatch the movie 3x just to document them.Those who rated the movie 1/10 are just not being reasonable and fair. Do yourself a favor and give this movie a chance. It deserves the average vote score more than many other movies I have seen recently."
557,"Great acting and story. Keeps you engaged through the whole film. A couple good twists, could have been more intense. Definitely worth a watch."
558,"What a movie ! ,I'd like to watch it again and again
the director is the actor of SAW , surprise!"
559,"It's ok, I was in suspense and entertained the whole time, it's got is flaws but overall I think is good to watch, I liked it even better than The Hollow Man which was really bad for me, this one is ok."
560,Very good movie must watch and it is worth to watching.
561,"Movies with content that is beyond reality or unimaginable are usually not my thing. In an action flick like Die Hard things happen that never take place in real life, but somehow they could be true. Being invisible is no such thing. Almost everyone has had some fantasy, usually early in life, of what it would be like to be invisible or to fly. So although it is impossible and even unimaginable the concept has a strong attraction. In this movie Cecilia's husband haunts her after she ran away. The plot makes this more or less plausible by having him - as an expert for optics - design a suit that accomplishes just that: being invisible. The effects of this when he ""shows up"" are quite scary and even as a skeptic for this kind of thing I found myself fascinated. And then we have this great actress, Elisabeth Moss. Maybe without her it would have been a different movie, but as it is I enjoyed it and just take the ""impossible"" for granted. Also the plot leads to an interesting and unexpected end."
562,"Fun, thrill and interesting.The screenplay is brilliant. The acting is gorgeous.The Cops are so silly. They act like fools."
563,"I really loved this film. Tense, smart and unique. I really don't understand all the negativity."
564,"Movie was pure trash. If anyone is invisble un human like, they should not be getting beat up. Simple."
565,"Really good and very realistic. You have never seen an invisible man movie like This one , it mixes supernatural , horror, sci-fi, domestic violence and mysterie , all well played by one actress"
566,"This was actually a great adaptation of the original Invisible Man. I had my doubts as I walked in, but was suprised at how well written and acted it was. There were bound so be some sports where it looks like the actresses and actors were just swatting at air, and of course there are some moments where it is agonizing for you, as a spectator and viewer, when you know you'd be fighting much harder than these weaklings, but no matter. That is the horror and thriller genre today, as it is.The story is paced evenly, it is believable and makes sense, until the end.SPOILERS:ü§∞ü§∞ü§∞At the end of the movie, our main character has been framed for hitting her best friend's daughter, writing an incredibly hurtful email to her sister and then killing her own sister, and all of these things make her look and sound certifiably insane as nobody is there to see that it truly was The Invisible Man and not Elizabeth Moss who did these things, and then the whammy. She's pregnant.Moss's supposed ""deceased"" husband, our Invisible Man, had a brother who happens to be a lawyer, as well as the estate lawyer for his brother, and he tells her that she has two options oh, stay there and rot in jail, or have the baby. He then says to her ""We will be waiting for your answer."" Implying that not only is he in on it, but that he knew about everything and that his brother is truly alive.Skip to the end and Elizabeth Moss feins suicide and stabs The Invisible Man with a hidden pen and is able to escape after he subdues a guard. She then makes it outside only to be subdued by The Invisible Man who tells her that he will kill everybody she knows and loves and that she'll never be happy as long as he lives.The Invisible man gets to her friends home and tries to kill the daughter, the father comes in and is beaten close to death only for Elizabeth Moss to bust in, use a fire extinguisher to blast The Invisible Man and bust a few caps in his Invisible tookus, only for it to be the brother behind the suit and mask.The police break into the Invisible Mans home and find the supposted dead husband alive. Elizabeth Mods says that it was him all along and that it was just a set up. She then goes to his home, puts on a show that she's just there to talk, then goes to the bathroom to put on the stashed Invisible Man suit that she found in the basement and slashes the husbands throat to make it look like suicide.My problem with this movie is the fact that the only real evidence that we, the audicne, have to go on is the word ""Suprise"" that was said to Elizabeth Moss earlier in the movie, by her husband in his suit. It just felt more like murder than it did justified vengeance. Other than that, a great movie worth your time."
567,"I read the reviews before watching this and decided to go ahead and watch it.
From the beginning, the mood was set and it was pretty tense. It held its own throughout the film with some neat little twists and turns.Cecilia was pretty good in her role and one could really relate to her situation. In fact, I really felt sorry for her at times!I thought it was a pretty solid film and consistently gripping. I liked the unexpected twists and turns, the plot was clever and the filming was good.I was hovering between a 7 and an 8, but after watching the film, I thought to myself, ""Yeah, I liked this film a lot!"" so gave it an 8. No nudity, a couple of naughty words, some blood, so a good family film!!! ;)"
568,"The Invisible Man will keep you on your toes and it is a thrilling movie. Overall, I enjoyed it, however, I wish they would've shown more of a story line for the relationship between Cecilia and Adrian at the beginning of the movie. Good overall and I recommend this movie."
569,"I'm not sure if it was intentional or scenes cut from the movie found their way into the trailers, but I was a bit disappointed when I noticed key points were not shown.
I was looking for the scary hand in the shower scene...... CUT.
The part when she indicates ""someone"" is sitting in the chair........ CUT.
I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have as I was focusing on the parts I'd seen in the trailer and thinking.... when will they feature in the film??
A good, tense movie nonetheless"
570,"Yeah OK it's watchable. It's well made, well acted, well edited and directed but I didn't leave the cinema wanting to text my friends to say YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS like I did for example with Joker.It bounces along at a fair old pace and never lags which is an accomplishment for a movie almost 2hrs long. I never looked at my watch once which for me is rare.Story line has several flaws but hey it's a film about an invisible man! Ending I thought was a let down and there are plenty of times afterwards I found myself saying ""yeah but why didn't she....""It will no doubt make a handy profit as there are no major stars in it and I can see a sequel already in the works."
571,EM is superb a always and she really makes the movie work as best as it can. Though it has its flaws they are not enough to detract from an enjoyable watch...worth a look...
572,"I was a bit hyped by this movie at first. But I clearly stopped being hyped after the first 15 min. This movie is so bad. The music is annoying, the scenes are toooo longs. Like seriously, we already know the invisible guy is here, we know something will happen, be original in the scripts! Don't be like in all horror movies.So many scenes are totally stupid. The scene in the hospital, she cuts herself, she can break a 1billon$ suit with a pen, and all the security guards are so stupid to come 2 by 2 and be useless, while the woman is watching the scene without using the gun she has in front of her ! Even when there is no more cop...The friend 6"" bodybuilder cop with a gun is beaten by some skinny 5"" nerd with no weapon. Does this suit give you super power or this is all stupid?The ending is so predictable! We knew she was about to do this when she left the room...More to say. But just, don't watch this.I do not recommend."
573,"This is the new slew of terrible movies like Get Out, both of the It movies and Us that critics and the public with awful taste in movies seem enamored with. The first ok scene doesn't happen for a whopping 1 hour. Excruciatingly dull. Some scenes just drag on forever with zero tension or suspense. One deranged reviewer stated they were on the edge of their seats. More apropos would be on the edge of your seat wanting to leave. We watched the whole movie hoping that it would improve but it just worse. Save yourself a mind numbing dull 2 hours and watch anything else. It didn't help that the main actress somehow got even more unattractive as the movie went along."
574,"Trailer makes you want to watch this movie but the movie itself loses it half way through, gets boring and predictable"
575,"10/10 - this captivating drama is a master class in suspense, production design, acting, and storytelling as a whole"
576,"Let's see...The Invisible Man is wealthy...he leaves $5,000,000 to his wife. He is intelligent enough to create a way of making himself invisible. So...what does he do? He fakes his death and terrorizes his supposed widow. This screams of Lifetime Network Fantasy.The lead female has zero life. She inherits $5,000,000 and no one is banging on her door or calling her to do anything with her. Seriously...would you just hang out at home after your ex committed suicide? She's not really a hottie...wouldn't you go to the spa and get a makeover? Wouldn't you travel to Hawaii or someplace exotic? She should at least have bought a boob job!So she gets terrorized and because she is a single female with only the convenient police officer friend she doesn't talk to friends or acquaintances about anything. She also does all the stupid single woman in a house things possible. Hear noises at night? I think I'll just step outside in front of my bushes with no lights on and look around. No weapons in hand...don't turn out the lights...don't scope out the front from inside the house first. Nope. I'll just walk outside while ""Oh Mr. Krabs it is the music"" goes on to create tension.Then there is The Invisible Man himself. Does he not crap or pee or eat or sleep? I mean, if he is hanging out in the house all day and she is around you would think she would notice food or drink missing or that someone was using the bathroom. Where does he go to take a shower? How does he feed himself? Where does he poop? Who's toilet paper does he use? Does he ever wash? He has to be pretty ripe smelling if he doesn't get cleaned up.It is also somewhat cold at night where they are at. Is he naked all the time? Where does he sleep that no one notices?I've also known plenty of females. You know what most women do if they believe they are being stalked? GET A BIG GUARD DOG! GET A SECURITY SYSTEM WITH THAT $5,000,000!Ultimately this is a glorified LMN man stalking woman movie. At least LMN advertises their showings as such.This is just another awful piece of Hollywood dreck"
577,"I don't like writing reviews, I tend to just rate the movie and move on. But I felt compelled to review this one, as it it truly an atrocious movie. I went in with high hopes but right from the beginning it started going sideways. Brief spoiler: you pick up your sister in the middle of the night, with this terrible look on her face, she screams drive, drive, but no, this would be the perfect time to question her to find out what is going on. And even when he punched the window in, it still took a moment for them to move. Like seriously? And there were so many other plotholes, it is strange this movie has a high rating.I wasted 2 hours for this, my advice, avoid this unless you absolutely nothing to do."
578,"This is about as bad an adaption as possible.
The point of the invisible man concept, and Welles' story, is how invisibility would likely change anyone into villain. The entire film could have been made with the villain visible and there would barely be a difference.
There is literally no point to beginning as a villain.
What the result is a below average even for Lifetime Channel type film of the endless chase by abusive partner film.
It certainly is not a feminist take since Moss's character makes endless, frankly moronic, bad decisions"
579,Just terrible. Nothing makes sense. Cant believe this movie is rated so high. Pure garbage. Lost interest in the character 20 minutes into the movie. Dont bother.
580,"Just another white man bad, fight the patriarchy movie.Hard to watchFull of plot holesInsult to the former movies"
581,"The invisible man.I was lead to believe it was a tense thriller, it isn't. it's domestic abuse revenge storyline worked well enough but It contained every cliche imaginable. There are more original plots in a Columbo movie from the 70s TV .Ironically I went to see the movie with my wife, who bowed down to my choice it was my birthday treat, she said ""I don't want to see that, it's too violent"" . She loved it, perhaps she identified with the domestic abuse storyline and the oppression of women ( I chose the film after all) well she gave it 10/10, I alas gave it a incredibly bad 3/10"
582,"I usually wait a day or two before posting my thoughts on a movie, so I can collect them into a semi-intelligible paragraph, but this one demanded an instant review just after leaving the cinema. It was great! I loved it and my expectations were far exceeded. I think the fantastic Elisabeth Moss might be one of the most under-rated actors working today. The big screen filled up with her emotive and expressive face, all without hardly moving a muscle, is a thing of magic. I clutched my blanket (freezing cold theatre) to my chin the entire time, following every twist and shocking turn. It's the best kind of scary thriller, and I definitely recommend seeing it."
583,"Finally a fresh new idea for a film that hasn't been done many times before & its done very well.The film is very good at setting the tone for the audience, you may say its not a horror, but when something invisible is haunting you, something you cant see is there, it really plays on the mind of the audience & Cecilia (Played by Elisabeth Moss), she does a amazing job of playing that crazy mind person throughout the film where no one believes her, because lets face it, if something is invisible, you would never believe someone until they slip up or be less careful when being invisible. In terms of the film maybe being called horror, its not the usual type of blood & ghosts type of horror, it is purely something you cant see, which in its self is tormenting enough, just imagine having something invisible in real life haunting you & playing on your mind over & over till you crack & got no where to hide.The story makes sense, Cecilia's partner is a world leader in optical science but is very controlling in relationships & Cecilia try's to escape that life, but he ends up using his invisible tech to his advantage & use it against Cecilia. Cecilia has no idea on what to do at first to beat him, but she soon learns on how to finally reveal where he is, using paint at one point to reveal the suit he is using, she also uses some clever tactics like putting coffee granules on the floor because if he steps on the coffee it will leave a footprint showing where he is, so they defiantly thought of different ideas to catch him.There is a few big twists in the film which we did not expect, so we literally had to rethink what was going on until they revealed what the plot twist was, it was very clever & thought out. Now with a film like this there was some bloopers we kinda picked up on but tbh we weren't to sure on what the actual answer was so we just left it.We watched the film in Superscreen 2D & the bigger screen was nice to fill more of that empty space in the film, the enhanced sound was nice as well for the eery sounds.Overall though a really good film that totally refreshes the scary genre of films & films like this don't often come along so this is a deffo watch.Age - 25Cinema: Cineworld Milton Keynes Superscreen 2D (Unlimited Card)Watch, Avoid, Consider: Watch 100%."
584,"This reboot of the classic horror villain begins with a very tense scene and doesn't let up from there. The film manages to feel both classic and modern, thanks to Leigh Whannell's script and direction.The acting is very strong, with Elisabeth Moss in particular turning in a very strong performance. The tension is palpable throughout the film, aided by the pounding score from Benjamin Wallfisch. The movie doesn't opt for cheap scares either, each jump feeling earned at not just stuck in there for a reaction.My favourite thing about the film is how it combines supernatural horror with real life horror. The Invisible Man is of course unrealistic, however combined with an abusive boyfriend the stakes feel higher and the fear is heightened. It's a unique investigation into domestic abuse and the effects that it has and elevates this film above a standard horror film. I definitely recommend seeing this film."
585,This movie is chilling the suspense is great and its a great thriller! The score in this movie is also fantastic! Elizabeth moss is amazing! For basically a one women show she kills it! The direction of the movie is great! My only complaint is it starts a little slow but man after that it goes! Go see this movie!
586,The first issue I have with this is the choice of this beyond non-attractive female lead that makes it very unbelievable to think that this dude would even go through this type of effort for a Shrek looking witch...
587,Interesting storyline. Didn't expect the ending. The lead actress did a good job portraying her character.
588,"A fantastic movie full of twists and turns to keep you guessing. Awesome acting, I love scary movies but this is the only one that's made me jump. Absolutely loved it!!"
589,"Really enjoy this movie, especially the tension build up and music. For instance the beginning of this movie, with only one word, you could cut the tension in the air with a knife. You can feel how much she been terrified by the domestic violence. But this also made how female character change later in the movie a bit less believable. I also think the final scene of killing husband a little bit cheap compare to the rest of movie."
590,Kudos to Elisabeth Moss for conveying an intense minute to minute sanity metamorphosis but the scenarios were unrealistic; Incidents occurred in public and institutional settings but a Camera/Video was never mentioned for her defense until the movie needed to end!
591,"In a world where Hollywood likes to remake films that are only 20 or 30 years old or even foreign movies that were only released a year or two ago, it was inevitable that we would receive another rendition of The Invisible Man at some point. This story has been around for decades and even over a century now. The original novel of the same name was written and published by H. G. Wells in 1897. Since then, numerous television shows, movies, and similar concepts like the film Hollow Man have been flooding the screens. Even though the classic 1933 film still holds up as a great story, the concept has always felt a little cheesy to me. Well, this film does a great job of making this idea feel fresh because I was glued to the screen from start to finish. Here's why 2020's The Invisible Man worked so well for me.The Invisible Man follows Cecilia as she escapes an abusive relationship and takes shelter at a friend's house. After some time passes, she is given word that her significant other has died. Once at ease, she slowly begins to become victimized by him again, but she can't see him. Convinced that she is being terrorized by him and that he has found a way to make himself invisible, she is seen as an insane person by everyone in her life. Without ruining anything, the twist of this movie makes it feel very much like a film that would be released in 2020. The Invisible Man has been revamped for the modern era and I believe it was done in a very satisfying way.Movies like this, especially in the genre that it's in, relies heavily on the central character. Thankfully, Elisabeth Moss as Cecilia delivers an incredibly devoted performance, sucking you into her traumas and heartbreaks. Her character goes through more in the course of a few days than anyone should have to endure in an entire lifetime and Moss sells that from start to finish. Yes, the story and situations around her require a lot of acting, but there is a particular moment that happens in this film that had my jaw on the floor due to how surprising it was, and her performance took it to another level. The amount that she emotes throughout the course of this film blew me away.Stefan Duscio does some remarkable work as the Cinematographer here as well. His work on Upgrade was really solid and I even thought The Mule was shot really well, but this is truly his moment in the sun. The way the camera moves to show an empty area in a room, making it obvious that someone is probably standing there was impeccable here. On top of that, there are some great wide angles that really stood out and helped explain each situation, without saying a single word. The standouts here were truly the performance by Elisabeth Moss, as well as the camerawork, headed by Ruscio.In the end, The Invisible Man is great for many reasons, a couple of which would ruin the film if I got into them, so I'll just let you experience those. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch, who is definitely not a stranger to working on a great project, nicely blends the classic feel of old horror, with the loud build-ups that modern horror movies usually have. I found myself immersed in this film from start to finish. The main twist had me slightly underwhelmed at first, but it grew on me and won me over by the end. Overall, I have a few minor complaints, but I pretty much loved this movie otherwise. I highly recommend checking it out, unless violence and horror is not your thing."
592,Elisabeth Moss and the supporting cast were wonderful. The suspense starts from the first scene. Loved it!
593,"I had doubts about this movie. I loved Claude Rains' Invisible Man and I enjoyed Kevin Bacon's performance in Hollow Man. I loved watching the thin line between brilliance and madness. What would you do if you could truly get away with it? Fulfill sick, twisted desires? Have some harmless prankish fun? I never liked the idea of a movie about The Invisible Man being told from the female-victim's point of view. However, I loved Leigh Whannell's Upgrade. I saw it twice in two days. Why not try his take on The Invisible Man Tickets were purchased in early-March 2020, but it was cancelled due to an invisible virus sweeping the nation. Caught it tonight as HBO's Sat. night movie and if you suspend all logic, you will love it. If you are a logical person like me, you will hate it. Would a billionaire genius who looks like Oliver Jackson-Cohen (""The Invisible Man"") have to pull such elaborate schemes to knock-up a woman? Why was The Invisible Man so obsessed with his bland, unappealing and uninteresting girlfriend (played by Elisabeth Moss)? Instead of a fake suicide/kidnapping plot, why didn't The Invisible Man just rely solely on his invisibility suit to stalk and drive his runaway girlfriend mad? Why did he repeatedly violently attack his pregnant girlfriend? What if she miscarried the kid he so desperately wanted? Why did his girlfriend casually expose the invisibility suit, she used to kill him, to her police friend? Who kills themselves by slashing their own neck? The way it ended and big box office returns may spawn a sequel titled The Invisible Woman. Marvel already has an Invisible Woman, so maybe not. Either way, I'll pass."
594,Why not have a WAY better looking main character? Like come the EFF on! Everyone knows this movie won't be nominated for any prestigious awards for its actors. It's a joke.
595,This movie was long and drawn out. The cops role was that of a total idiot. Especially 3/4 in. What a sad script to make him look like a buffoon. This movie was highly anticipated and it failed miserably in my view. The ending was totally predictable given the amount of time left in the movie. Do they think audiences are stupid? ::4 yawns::
596,"Acting was really lame.
Character development was none.
From start to end it is so predictable, both dialogue and action.What is amazing about this movie, are the reviews here and its score.
For such a poor-made movie, yes, that is incredible!...
Don't waste your time. Skip it! Watch the old ones instead. You'll be truly rewarded."
597,"It is true that men obsess about things and people, but obsession must be grounded and developed to work as motive in a movie. Why would the invisible man, Adrian Griffin, go through all that just to mess with a woman in her late thirties? Why would Griffin, a man of science, want an older woman to bear his child? He's young, intelligent, successful, rich, and good-looking.Some people are abusers because they are just terrible human beings, but for a guy who can build an invisibility suit, the drive must be matching.Now, imagine if she had filed for divorce and took half his money or if she had stolen some of his ideas and made a fortune out of them, that would have given him a proper motive to ruin her life and would have made the movie a lot more palatable."
598,I normally would review but this was so poor i felt i had to warn everyone. Im afraid the back story and the charactor build up of the invisibleman was just shocking there was some very poor Acting through out this movie it seemed to try and rush so much thought out the film if you want to watch a decent Invisableman film watch the one with kevin bacon much more entertaining!!!
599,"Anybody who rated this higher than 5 needs to not be rating movies anymore!!Obviously a Liberal agenda-I waited and waited and waited for something to thrill me but it fell short every time!10 minutes of character building may have helped because --PLOP-- The beginning of the movie must hope the viewer figures out on their own that ""Tony Stark"" went sideways. No other way to remotely explain it."
600,Great suspense horror nail-biting thriller by taking a classic character and give him a serious treatment by a good story and script and awesome performance from Elisabeth Moss.
601,"If you have a good surround setup this movie is a must-see for the audio alone. It's really an excellent surround mix. You can feel the crickets on the lawn, the rain drops outside. You feel inside the scene. Unfortunately the story is a let down. The characters change too much overtime especially the ending is a let down. This movie could have been much more. In the end its only mediocre.Extra kudos go to the performance of Aldis Hodge."
602,"Really, in writing and directing, this is a huge leap from his Saw, Insidious and Upgrade days. I like all of those except The Last Key (which he also wrote), but this... this is different, this is amazing. How he builds atmosphere with POV shots, empty background shots, sounds and music. Supported like crazy by Moss's excellent acting, this film has got a solid 9 from me. I'm sure James Wan is proud. More than that, Whannell didn't just remake a classic movie or adapt Well's novel. He took Well's main concept and made his own story with his own theme for abused victims. With this, Whannell just enter his name onto my list of favorite writers and directors."
603,"I was reminded of an Iron Maiden lyric when I sat through the atmospheric Invisible Man this past Wednesday. ""I have a phobia that someone's always there"" from Fear of the Dark perfectly sums up the notion this film brings to the table. Fear and suspense are built on what isn't present, and this movie has us searching the entire time for a figure we know we can't see. It is the subtle movements and sudden changes to normal everyday situations that make our heart pump a little faster and our ears prick up to listen in. This movie will certainly make your neck skin crawl as you watch scene after scene with lingering shots and negative dark spaces.Undoubtably, this is a movie about the lingering presence of an abuser. A person who escapes a controlling and abusive monster might find they have layers of damage and paranoia hammered deep into their psyche. A quick look over the shoulder every minute or so, a second or third checking of the lock on the front door, or perhaps a weapon hidden close-by at all times. These are all terrifyingly real scenarios people find themselves in, and so too does our character. Cecilia (Elizabeth Moss) has the added disadvantage of financial reliance on her former prison warden, and that plays a major role in the power he wants to exert over her. It is one of many control mechanisms her former tormentor held over her, but this film shows, rather than tells, us about her past situation. It's a welcome mixture of well-executed shots mixed with natural and believable acting. In short, this film is a win for the genre.While many films in the past years have tried to take advantage of a climate rife with abuse stories and sexual violence, this film engages smartly with the topic and does so without pandering. It is easy to attempt this theme with dollar signs in your eyes, but if there is no understanding in the writing, then it comes down like a house of cards. The titular Invisible Man is genuinely horrific and scary, but this monster is well-grounded in reality. The performance by Elizabeth Moss was both believable and gut wrenching. I was strongly reminded of the desperate performance put forth by Winona Ryder in the popular Stranger Things series. There is incredible depth to her skill set, and because the dialogue seemed so natural, it exerted a strong sympathetic response from the ol' amygdala.The deciding factor that made this film great was not what was on screen or what was said, but just the opposite. What you don't see and what remains unsaid is what stokes the engines of your mental cogs, and so the negative spaces are filled by your own mind's worst cast scenario. For a filmed called the Invisible Man, it does so well with POV shots and odd angles. You're never quite sure if there is something you can't see, or if it is Cecilia's imagination. Naturally there is a point where the imaginary phantom is replaced by an actual one, but you're often guessing and unable to tell where the next scare is coming from, which means you're on edge for most of the film.The only detractors in play for this film are a handful of odd plot holes, and a third act that is less horror and more action, otherwise you're missing out if you don't go see this. This is an adaptation worth the cost of it's recreation, and that is seldom a compliment handed out in the horror genre in general. Bring your ear plugs if you're sound sensitive."
604,"Good Movie which can keep audience attention until Last moment!
Best Moment of Movie is:
Surprise!!!"
605,"I thought that it would be much better ,but it wasnt and and some people may jump etc I enjoy well made horror movies but it was not really well made and if you thought about what was going on you could figure out the guts of the story."
606,"This move is honestly awful.The storyline is just full of plot holes that are never explained, the ""invisible man"" isn't at all scary and the way he stalks her isn't consistent and makes no sense. The cast selection is also TERRIBLE. The lead actress doesn't match with both her husband and her close cop friend. What were they thinking?!?! Nothing is genuine about this movie, it reeks of try hard and is just at best a 3/10. This movie SUCKED. Save your money and watch something else."
607,"It was enjoyable. It was mostly predictable, but was still pretty well done and the turns towards the end made it much better."
608,"Absolutely phenomenal film! Jaw dropping moments, spine tingling moments, wtf moments. Awesome movie"
609,"The Invisible Man is a must see! It is genuinely scary with fabulously crafted, intense sequences! The acting in this film is what makes it even better! There are some iffy scenes related to violence, but if you have scene movies with bad violence, this movie is fine.
SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE INVISIBLE MAN!!!!!!There is a scene where Cecilia is having dinner with her sister and telling her about what is going on. She tells her sister that she wants to go somewhere public so the invisible man cannot attack her. Instead the invisible man picks up a knife and cuts open Cecilia's sister's throat, then places the knife in Cecilia's hand while she is in shock. This is not extremely graphic but comes out of nowhere and is very disturbing!!END OF SPOILERS!Elizabeth Moss is outstanding in this film! The writing makes it even better. I would definitely recommend this movie if you like films with lost of jump scares and intense, quiet moments!"
610,"As expected Elisabeth was splendid in her role and makes the audience feel the genuine pain and trauma that she goes through in this movie. Right from the first scene the audience are bought into the Eerie premise and haunting nature of the story. The camera, background score is spot on with jump scares well placed and meaningful. Definitely worth your money on an IMAX as I did as it provides a complete experience with theater shattering masterpiece."
611,"I had very high hopes for this movie, and it did have its upsides. The idea of the plot is interesting and the picture is very good. You can tell that the team behind it is talented as it really is a well-made movie. The lead actress has to be acclaimed for her role. Even though, I was bored watching it as well as disappointed when walking out of the cinema.The start of the movie was good and quickly pulled you in. But after that... it didn't really go any deeper. Although the movie addresses some important topics such as domestic violence, it failed to make you care about them. As the movie lacked engagement, it became quite boring. The characters also failed to impress. There was very little explained about the relationships between the characters and you failed at getting to know them. There were some pretty non-believable character development as well as them behaving in - to say the least - not very credible ways which were really annoying and made it hard (impossible) to have compassion for them.The plot, a woman escaping from an abusive ex that manages even after his own death to keep controlling her, is by the sounds of it a captivating story. But unfortunately it was both predictable and full of serious plotholes (hard to describe closer without spoiling). The movie would have been way scarier if had been conducted in a more believable way.I'd say I enjoyed the first 25% of the movie, when it was mainly a combination of a thriller and a horror film, which definitely kept me at the edge of my seat. The rest of the movie though was more of an action movie, which made you periodically yawn, mostly just waiting for the movie to be over (as by this point it was pretty obvious how it would end), alternatively come with up with some clever twist (it didn't).So for people wanting to enjoy an occasionally scary action movie, this is probably a pretty good movie. If you want to watch something deeper, more psychologically scary with a clever story, I'd recommend something else."
612,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A suspenseful horror story about an abusive relationship, very well acted by Ms. Moss as the intended victim.JIM'S REVIEW: With all of the bad news in 2020 (e.g., the Trump presidency running rampant, the Coronavirus' devastating effect growing globally, and the stock market now in free-fall, it only seemed proper that my first film of the year should be a horror film. And it is.The Invisible Man has morphed at a movie theater near you. The movie is a highly entertaining reimagining of this boogeyman tale very loosely based on the H.G. Wells novel. This re-boot has some plot contrivances, but the tension and subtle touches work quite well.There is also no gauzed wrapped phantom as in James Whale's 1933 classic horror film starring Claude Rains as the crazed madman. This updated version makes its modern-day monster an abusive ex-lover out to get revenge from his victim. Caught in a violent relationship with wealthy scientist Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), Cecilia Krass (Elisabeth Moss) finally escapes his wrath...at least temporarily. Stalking his prey with his invisibility suit, he hides in full sight hoping to give the appearance of Cecilia's recurring madness to family and friends. He takes gaslighting to a whole new level of menace.In this version, writer / director Leigh Whannell cleverly spins his tale of suspense with just the right amount of dread, although the gore level seems slightly overdone. Just as our heroine never knows if her attacker is lurking nearby, the moviegoing audience immediately feel her fears and anxiety as well. He wisely capitalizes on the human drama showing the effects of an abusive ex and his obscene control over his former lover. The set-up is a stark reminder of the continuing traumas faced by so many victims and their battle to fight back in this MeToo Movement era.
The acting is consistently strong. Ms. Moss centers the film with a skillful performance as the damsel-in-distress. (Horror films of late have given us terrific performances by actresses such as Toni Collette (Hereditary), Florence Puhl (Midsommar), and Lupita Nyong'o (Us) to name some recent examples. Ms Moss' acting is of that same high calibre. Mr. Jackson-Cohen, when on screen, establishes his character's evil intentions most effectively. Providing fine support are Aldis Hodge, Storm Reid, Michael DForman, and Harriet Dyer as Cecilia's sister, Emily.The CGI works well. (Loved that cold breathe that suddenly appears behind Cecilia as she ventures outside and the measured use of some levitating objects as weapons.) The film is well paced as it builds to a very powerful climax. Yes, there are some illogical plot issues, but the movie takes its time to establish convincible characters caught in credible situations with some unexpected twists, turns, and bumps in the night. Still, one cannot help but wonder about Cecilia's poor decision-making and its repercussions, all of which seem as if they are more plot-driven devices than real life scenarios. (A few more working drafts could have clarified matters and given the film more impact.)Some say that love is the flip side of hate. Mr. Whannell takes that well-worn premise and makes a truly scary movie. Welcome to 2020!"
613,"""The Invisible Man"" (2020 release; 124 min.) brings the story of Cecilia. As the movie opens, Cecilia is in bed, next to her boyfriend, eyes wide open, with the alarm clock reading 3:41. She gently gets up and it is clear that she is trying to make her escape, having drugged her boyfriend. She barely manages to get away and is picked up by her sister Emily. We then go to ""Two Weeks Later"", as Cecilia is in a safe house with a friend. Emily stops by again, and has big news: Adrian (the ex-boyfriend) has killed himself! At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you;ll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie has been in development hell for years (at one point Johnny Depp was attached to it), and then finally was made as a Blumhouse Production. Blumhouse has built a nice role in making clever ""scary"" movies on a limited budget. The film is a reimagining, if not reboot, of the classic 1930s movie of the same name , which in turn is based on the H.G. Wells 1890s book. Of course in the reboot the story is set in today's Bay Area. The film is written and directed by Leigh Wannell, himself no slouch in ""scary"" movies (Saw I, II and III, as well as Insidious 1,2 and 3). From the get-go, the movie is very tense/intense, starting with Cecilia's escape from Adrian's house. It's not long before things get worse. Of course with the ""bed guy"" being invisible, less is more, and it's incredibly effective. I would call the first half of the movie more of a psychological thriller than it is a ""Scary"" movie. Check out the very first scene where Cecilia realizes that there is an invisible man in her room. The movie benefits enormously from the outstanding lead performance by Elisabeth Moss, who is in practically every frame of the film. The second hour of the movie is still very good, even if not as captivating as the first half, as eventually all hell breaks loose and bodies start flying left and right. As we approached the movie's climax, I kept thinking to my self ""I cannot believe how good this movie is!"".""The Invisible Man"" opened wide this weekend, and is projected to do quite well at the box office, although I certainly couldn't tell that, as the Friday early evening screening where I saw this at in a large theater was attended poorly (about 15 people). But there is a reason why this film is currently rated 90% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes: the movie is frighteningly good, just rock solid from start to finish, and for me the very unexpected best movie of 2020 (so far). I'd readily suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
614,"I just got out of The Invisible Man With my eldest son.Despite an awful ad campaign which gave far too much away (I'll get to that later) this really worked for me and is the best horror I have seen for a long time. Elizabeth Moss is superb, (granted she always is) but the full movie rests on her shoulders, if she does not pull her performance off, the full movie fails. All the acting is really good to be honest and something I really liked was it does not rely on jump scares either. although there are a few, they are not lazily done!! It's not just the usual lame loud noises to the usual moment we have seen 100 times before etc.It's opening hour or so is a bit of a slower paced than you'd expect. This works for me though because I'm more interested in Psychological Horror than Supernatural or Slasher Horror movies, give me a Black Swan over Annabelle any day of the week, and this plays into that arena. Actually my favourite part of the movie was the slower first half, as Moss appears to be losing her mind.It has a few problems, it's a bit too long despite only being 2 hours, it's score is insanely over the top and there is one big glaring plot hole (which it makes a big deal of at times, but then ignores at others), there are a few plot holes actually and although it's script does have some smart dialogue in it, at other times it's really cliche. But that really is nit picking and none of them really stop my enjoyment of this movie, as it often surprise and is REALLY intense at times.I still think calling it The Invisible Man was a mistake. As we knew he wasn't dead and had found out how to be invisible. So the suspense or intrigue of the supernatural or psychological breakdown (was she doing it or herself) aspects was gone!! As for the trailers, some of the big moments are in the trailers, but there are also big moments in the trailers, that are not present in the movie, but one thing the trailers did really well, was edit things out of sequence.I'd recommend not watching another trailer and see this as soon as possible."
615,"It is an ode to feminism. An ugly and old woman wanted to release from the control of her lovely husband. He loved her and wanted to have kids with her, so he was guilty. In that case, it was funny.
The director tried to develop his idea from Upgrade but unsuccessful in that. If Upgrade worth to see it once and forget, I can't say the same about this movie. This movie is better to skip."
616,"It's unbelievable, that this movie got this high rating.."
617,"I'm so disapointed in this movie. What I thought would be a good suspense thriller turned out to be a horrible mess of plot holes, bad story telling and even worse acting. Something so out of place and ill conceived it was hard to watch at times. I knew I should have turned it off after the first 15 mins but I kept hoping it would get better but it just kept getting worse and worse. If this movie was shown in theaters, it would have been removed after one week."
618,"The Invisible Man works on many levels: as an atmospheric edge-of-your-seat thriller, as a subversive horror film, as a character study, as a mystery, and as an Upgrade-style action movie with big ideas. The opening scene is excellent in setting the atmosphere for the film and providing clear information through details. The tension is obvious through Moss' body language and nervousness, and Adrian's controlling nature is clear through Moss and the many house security protocols. After the explosive opening, we get to know Cecilia, and the emotional trauma from her abusive relationship is obvious. In the middle section, Whannell does an excellent job of using slow pans and empty shots to foster uncertainty in the audience's mind as Cecilia gets more anxious. He also refuses to use traditional horror tropes in jump scares, instead masterfully building the tension as we wonder who the invisible man is and if he's really there. My biggest concern by far for the movie was that it would turn into the easy, traditional trope of a mentally unstable female unreliable narrator explaining everything away. Not only is it a tired theme, it would also reinforce the women being crazy and needing medication angle that's problematic in society. Instead, Whannell makes the timely and important point that women should be listened to and generally know more about their situation than men who don't know them assume to. The action towards the end (especially the hallway in the hospital and in the house) were great, as anyone who watched Upgrade would expect. The ending is shocking but completely sensible - anyone complaining about plot holes is either nitpicking like crazy or trying to find what isn't there. Moss' performance is what elevates this movie to the stratosphere. Her discomfort and trauma from her relationship with Adrian early on is nailed, and we see her fear only increase as she sees the gaslighting, isolationist patterns recurring. The bags under her eyes and jumpiness show how it takes a toll on her. What's really clever is how, once she hits the invisible man and sees she was right, she is more self-assured and aggressive. I empathized deeply with her, and it's so easy to - she's being traumatized and accused of terrible crimes and nobody will listen to her. The ending is powerful, as she intelligently reclaims control of the situation and confirms she was right about everything that happened. It would be a strong film for the building tension and great cinematography as an anxious horror-thriller alone, but the clever themes which are punctuated by Moss' dynamite performance make it an early candidate for a top 10 or even top 5 movie of the year, even being the first movie I've seen in 2020. Between this and Upgrade, I will watch every movie Whannell comes out with in the future, and I couldn't be more all in on Elisabeth Moss."
619,"Great movie, was really done well. keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time."
620,"I saw this film for the first time recently and it was terrible the first hour was to slow and not very interesting the twists were cheap and it had a poor ending,it could and should have been better."
621,"The suspense is goosebumps worthy. Is there something there, just in the shadow? We've all thought that at least once! The paranoia setting in. No one believing a word you say, thinking your crazy.
I really enjoyed this. Made me jump more times that I can count!
Watch for what it is. A good film that makes you think!!"
622,"The Invisible Man is a solid popcorn horror movie experience that is tight with no ounce of excess fat. The story is immediately tense from the first frame onwards and the tension progressively grows at an itsy-bitsy dreading pace, like a rubber band slowly being unhurriedly pulled to the point of snapping but you're watching in agony anticipating when exactly when it will happen.The script adapts H.G. Wells' original story into a tale about domestic abuse told from the victim's viewpoint. Its relation to the source material is mostly in-name-only and does not follow the classic story about a descent to madness like Claude Rains or Paul Verhoeven's Hollow Man.Following up from 2018's Upgrade, writer-Director Leigh Whannel effectively puts the audience in the point-of-view of the victim. Stefan Duscio's cinematography is precise and creates that unsettled paranoia one gets when you think someone or something is behind you. The camera pans around as one would turn their neck to check what's there. The audience will find themselves unsettled from these panning shots of empty hallways and studying every inch of the frame looking for movement or reflection.Elizabeth Moss delivers a raw vulnerable lead performance. Admittedly I haven't seen much of her work before this film (only her supporting role in Jordan Peele's Us), it was impressive how much she pulled me in with verisimilitude. You can never feel Moss's acting; she just is the character. Her distressful performance as Cecilia could have easily been in an indie film about spousal abuse.The make-or-break point for audiences will be The Invisible Man himself, who acts as the monster of the story. Griffin is not a living and breathing human character. He's deliberately underdeveloped and hidden from the audience to be an entity representing the worst imagined version of an obsessive abusive partner. His obsession goes beyond the lengths of what a rich billionaire genius scientist would or could do at times to an unrelenting non-negotiable T-1000 level.Some viewers who crave a fleshed-out character and believability may find The Invisible Man's actions and behavior hard to buy. The film committing to its spousal abuse allegory does take its toll on the story. Though I don't know what the filmmakers could do about that. Horror films, for me, are about metaphors and every horror film requires one suspension of disbelief. I personally was fine taking The Invisible Man as a metaphor.That said, Oliver Jackson-Cohen is miscast as Griffin and doesn't carry the necessary dramatic weight when he is being the ""Visible Man"". An established actor who can exude a genuine sense of threat could have sold it much better and would have done a sufficient job closing the gap between Griffin being a character and an entity.Horror fans, Universal Monster film fans, and H.G. Wells fans will enjoy The Invisible Man as a good one-time watch at the theaters and will be in for some good scares and even surprises. While being a solid cinematic experience, it is still not quite up to being a classic status, but it's very well done."
623,"Awful film, bad writing, bad acting, how this is rated 7.1 ?"
624,"There is no back story, and it's unbelievable that this main character would have been involved with a rich millionaire genius as a ""kept"" woman that he controlled. At least make her attractive to make it believable. Couldn't get past the fact that no one would fake their death and give up everything to stalk this mousy woman. If your a kept wantingly perfect thing to this guy, think more of the character from Gone Girl. Besides that there are too many unbelievable parts as in she runs into the dog bowl, decides to get fully dressed before escaping, goes back for the dog, and her sister doesn't know enough to immediately take off when she's picked up after escaping. Nice plan. Also when her friends daughter is hit by ""her"", how she's about 8 feet away. Expected better, and I'm only half way through the movie lol"
625,A quick start (to rushed) an abused women attempts to escape her husband who has been terrorising and abusing her over a period of Time.It doesn't bother to show any evidence of this so how are we meant to care for the character from the outset. She escapes from him anyway aided by her sister who waiting for her as her getaway driver and ends up staying with her cop friend and his daughter who we don't know why she's staying there as surely more logical to stay her with her sister maybe I missed something there. Then after a couple weeks as gone by we are lead to believe the husband as killed himself and as left her five million dollars in his will over four years in installments (how considerate he doesn't want her to waste it) at the reading she then has a letter from him read out by his brother saying why did you leave me etc. From beyond the grave he begins to reak havoc again on her with a variety of acts what were quite simply hilarious at times. Elizabeth Moss is basically acting by herself most of the first half of the movie.(not very well) If this is meant to be scary it fails dismally. Many people hated Kevin Bacon's version of the invisible man (Hollow Man) but I'd take that over this miserable attempt any day of the week. After an hour you will be wondering shall I just leave now! but like me you will probly finish it and wonder why you did. I hated this film!! Please don't bother you have been warned by me and many others on here. Why has it got so many good reviews I asked myself because like me I believed the hype and ended up with this crap. And to top it off he wasn't even an invisible man it was a costume he had invented that he was wearing! NO science here! as were lead to believe earlier in the movie he was easily capable of making himself invisible so don't get me started there is so much I could say on that subject in terms of plot holes. Beyond awful.
626,"This movie really isn't about a sci-fi theme but rather gender issues, untrue ones at that."
627,"A room full of monkeys randomly tapping on keyboards for 1000 minutes could produce a more compelling and suspenseful plot. A warehouse full of snails randomly... slithering around could scribe, in slime, less offensively simplistic characters. A... a... nope, I've already devoted too much of my neuronal activity to this jumped up cartoon.Good day sir and/or madam. I said good day!"
628,"Ok, so you are telling me that when you are dressed in an invisible suit you don't need to eat, drink, swallow, sleep, or go to the bathroom. You also don't make any noises stepping on anything. But let's forger that, what the hell were they thinking when they were writing the script for this mess? What was the first invisible man thinking after being seen by so many people in the hospital? Why on Earth would they be even willing to go to this stalking extreme? Just to get in danger, being potentially hurt, or exposed? Please make smart and talented people make script for the movies."
629,"This seemed to take in the new genre of bad illogical sci-fi thrillers like 'The Quiet Place' and run with it.The scariest portion of the whole film was the sound that the eggs and bacon made. Outside of that - predictable and full of holes.I started to get quite annoyed with the phone in the attic and the fact that all of that evidence was left in the attic. The person in this suit makes no sound whatsoever either, so in addition to being invisible, the person wearing the suit is inaudible as well. So the initial attack scene commences and miraculously, all the paint that ended up on the suit is easily cleaned off in the sink in about 1 minute. Rubbish!Moss runs out of the house after this confrontation and got an Uber in about 30 seconds (as they are like bees at a hive in this neighborhood) and then went to Adrians estate. She discovers the bodysuit and has to leave in a hurry as Adrian returns (the dog is barking to alert Moss). She had nothing in her hands as I recall, but later in the film, she has the suit (in the not so thrilling conclusion) and who does she call? The press? The police? No - her sister. So she actually has the evidence which would prove that Adrian didn't kill himself and is stalking her and she calls her sister. Crap!After her sister is murdered in a restaurant, Moss is arrested and her friend, who is a policeman, interviews her with someone else in the room. In a police station for an interview, you would expect CCTV and there were two armed policemen present, so probably safe to say 'Listen, Adrian has this special suit...blah blah blah...', but nope she chickens out for some odd reason. (Not to mention that she has the evidence stashed somewhere).At the mental ward/jail, we learn that the cameras in the suit can take multiple stab wounds with no problems (in addition to the person wearing it). Only a slight malfunction for a second or two happens. In addition, the suit is completely water repellant despite being obviously electric. Also, Moss decides to kill herself by starting to slit her wrists. However, this is glossed over until she is wearing a bandage later in the film.Nevertheless, the wound magically is no longer an issue (running on adrenaline and the meds that the people at the ward gave her. Not likely to be a stimulant) neither are the stab wounds that the brother had inflicted on him. Invisible man driving a car also, not an issue.Basically, the ending was very predictable and also crap although I had to laugh at the close up face of the euphoric Moss at the end as the camera lingered there for far too long.Avoid this film...."
630,"In every part of the movie, nothing makes any sense.
Let¬¥s start with when she found his cellphone with pictures of herself sleeping and doesn¬¥t show it to anyone?
In the restaurant when he cut the troath of her sister, anyone check the cameras to see the knive flying by itself??
In the hospital when everybody was firing guns , why the people downstairs were in the room so calm, does anybody saw that the guards were killed by ""no one""??A movie with great potential, but completely destroyed."
631,I enjoyed this from beginning to end. It always kept my attention. Loved the fact that no one believed her.
632,"Well the invisible man a hard concept to get it work bcs all of these movies were soso but this one probably the wworst of them but it begins different as an psycho horror then after that concept didn't work anymore and got dumb it changes to be an actioner and gets even dumber ... The pacing is really terrible after like an hour i thought this should be over soon and felt bored. Acting was bad. Schockers not really present, sound was ok, effects were very underwhelming for an invisble man movie even fighting looked illogical and don't waste too much time about being logical with that movie it makes many mistakes.
Gets a few stars for at least some thrilling athmosphere but overall very forgetful ridiculous that it got listed by some as sci-fi which is an insult to the genre."
633,"I don't usually like horror misteries but this one worked for me. You know how these movies build tension by not doing much, only some scary moments, usually jumpscares? I usually turn off those movies but this one kept me interested right until the end and that's more important than the number of plot holes."
634,"Do you like a cardboard villain with no motive other than he is just a ""man"" who is mean and wants to control a woman?A friend who is a detective but can't figure out a damn thing on his own?Deus Ex machinas you can see a mile away?Leaps in irrational character behavior?Sewer hole sized plot holes?Well. If that's the case this is your movie. I had a hard time feeling ""thrilled"" or scared or worried or caring about anything in this movie. Which is a shame as I love Moss and her abilities. This movie's insipid dialogue and elementary plot kills itself. Look the movie is about a crazy guy who is also a young rich genius and everything else is absolute tunnel vision to shoehorn and keep this silly story on track. Watch Unsane instead."
635,"I still can't figure out if I watched the same movie as everyone else did cause I did not enjoy it, and how is it so highly rated?The characters are stupid. I can keep cribbing about the entire movie but then I would be giving out spoilers.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
636,"I dont think they make them so tacky anymore. This is not a movie you expect to see coming out in 2020. Bad predictable plot and super corny soundtrack and effects. No surprises. No reason to add spoilers because anyone who's seen a 90's thriller will know exactly how it ends. On the positive note the cinematography is decent.
Man I can't believe I paid for this."
637,Probably one of the worst of the....horror films i ever...and i mean ever watched
638,"It starts out good. You wonder what is really happening. Then in the middle part it drags out, and becomes really boring. And at the end, sadly like most horror movies these days, it goes overboard with action and just ends up silly and almost comical at times.
What really baffles me is the use of CGI animations when people fall. It looks cartoony and just made me laugh."
639,"Anyone with an average IQ and above should find this movie to be extremely dull and boring. The plot just reveals itself 30 minute into the movie and the wholes thing becomes a waste of time.
The film could have turned out to be way more entertaining with a few tweaks."
640,"Cecilia runs away from home. Her ultra modern seafront mansion is nothing but a large jail created to keep her in. But as she restarts her life outside of these walls, her abusive husband dead, someone is watching her from the shadows. Someone invisible. As the world around Cecilia starts to collapse, trying to bury everyone she cares about, she realises there's only one way to gain her freedom - to fight tooth and nail.The sterile promotional campaign doesn't do the film justice. THE INVISIBLE MAN is gory, brutal and unbearably tense.Shot on a tiny budget by Hollywood standards, 7 million dollars, the movie has a slick design, strong visual effects and memorable performances.Elisabeth Moss as Cecilia is at her best, as for the most of the film she acts opposite an empty space and makes it look engaging. The effects are minimalistic, but when they are on display it's glorious.The film has a perfect mixture of silent moments of built up tension and the bloody action. The action pieces seem relentless. Where some thrillers are ready for a grand finale THE INVISIBLE MAN is only warming up.Leigh Whannell knows how to create action sequences, he even created his own signature visual, as the camera falls together with a body, connecting to the ground with a shattering blow. He also is good with his endings - the ending of THE INVISIBLE MAN may not be what you expect it to be.Much deeper and more complex than the marketing campaign allowed it THE INVISIBLE MAN is an excellent psychological horror that does not shy away from explicit violence and gore."
641,"... this girl, who lives with this man, and according to her she wasn't allowed to leave the house, and she never caught on to the fact that he was masterminding an experimental invisible suit? His ""office"" was in the kitchen!"
642,"I believe it was Frank Capra who said, ""There is only one crime in cinema and that is to bore your audience."" I present Exhibit A. But not only is it boring, it's also unintentionally silly, which is completely unforgivable. How does becoming invisible give you superpower strength? Nonsense. Avoid."
643,"It's like a Woman In Peril movie meets some Monster schlock. The villain is a genius when it's convenient, and the woman is in terror until she isn't any longer for no special reason, or she is, but she can now deal with it and face of against the master genius who is suddenly just a rich guy who can afford a lot of toys no one else has. This is what happens when unimaginative artists meet too much money and don't know what kind of movie to make with it. I gave it a six because of the too much money production values."
644,"I recommend watching it.
You will see amazing acting and good story."
645,"The fact of knowing what is really happening turns this movie into a some kind of action movie more than a suspense one. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie, but it didn't catch me on the edge of the couch."
646,"But nowhere near the achievement it's being hyped as...The movie is well written and holds your attention well. It starts right into it and besides a noticeable lull midway, holds a steady pace.The problem is the trailer definitely spoils some of the tension, and if you've seen it, there goes a good part of it. Sploosh.The movie explores no new ground and is unfortunately painfully predictable. If you like the ""Why Does Nobody Believe Me?!?"" type of movies you know what you'll see. When the ""plot twists"" came up I could swear I felt someone pulling on my leg... haha.I wholly recommend watching this movie. It's an above average scifi/thriller type. Just don't expect too much and you'll be pleased..."
647,"Where do I even begin? Even without spoiling it you can easily pick apart this entire film. The positives of this film include the decent cinematography, a couple scenes with real and effective tension, and the fact that it's not boring or overly offensive with how bad it is.
This film takes place in a world like no other. Footsteps and breathing are completely inaudible (even though they would actually add tension and make things a tiny bit more believable), people make the most idiotic decisions when their lives are in danger, and --
What's worst about this film is how much it painfully lacks self-awareness. While the film definitely does some surprising things, showing you just how corny and low-brow they can get, you already know where things are going long before you get there. The overall plot of the movie is incredibly cliche and unsatisfying rather than interesting and thought-provoking.HOWEVER: Once you realize what kind of movie you're in for, things get really fun.For me I believe it was 40 mins into this long, lovely, and laughable movie. The film decides to lose all subtlety, all mystery, and all creativity pretty early. So what do you do? Nothing is scary anymore and the story is so off the rails you can't relate to anyone or anything that's happening. So you find entertainment in the mess that shines before you.
You laugh at the cartoony dialogue, jump and chuckle at the cheap and random jump scares, scratch your head at the brainless actions of the main character, snicker through the bad acting during the encounters with invisman, and try not to burst into laughter as things get crazier and crazier and the film takes itself waaaay too seriously.
So would I recommend this experience? Well I used a gift card and had the whole day off and wanted to spend some time with a good friend that I haven't seen in a while. It was free and I was entertained. Not as I was hoping to be, based on the reviews from people that actually thought it was good, but I had a good time. My friend actually liked it tho so that made things awkward.
(Ethan, if you're reading this, I'm glad you liked the twists and turns and scary wide angles. I really am.)"
648,"The first half was a nail-biting psychological thriller, but the latter relied on mostly cheap surprise and jump scare. On top of that, the plot's logic doesn't hold well once you get out the theater and start reflecting what you just saw. It was still a great movie, but it just wasn't as great as first half let me believed to be."
649,"A re-imaging of the classic H.G. Wells novel from director Leigh Whannell (Saw/Upgrade). Morphing elements of Hollow Man & Sleeping w/the Enemy, we have our heroine, played by A Handmaid's Tale's Elisabeth Moss, who plays a tortured & abused wife of a tech maven who has had it & one night escapes into the night w/the help of her sister. Staying w/an old friend & his daughter (played by Aldis Hodge & Storm Reid respectively) Moss tries to recuperate from her trauma which she feels she's on the road on when her ex's brother, his lawyer, announces his death leaving her a small fortune w/the caveat that as long as she's found mentally competent & commits no crimes she'll get the do re mi. No sooner than those words are uttered, the plot kicks into high gear as Moss is haunted (hunted?) by an invisible presence (her husband had constructed a optics laded jumpsuit which renders the wearer invisible) which of course no one sees but whose antics seem to point to Moss (until the last act). Miles away from where Whannell's previous outings were (I always found his earlier works a little sloppy), there is a certain elegance & restraint here but some shot set-ups are particularly clunky when a simple rethink would've gotten his idea across. Co-starring Oliver Jackson-Cohen (he was in Netflix's The House on Haunted Hill's first season) as Moss' husband."
650,"A man named terrance lost the ability to be physically seen. 'convienent,' says terrance. He gets on the bus to go and steal food from dennys. Thought he could slip on the bus for free. But as he sat in the back the bus driver blurts, 'you gonna pay son?' Terrances replys: 'i've gathered nothing to give.'"
651,Not much to write but this is a pretty decent film with amazing cinematography and tight screenplay with brilliant performance by Moss.
652,Was expecting some dark sci-fi film and got a full fledged horror film that not only kept you on the edge of your seat but had a lot of scary moments. This had great story telling and even better acting with an ending you would not expect.
653,"Yep they saved a bunch on special effects in this movie, but it far makes up for that in the suspense department, give it a go it's a solid 7/10."
654,"Honestly, I didn't have stellar expectations going to watch this. I hoped the acting would be worth the trip, but I imagined the movie itself would be just average, specially after watching that very revealing trailer. Turns out I was wrong and I kept getting surprised till the end. Sure, there are some clich√©s, plot holes and exagerations here and there, like one could wait for, but I genuinely thought it was well written and done. Though I'm not the biggest fan of these in-the-face thrillers, I'm glad I didn't skip this one."
655,"This movie lives up to all its hype! A movie that keeps you watching and waiting. Whoever did the rewrite on this did a great job. Elizabeth Moss showed us a different side of her acting abilities. This is a Movie that you will enjoy.
Just keep an eye out and follow the twist. On my own personal scale I give it a six Clydesdales out of eight. ENJOY!!"
656,"Very good. Actors, great. Story, great. You should have not shown as much in the trailer. The trailer was fantastic but it did show too much."
657,Excellent story with clever use of diversion to distract from what the audience was shown. Pretty good acting. Just enough of the cast of characters survive to allow for a sequel. Highly Recommended 8.5 !!!
658,"Cant be missed! This is a celebration of filmmaking like 1917 , joker , Parasite etc. The screenplay is topnotch and incidentally the director is also the co-writer of this lovely movie. They've worked really hard on the screenplay which keeps you glued to your seats. The direction justifies the writing , top class. A special mention needs to be made for the sound design. This movie wouldn't have impacted you if this kind of sound design including background score wasnt there. The actors are all too good but Ms. Moss has to have a standing ovation. She is stellar!! Please watch it in IMAX like I did"
659,"The idea was good and grab my attention to see it in the first day but during the show, I just regret why I am spending my time and money on this movie.
There are lots of details missing in the movie, the story still needs improvements. The woman character must play better or let's say the director should pay attention to the actress play on the scenes she is confronting with an invisible man. The part of the story which is related to the police is not developed, and has points which make no sense."
660,Absolutely great movie!! From the beginning to the end. Elisabeth Moss was great.
661,"Well, talked about an over-hyped movie. With words of its greatness and how good it was, I must admit that I was somewhat having expectations to this movie. Granted, I wasn't familiar with the plot of the movie when I sat down to watch it, I must admit that I was expecting quite something else than what this movie turned out to be.While I must say that the movie definitely was nicely acted, I must also say that I found this movie to be a pile of stinking... Well, you get my drift here. The storyline was just the most atrocious thing I have seen in a long, long time. It was such a laughable plot and storyline that it was just hard to enjoy the movie. Sure, I managed to get through it, but I wasn't entertained, nor were I enjoying what transpired on the screen.""The Invisible Man"" was just a massive swing and a miss from writer and director Leigh Whannell in terms of it being an entertaining or enjoyable movie for me to watch.The special effects in the movie were good, and the acting was good. But the movie as a whole just was rubbish.I am rating ""The Invisible Man"" a generous three out of ten stars, solely based on the acting and the effects. The script and storyline was such a massive hindrance holding back the movie for me. This is by no means a movie I will watch a second time."
662,A new twist on a classic!! I was hesitant when I heard about the remake. I'm a huge fan of the originals and hate when they trash them for a quick buck. However this took the original story and made it modern. You had the jump scares but mostly it's an intense ride of fear that keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is what modern horror should strive to be!!
663,I really liked this it was so well done. Elisabeth Moss was superd and very believable. The plot was simple but there were some cool twists along the way. Luckily there were only few jump scares. It was intensive movie with great acting and pacing. Two hours went really fast.
664,"The Invisible Man (1933) is one of my favourite classic Universal horrors, so any reimagining/remake/revision/regurgitation already had its work cut out trying to convince me of its worthiness. But hey, director Leigh Whannell impressed me greatly with action/sci-fi Upgrade (2018), so I was willing to give him a fair crack of the whip.What helped to make the original film so compelling was seeing how meddling with science and absolute power corrupted the mind, resulting in madness and violence. In Whannell's version of the story, scientist Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) is already a controlling sociopath way before becoming invisible, physically and mentally abusing his partner Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss). No longer a study of insanity brought on by an iffy serum and freedom from moral constraints (something that even Verhoeven's Hollow Man adhered to), this updated tale is little more than a slick thriller with lots of atmosphere and a few effective special effects sequences, but marred by quite a lot of glaring plot-holes.Whannell's film sees Cecilia convinced that she is still being stalked and abused by Adrian, even after his supposed suicide (apparently the only person to see his body was his brother - no coroner, no police, no other concerned relatives), and yet she does little to protect herself or gather proof to corroborate her theory (tazer, mace, video footage). She eventually confirms her suspicions by splashing her invisible assailant with watery paint from a tin stored 'sans lid' in her attic, and yet the paint somehow disappears, allowing him to escape.When Cecilia finds the high-tech invisibility suit (with added super-strength powers) in Adrian's laboratory, she stashes it in a hidey-hole, instead of immediately calling the police so that she can prove her sanity ('cos doing the sensible thing would bring the film to an end way too soon). The twist where Adrian is found bound and sealed up in a hidden room is never adequately explained: are we supposed to believe that his brother did this at his behest, no questions asked? Or did he somehow do it himself? Either way, it's highly unlikely.The very ending, in which Cecilia retrieves the suit that she should have shown to the police earlier and uses it to get rid of Adrian once and for all, is too far-fetched, with her cop friend James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) happy to ignore the fact that she has just cut a man's throat with a carving knife.Whannell's direction is assured, with a few standout sequences (the invisible man attacking Cecilia in the kitchen, the death of Cecila's sister, Cecilia's escape from the secure facility), and the performances are all fine, but it is the film's numerous dubious plot points that are it's major shortcomings.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for the juicy throat slashings."
665,"Wow ! #ucking hell ! Where do I start from ? Absolutely brilliant movie.Try not to laugh at me but ....this movie had to be a contender for best movie of 2020. Absolutely brilliant.You're spoilt for choice from acting, scripts to storyline."
666,This movie surprised me by how good and suspenseful it was. The reviewers that say it's boring must've been watching a different movie than me because those 2 hours flew by. After being let down by Fantasy Island and Brahms the Boy 2 I had little hope for an actual decent horror movie to come out this year but rest assure this movie was great and at the moment is the best horror movie of the year!
667,"Don't waste your time and watch something else. No plot, nothing .."
668,"This is a very modern 2020 version, nothing like anything seen before. A gripping thriller *ring Elisabeth Moss aka 'Zoey Bartlet' (of The West Wing) in the lead role. Shot in NSW, Australia."
669,I was hearing so much this movie The Invisible Man I just had to witness. I love horror movies and was ready to be scared pant off.So Cecilia is escaping from her evil boyfriend his gizmo palace. This bit was good but then he wakes up and finds her (in the wood?!) and punches her car. So unbelievable her friend just asks why he punches instead of driving. Don't you want insurance claim!Rest of the film is Cecilia going crazy cause he is invisible now or maybe not. She burns the eggs (why this scene?) and slaps her friends. How can she see all the time if he is invisible????Then the film turns into John Wick and he use mad skills to shoot his enemies. Then there is mega twist that no one needed then why when the film was already over. They call this super classic?!!!!The acting is dumb. All the characters are just saying their lines. Why did her friend leave her in his house when we know she dangerous (eggs!)Avoid this like it was invisible! It is cliche with no horror (Where is my shock!?)
670,"Stretched, unconvincing, predictable .. Spent two hours of his life for an extremely bad movie. I don't know how he got rates higher than 1"
671,"This is one of the worst movies I've watched in every sense, I wasted my time watching it. It's terribly uninteresting and boring, already seen, no action, no excitement."
672,This was a half way decent movie up until he killed her sister and then dropped the knife in her hand. Then the hospital scene where he kept taking out security guards. This should have been a made for TV movie.
673,"Elizabeth Moss plays the lead in this superb thriller .And the film has suspense right up until the end .
The people putting these negatives reviews, can't have seen a good movie in their lives .Just twisted for me with the 1s and 2s .Shower of idiots
Watch it .You will not be disappointed"
674,"So Surprised why sooo many bad review ? That proves Still many dumb people exisit whose can hate any good movie ,Movie was sooo good & engaging ,Intense i was whole time more Scared then real Ghost type horror movies,yes movie was bit long which make it Cliche can be 20 minute cut & short which can make movie truly masterpiece, but overall was good movie with quite scary elements."
675,"There are no word to describe how stupid this movie is. First rich guy and he choose to be with someone way below is league. Invents a suite that can make him millions but only uses it to get his ex back? The girl is very dumb, he is invisible so how is hiding doing you any good?? She has him cornered several times but let's him go cause she all of a sudden gets scared?? So stupid. This movie should have ended within the first 3 mins but no, we continue on for the enjoy of more stupid people being stupid.If you understand logic, do not watch this movie. Waste of time and almost half of the scenes on this show was unneeded."
676,"I thought this movie same as old movie and the book,but after watching this movie I realise that this is a Different concept.
Cinematography and Acting is Great.
I like to see a Part two,"
677,"Maybe okay watching one time, but has very little rewatchability. Went in with no expectations and the beginning wasn't too terrible, but the plot holes kept adding up. Lack of character development and too much telling instead of showing. Hardly evening scary for a horror film."
678,"Elisabeth Moss, the ""Queen of peak TV"", has had herself a consistent line of roles in well-received film and on the small screen. Deservedly so, and she continues that for Leigh Whannel's The Invisible Man- An ambitious Psychological Horror that deserves to be ranked among the recent likes of Hereditary, Midsommar and A Quiet Place. Its cinematography, editing and lack of reliance of jump scares are remarkable; Aldis Hodge, Michael Dorman are terrific in terms of cast along with Oliver Jackson-Cohen's antagonist is chillingly real even though he ramps up in science-fiction abilities (or does he?).Under the guise of being a winter scare-coaster, it's more so a timely testament on the terror of domestic violence and the need for women to be believed and saved in the most dire of circumstances. Elevated Horror has been given a lot of proper due this past half-decade, and I'd be more than happy to see this dignitary installment receive a follow-up of some sort.
Grade- A/3.5 out of 4 stars."
679,"As a viewer you should judge for yourself, however imho this movie is not worth the credits.There were a few good scenes, but that is very poor for a film that lasts 2 hrs... the acting is not bad, but also not memorable.The angle chosen to explain the story is alright, but as a psychological thriller the biggest flaw of this piece is that it just does not have any tension to keep the viewer in his seat and hold his attention."
680,"People can be overly critical. True, the Invisible Man could easily be compared to Hollow Man. My way of looking at it is that now we have more than one modern movie about a crisis brought on by a genius secret formula. I think the lead being so well known for The Handmaid's Tale may have overshadowed expectations here. Again, the way to look at it, to my mind, is that now we have yet another great future vision of a woman in crisis. The Invisible Man is a very clever movie idea with some interesting visual effects and buckets of suspense."
681,"Wow what a pleasant surprise this movie was!!! I did expect it to be that damn good but it was & i loved it.
This film is expertly crafted for suspenseful thrills & exciting bursts of action & violence that is shocking.Elizabeth Moss is fantastic, i mean a magnificent performance!!! Moss delivers everything perfectly for her damaged role as tormented & mentally tortured CECILIA, she's a victim of real abuse that many suffer from in real life & here she hammers the part greatly with a sense of lost soul in her sad & weary eyes but she's still one tough lady when she's had enough.
This is a suspenseful Thriller with a little mix of science fiction, it's a great ride & one i will watch many more times. Cecilia escapes one night from her horrible relationship with her psycho control freak boyfriend & hides out in a nice suburban neighbourhood with a friend & her sister but of course there's some twists & turns & He finds her under stealth Invisibility (It's nothing Corny or Cheesy believe me) & he torments her new life & everyone around her. There's so many incredible moments & scenes it just has to be seen.
An incredibly well made Suspense Thriller with an excellent standout performance from Elizabeth Moss & some stunning special effects moments & a story that is actually drenched in reality (except for the invisible stuff) but all in all this is one of the best & most entertaining movies in along time that is actually unpredictable & exciting.
At times this is actually scary & the sequence in the rain is fantastic!!!"
682,"It's a great film. I lt ooks great, the acting is great, it grips, there are twists and turns galore and you really care about Cecilia. That was my experience of this terrific movie. I cannot imagine why some people are giving this 1/10 or what their motivations are. I've seen some stinkers in my time and this surely isn't one of them. I'd only advise not to watch the trailers - they give way too much away. Come to it blind, suspend your disbelief and enjoy the roller coaster ride. One of the best films I've seen in ages without doubt 8/10."
683,"This movie is well-shot, well- edited, and well-acted. It's a sci fi version of ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" except Elizabeth Moss gives a more nuanced and intense performance than what Julia Roberts did in that movie. The ending is quite satisfying. Not familiar with Invisible Man powers exactly, I wondered the whole time what kind of superhero is this that uses his power merely for sinister purposes specifically aimed at one person. It should be the opposite. Well the ending gave us the answer with Cecilia's redemption and then took it to the next level that it would of course take a woman to use super powers for the good of the world as it should be. The Invisible Man is bad, but the good Invisible Man is actually a woman!"
684,"This is demining Victorian rubbish that teach women not to be Humans. I thought cult of female victimhood is over beaten by self awareness, Police protection, Judges or simple self defence.
In Real life she would get 50% of his estate in the court of law or bash his teeth out with baseball but.
But with this film we are back to Weak inferiority of woman. This Sexist crap should be banned."
685,"Story, visual effect almost everything is very bad. I watched it to the end. Just a waste of time. It's really bad. Don't be fooled by your score."
686,"I love the campy monster movies, but you will find little connection to the original here. What it lacks in nostalgia it makes up for with a clever, modern story that is chilling, suspenseful and thoroughly satisfying. Elizabeth Moss was great, and you feel her pain. It's too bad they didn't make the eponymous villain worthy of sympathy (like in the original), but Moss's character certainly earns your sympathy, and probably hits a bit close to home for those who've been in possessive relationships. But her ending is satisfying. Please be a sequel!"
687,"The only really abused human here is the viewer. Invisible in this story was the protagonist's slide into mental anguish she displayed too early. The lame attempt of a final twist was so diaphanous as to be completely see through, as well. What a waste of time."
688,"I'm a big fan of horror and thriller films and I was honestly on the fence whether this would be worth the time but the fact that I watched it last night and plan on watching it again tonight means it was a very interesting movie. The only other place I'm familiar with Moss was Girl, Interrupted and Us. She absolutely killed it in the lead role. Seeing her emotional response to an abusive relationship and the fear of her husbands return mixed in with questioning her own sanity or admitting her husband was invisible. Playing off of the scary element in the move when you can't see it took some great acting in my opinion. You genuinely fear for her and want her to come out on top. Definitely worth a watch, or two."
689,"Imagine a generic, feminist comic book ripoff, where the main characters fight an invisible enemy! They punch and kick into the air to no avail, and try to defend themselves from the enemy that may or may not be there. Literally a movie where you can't see the antagonist. So many awkward scenes where characters are desperately trying to act against something that isn't there. Then the second half, things only get more cringe!That's this movie, folks. Do NOT waste your time. Also, judging by the last scene I actually believe they are going to make a sequel titled the Invisible Woman! Definitely count me out on this crapper of a series."
690,"Didn't hate it completely, but I do feel like I would've been better off not bothering to watch it."
691,"This movie has a few issues: the pace is ridiculously slow, the plot is ridiculous, and the ending is ridiculously predictable. In summary, it is ridiculous. Pre-teens would enjoy the movie because there are jump scares without it being over the top gory. So, I give it 4 stars because it is a good sleepover movie, and it may make young teen girls think twice about narcissistic men they might meet in the future. Adults, do not waste your time. Hopefully, you do not need a lesson in narcissist individuals, and if you do, then it's too late for you anyway."
692,"I am sometimes amused by overly critical reviews, as if it earns you some kind of intellectual trophy. The general point of the movies is entertainment. This movie is entertaining, not perfect, but still entertaining. Many remakes of this H.G. Wells Story vary little. This version is updated with new technology possibilities. My whole family enjoyed it."
693,"I will say this, you will like the movie for what it does well, and that the tension of not knowing where the invisible man is, but on the other hand, it was convoluted due to all the technical and plot issues.-she drugged him with her own pills? she kept saying he knew her every move? yet still wakes up to randomly punch the passenger window of a car? ok sure its a movie and we saw a bunch of weird stuff in the basement, ill let it slide.-when the girl get hit and thrown to the ground by the sheer force of the hit, there no way anyone would a been ""you hit me"" from 2-3 feet away that was a hard hit, ok maybe she was dazed ill give them that.now the real head scratchers-she meets her sister in a high class public restaurant, yeah sure not a single camera from every angle, not a single jail scene, nor did she even go to court, straight into the loony bin...-when she finds the suite in the basement, the suite makes so much damn noise when uncloaking that it makes no damn sense that the suite would not make any noise in the first 2/3 of the movie, not to mention anyone wearing this would die of a heat stroke in like 4-5 min from your own heat and sweat.-hides the suite for her to use it like a gotcha moment, making me think she planned the whole thing because she did the suites and manipulated the jelly fish brother, as she watches him die, she says surprise like a damn psychopath.it was a good watch till you finish the movie and think about the the actual plot."
694,"The guy is invisible, not a superhero. A bit unrealistic. Felt very B grade."
695,Best Dialogue of the movie - You are the jellyfish version of him.
696,A ''real'' explaination about how a human can be invisible
697,"Till the one third of the movie me and my girl were on the edge, excited. Yet some huge plot holes and unnecessary twist ruined it for us. And the ending, so predictable, so amateur... just 5 for the 1/3 of it."
698,"One of the best films Iv seen this year, highly recommend"
699,"For anyone settling down to watch a good science-fiction picture or possibly a picture based on the H.G. Wells novel; he or she is going to be bitterly disappointed.Basically this picture is a murder mystery bordering on the thriller category. A lot of it is implausible requiring one to suspend disbelief. There is some degree of alluding to an ""invisible man"" but he has very little to do and is really only incidental to the film.I believe Universal is currently re-making their old horror-monster pictures and I tremble at the thought of what they will make of the rest? Will ""The Phantom of the Opera"" consist of someone playing a gramophone recording of Christine Daae singing? Will ""The Wolfman"" be a rabid dog? Will ""Frankenstein"" be made from Lego? The mind boggles..."
700,Story with many holes. Just stupid. Waste of your time. Better to go to sleep.
701,"People nowadays just want cheap thrills and dumb jump scares.
This movie doesn't do that, it builds the tension from the beginning and doesn't let go.
The way Whannell positions his thriller is really well crafted, you do feel a clear animosity for the villain and pity/hope for Moss's character.Leigh Whannell is getting better as his craft with every new entry."
702,"Wasnt sure about this one as my genre preference does not include science fiction. However gave it a go and pleasantly surprised. Great acting, eerie psychological scary. Enjoyed it"
703,"I had 0 expectations going into this film and I have to say it's not too bad.The ending, I personally don't enjoy endings where you have to draw your own conclusions. This film did this, I understand people prefer this method but I do not. I felt the final 30 mins as well felt a little dragged out. You think it's about to end and boom! Another 10 mins and so on. I felt the reveal of the ""invisible man"" was also far too soon and it eliminated a good part of the thriller aspect of the film.Overall though, good acting, likeable characters and the plot in itself was good. It's worth watching in my opinion and the negatives don't take too much away from it."
704,"All the raving reviews makes me think people are new to this type of flick....this is such a predictable and typical story line...
Create an invisible threat and all of a sudden it's superhuman.I really have a hard time with this type of writing, the lack of common sense or articulation of the lead character to communicate to the other characters, is mindbogglingly insulting to ones intelligence.
I get it, its not real life, its the movies, and entertainment, but lets not forget they are writing it to convince the viewer that it is in a ""realish"" setting, meaning the presumption is that this is plausible.In today's day and age there are cameras everywhere, proving innocents is incredibly easy, also when something bad happens to a person and the other person is 4 ft away, blaming that person is not realistic.
Especially in a public area like a hospital or a police station or even a restaurant there would be a multitude of cameras that would show odd but easily provable things.As mentioned above, I don't get the incredible superhuman strength that seems to be present, to overtake a large contingent of folks, yeah-no!I just completed it while writing this review and the ending bumped it up 1 star, but all in all it was a typical run of the mill physiological cat and mouse type of thing that makes a person say, oh geez whats next...if thats your bag of balls then go for it, but if you expected more, I would say you better prepare yourself for a rehash of pretty much every psychological thriller ever made.Side thought...what a waste of a great premise!"
705,"Invisible Man (2020)
Invisible Man is a 2020 horror film directed by Leigh Whanell and starring Elizabeth Moss, Aldis Hodge and Oliver Jackson Cohen.This is a really good film, when I first watched the trailer I wasn't particularly excited, it honestly just looked like a mediocre horror film but this turned out to be great. It's incredibly suspenseful especialy in the outstanding first scene that gets us on edge right at the beginning of the fim and also later on when Cee is left alone in the house after Adrian hits Sydney.The acting is pretty good and I really like Elizabeth Moss as Cecilia, even though her career has had a boom recently this is honestly the only film I have seen with her.Finally I absolutely love the futuristic set design, particularly in Adrian's mansion.7.6/10"
706,"I had my reservations about watching ""The Invisible Man"", because it was made by Leigh Whannell, who is at least partially responsible for those stupid, endless Saw movies, and the equally stupid but less original ""Insidious"".Those movies were technically sound, but artistically bereft, and unfortunately, ""The Invisible Man"" isn't that much of a departure. It seems to be going for the unbearable slow-burn that Ari Aster has perfected, but doesn't get there.The movie really comes alive in the second half, with some genuinely surprising moments, showing it would have worked better with more action.The movie also tries to make a serious statement, or at least have a serious real-world theme, with its intimations of domestic violence, and the struggle of a woman trying to escape this situation. I guess Jordan Peele, who showed that serious contemporary issues can have a place in supernatural fiction, was the movie's other inspiration. However this is handled clumsily here, and it seems like the movie only remembers its social conscience right at the end, after intimating it an hour or so previously, when the movie comes to an underwhelming conclusion that I suppose would have made Andrea Dworkin proud. The fact that this theme culminates in a lame conclusion tells us it was an uneasy fit for the movie's story."
707,"It's a shame that this film wasn't as good as it could and should have been. As lots of reviewers have pointed out there a huge plot holes that you just can't ignore. It seems like the script was lazily edited and the actors didn't really care and just went along for the ride. Sure, it's creepy and has its moments, but overall it's just not very good. Lower your expectations and it may work for you."
708,"Without giving away any spoilers, suffice it to say that this movie was too unbelievable and too illogical to be entertaining."
709,"Despite good premise, the film falls apart quickly. Somehow the invisible suit makes someone seem like a superhero, giving them lightning speed and fighting skills. This is never explained as are many of the plot holes documented by other reviewers. Already overlong, the ending seems tacked on and makes no sense. I feel i lost a few brain cells watching this clunky set piece. Take a pass on this one if you want avoid bad films."
710,Disgusting film. Just more from Hollywood trying to shove down our throats this lie that women are all victims of (white) men.
711,"Silence is film's blank canvass, the space on which much can be drawn with only the most delicate of strokes. Elisabeth Moss is - as I've said repeatedly, probably to the boredom of many - one of those rare performers who can exploit silence with great power; she thrives on suggestion and allusion - what's sometimes referred to as show, don't tell, film-making. In an episode of The Handmaid's Tale, she gets to do this for the episode's full running-time - alone in a deserted and isolated house, on the cusp of going into labour, trying to formulate an escape. It's a hypnotic, frightening, unbearably tense and ultimately deeply moving hour of television which it's hard to imagine any other actress pulling off.It's precisely this episode of television that sits at the forefront of my mind whilst watching The Invisible Man - an updating and reimagining of H.G. Wells' seminal 1897 novel which looms in the popular imagination of so many who have never read it or seen a previous adaptation. The novel is recontextualised into 2020, with Elisabeth Moss as the victim of concerted domestic violence, who seemingly continues to be haunted by her invisible, supposedly deceased, abuser. It remains a science-fiction/horror thriller, but like the original text it deals with the big issues of the moment - in the shadow of the Trump Presidency that becomes the #Metoo experience, gaslighting and victim-blaming.There are many silences and apparently empty spaces to fill with fear, the threat of violence and self-doubt here. Moss - and director Leigh Whannell - exploit them fully. Moss briefly exits the kitchen, leaving a pan of bacon frying - a pan which sits on the edge of the frame allowing us to watch the mundane scene; is it just our imagination, or does the heat on the pan go up (a question that nods to the gaslighting abuse victims experience)? Either way, Moss is scared out of her mind when she returns to the room. Many scenes involve Moss silently stalking or being stalked by her invisible abuser - or is she hysterical? - and the emphasis on her breathless anxiety is visceral and startling. All of us have at some point been alone in a house at night and been startled or shaken by creaks and groans; all of us will find it easy to think ourselves into Moss's shoes in her moments of isolation, dread and violence.The first hour is all about establishing the premise and the relationships; the second is the pay-off. Some may find the film's second-half a step-down, maybe too generic; for me, that would be to misunderstand the purpose of good genre film-making and to deny the audience and film-makers what they all earn by way of catharsis. Good genre film-making exploits (and occasionally subverts) the rules and expectations of the genre in order to both satisfy the audience to a greater or lesser degree and also to smuggle in some bigger issues which demand attention, slipping under the skin of the viewer's consciousness to bubble to the surface later. It's a trick as old as art of all kinds, and this film stands healthily and proudly in that tradition.Some will object to a film that aims as much for visceral thrills as it does the big issues it addresses; that is understandable. A victim of intimate partner abuse - especially one for whom the abuse is ongoing or recent - may well find it too triggering and real; or they may just find it a source of some kind of hope. As a victim of such abuse myself, many years ago now, it felt real, appropriate and thrillingly entertaining as well as a stark reminder of latent fears that never quite leave someone who's experienced this type of abuse alone. Those of us gaslit, exploited, bullied, physically and sexually abused by intimate partners (or anyone in a position of power over us) will see ourselves in Moss's character; it's not a film that some of us will watch lightly. But for many there is entertainment, and much more besides, to engage with here - which makes this the very best sort of genre thriller."
712,"Let's just start with Elizabeth moss, a great actor that can captivate the audience and keep them focused for some scenes where she's just talking to what she thinks is Adrian, but may just me her alone in the room. Cinematography was great and the blend of colours and m sets worked great, especially the dinner scene between Cecilia and her sister, which gave the audience a big and unsuspecting surprise which gave great reactions. Like most people say, the trailer supposedly gave the film away in terms of the ending, but I'm not a person who watches trailers as I like to be surprised with a film and go in with an open mind. If you think the trailer spoils the movie, the trailer doesn't do any justice to the great film that this is."
713,Very bad movie...Full of plots holes and no character development. 4th act destroys any credibility remaining in this absurd mess of a movie.
714,"A film that brings the feature title in to the 21st century.
Rather than it being the human who goes invisible, it is a suit that makes the purfect disguise.However, though the original idea was reinvented with a technical twist, the writing of the story was left lagging in its wake.I feel there are more holes in this story than there is plot, which starts from the very beginning where Cecilia runs for her life with no explanation.Whilst you can excuse the introduction as a director allowing your imagination to fill in the gaps, there was no back story of the characters for you to engage in. This continued throughout the next for scenes as the story unfolded new characters to the fold.Whilst the film leaves you to consider the girl is a little unhinged, the almost poltergeist endeavours begin which is where the totally unbelievable events start.Example.... Cecilia sits down with another girl, the daughter of the cop she is staying with. The other girl gets slapped in the face, which is suggested Cecilia did. Yet the girl was clearly sitting in front of her, sees she made no move.... yet blamed her by not saying anything to her dad.....She didnt question the fact she was hit by an invisible force. She didnt acknowledge Cecilia didnt touch her. It went undiscussed. The daughter may have been in shock, but really....?After this she drives all the way to the house where the story started. This is some miles away over the Golden Gate bridge.She does to the suit ""which is hanging up'. Takes it, and proceeds to hide it whilst the invisible man has managed to follow her, undetected, to the house. Did he fly? How did he know she was going there? And why, when she was being chased around the house, did she hide the suit..... surely you would put it on to leave the building undetected? Further more, nobody believed she was telling the truth about the invisible man.... So she said in the following scenes she had something to show them.... another hole.... why didnt she just take it to show them? Bonkers.....Then there was the restaurant scene. A huge knife which cant be hidden inside a skin tight suit that can only be taken off from the back, appears in front of Cecilia and her sister which proceeds to slice the sisters throat and placed in to Cecilia's hand.
Like Cecilia would have sat there and watched it happen.... let alone have the knife placed in to her hand.I could go on..... but I wont. The film has sapped my energy.If you see this on your TV planner, please choose a different channel and save 2 hours of your life."
715,"I thought the high rating here could work for a solid thriller but it's one you won't talk about next day. If you don't take all seriously you can spend an entertaining time but if not stay away.
The created atmosphere developed suspense and and the camera view was creepy. The main actress made a good job. 6/10.
If you like films of this genre check out the Hollow Man with Kevin Bacon."
716,"Don't bother, it's a very boring movie! The only reason I watched the entire movie is because I was hoping it would get better! Nope!"
717,So many things. Who leaves paint in their attic with the top off of it? Why did the cop leave his own house with his daughter after the slap instead of throwing her out? Why didn't she get her own place with that money? She needed to be prettier if he was the type of rich guy they were going for. I only made it half way through and cut it off. I'm curious if they explain how he faked his murder
718,"This movie has plot holes. Let's get past that. Some of them are forgivable. Some of them ruined the story. Although some people are saying that having the element of surprise could give a person enough leverage to lift an average sized grown woman (way) off the floor and toss her across the room like a rag doll.....I'm calling B.S. No offense to the main actress, but she was not a rake thin supermodel. (No disrespect. I'm just saying).The main thing that ruined this movie for me is the (lack of) character development. I'm really suppose to hate the husband....right? But we mostly know about him through second hand accounts and actions of the wife. Obviously, she is terrified of him. OK. However, we don't really meet him before his ""death"" (with the exception of him putting his hand through the car to get to his wife). As a result, it was hard to truly feel bad for the wife.Actually, I started to feel bad for the wife, but after the illogical nonsense of the script, I gave up. As the story slogged on, I was hoping that the wife would either win or lose. Pick one and end the movie.The science seemed wacky, but since we never properly saw a backstory of the husband, I guess the scriptwriter just slapped in whatever it took to fill the page count quota.Ugh. This could have been better."
719,"I like Leigh Whannell so I really wanted to like this movie, but I just didn't.The concept of the movie is really interesting which is why I gave a 3 instead of even lower.The acting was not great and I found the main character very unlikable.There were a couple of surprises here and there but overall the ending was predictable from about the midpoint of the movie.For those above reasons, I just didn't find it enjoyable. Oh well."
720,"So this is it, huh? This movie is about... an invisibility suit. That's really it. No deeper meaning to the ""invisible man."" It really was about an invisibility suit. Literally- the invisibility cloak from Harry Potter. Not a journey about a woman learning to cope with a past abusive relationship. Not a story about the memory of loss driving a woman insane. It's about an invisibility suit. Jesus.The only thing that stops this from being a total dumper fire is great acting from the entire ensemble. Avoid IMO."
721,"Well most of the plot holes can be explained that nobody has ever seen an invisible man before. I mean without giving anything away, if you feel that yeah right that can happen.. just think if that can happen considering no person knows that invisibility exists and it'll start making more sense.I loved the movie. It was a far better movie than my last watch (baby driver.. yuck)"
722,"I didn't finish the movie when seeing it for the first time. The second time I made it and it turned out pretty good. Parts of the scenes are not logical at all (for instance, those cops in the mental hospital are surprisingly weak. Almost like one punch can knock him off.) but there is a twist at the end which is not obvious to foresee. The mental status of C is also interesting. She is not crazy but her plan definitely ruins certain relationships. One thing that the movie did not explain well but definitely could strengthen the craziness of A is how manipulative A is."
723,"Warning SpoilersThis movie starts out slow but it shows its potential early. However unfortunately it does not hold up. There are so many instances where she could have gotten better results so much more quickly, mainly by using her cell phone. Why does everyone else have a cell phone except for her? In the attic she could've taken his phone and the keys and gone to the police. She could have recorded him many times and then take the footage to the police. It's unfortunate that it wasn't a smarter movie because it had potential. Most disappointing is what she does at the end. It would have been nice to see him get bested in a different way."
724,"The many plot holes and stupidity of the heroine allowing those close to her to be hurt and even killed are much discussed in other reviews so I won't bother.
When I first saw the dog's food bowl with the name 'Zeus' on it, I envisioned a devil dog, a terrifying accomplice to his abusive master. But moments later we meet a sweet pup that wants to leave his hellish abode with his mommy.
However she takes his shock collar and then, just leaves him there? With the cruel husband she just drugged and is running away from? Who does that? Couldn't the sister have taken the dog to a shelter?
I was relieved to see him alive and well later (how?) but her initial action turned me against Celia and had me rooting against her for most of the movie. The right people died at the end though, including her sister who must be one of the grating characters I've seen in a long time.
It was visually well done and watchable if you have a couple hours to kill."
725,"The movie is really good. It manages to keep you interested all the time. Elisabeth Moss delivers, as usual, a superb performance. From my point of view, this woman is really one of the greatest actresses of her generation.The story is just ok. Of course, it is not new, but one would expect it to either remain true to the original or bring some new interesting twists. This movie gives none of those. It is a good movie, based on the same idea of being invisible, but that's about all it has in common with the original one.It is a stalker thriller, a bit like Sleeping with the enemy but the enemy has an invisible suit. It feels like the movie just explored the surface of the invisibility topic. And being it a property of a suit (instead of being himself invisible) makes it less interesting to explore. There is no purpose or personal conflict with the invisibility, just a means to stalk. In the original movie, the guy is looking for the antidote, as being invisible all the time brings some good, but many bad, situations.The movie focuses on her rather than on ""The invisible man"", which considering Elisabeth's performance is not such a bad idea, but at some point you may be wondering whether the invisible suit does not only make you invisible but also mute.Overall, it is a good thriller, with great acting, good soundtrack, directing, editing and not a bad ending, but it won't leave you thinking much by the end. A bit like having a very well cooked but medium to low quality steak.Nonetheless, it is very well cooked, so I do recommend you watch this movie."
726,"This film was a disappointment. While the action scenes were great, the storyline is terrible. Tons of questions instantly come to mind like: Why are there no cameras in restaurant? How did the dog survive being in the empty house alone for so long and why was he left alone in the first place? There's plenty more, but they'd go into spoiler territory. Anyway this film plays it too safe. Simple twists, no loose ends. Just mediocre."
727,"The invisible man not only shows himself to be a very competent film, but he also shows himself to be a film very different from the original,
while in its original 1933 ""The invisible man"" is a sci-fi / horror, in this remake, the film proposes to be more of a horror thriller, a mixture that works much better by the way.What stands out is the choice of the protagonist, Elisabeth Moss was undoubtedly the best choice for this film, in addition to delivering a sensational performance, she still manages to fit perfectly in the role of ""crazy"" victim being chased by a psychopath.The invisible man is able to explore the camera angles and their positions in strategic places, with the camera always prioritizing long-distance shots, or even those that have ""nothing"", to generate the effect of doubt.
something like..
He is there?
where is he?
Because it is invisible, its ""appearance"" is done in a well planned and creative way.Something I believe the film wasted, I believe it is the ""Doubt of the viewer""
for example...
It would be much more interesting if, instead of knowing that there really is an invisible man, we were embarking on this doubt together with the characters, something to think about, ""is there really someone invisible, or is this woman going crazy?""
I feel like I would look great in this film, although I love what was shown to us in the film.
Another controversy of mine was about the ending ...
Did the movie really need this?
: /
my only negative point,
that ending ...
did the movie really need it?
Did it have to be like this?
Seriously?
This ending can be impressive and disappointing at the same time."
728,From the director is professional man but the sound effects is not good take this example she was standing in the living room I here sound fire but I never see the fire the project has I small details I don't see it
729,I had high hopes for this movie but it fell short in many ways. I love suspense thrillers but this one left me confused & wanting. Too many plot holes & just overall unrealistic. Invisibility is such an old & very cool concept however I see none of the mystery or education in this movie. Oh well!
730,It's not bad but somehow doesn't seem to succeed the level of an average t.v. movie.
731,"This is just a great thriller, nothing more, nothing less.I liked it, storywise, acting and effects.It's a fun watch for sure."
732,"On its surface, ""The Invisible Man"" looks like an intelligent and sophisticated thriller. It's not that the movie isn't either of those things, but much like the actual ""invisible man"" in the film, it's not quite what it seems. You're lured in by a fantastic opening sequence, punctuated with a lush score and thrilling sound design. Each shot is meticulous, and the film overall looks sleek and expensive. All of these elements, though, mask some shortcomings at play like plot holes, strange narrative turns and, at times, slightly cringey dialogue.The most successful element of the film is Elisabeth Moss's performance. She embodies Cecilia completely, and is able to push to extremes without ever taking it over the top. She grounds Cecilia so that you're with her every step of the way, no matter how crazy the journey gets. While not a perfect film, this is an incredibly entertaining watch and I would definitely recommend checking it out."
733,"Movie's starting one hour was unnecessarily stretched and boring. It is only in last 45 minutes when movie becomes some interesting. This is a horror movie just difference is that they are trying to scare you by moving camera here and there. Well, the idea was nice but execution needed to be better. The pace of the movie was also a problem, first of all this movie didn't need to be 2hour movie. 1hr30 min (max) was enough for this type of story.I was really excited for this after seeing all the reviews but after watching it, I don't think it deserved so much rating. Overall, would say that you can give it a try but don't expect too much.."
734,I knew the ending to the film by the first half. I still loved it and recommend to anybody who loves a Friday night scare fest.
735,"A very good revamp with original concepts unique to the current age of digital tech and cyber control. Has thoughtful concepts of spousal psychological abuse. Instills terror with adept cinematic lingering shots creating suspense.Lacks certain kinds of conviction and perhaps not the best cast. Certain aspects question believability, particularly with the cop and the suit. I understand the protagonist's character arc but that suit really needed to be kept under better watch.Even so, a haunting look at the kind of superpower that would fall into the wrong hands, and why it's better for such tech not to be made."
736,"This ""Invisible Man"" isn't the old H.G. Well's dude with the bandages, gloves and dark glasses. There's nothing yesterday about this story, it's right up to the minute. ""The Invisible Man"" has been around the block a few times over the years, but this outing gives him a whole new lease of life.Director, screenwriter, Leigh Whannell, has taken mundane, everyday locations like a suburban house, a restaurant and a hospital corridor and produced one of the scariest movies in a long time. He also gets the most out of a high-tech clifftop house, reminiscent of Vandamm's clifftop residence in Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"".For a while, we aren't sure if Elizabeth Moss' Cecilia Kass is imagining that her supposedly dead, abusive, optics guru husband is stalking her as an invisible man, or if it's all just in her head? ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Woman in the Fifth"" plus a few other movies come to mind.Elizabeth Moss gives an incredible performance as someone who could be schizophrenic or at the least suffering from paranoid delusions. The scene where she gets hold of a fountain pen in her cell is hard to watch.Now for me, I think the first three quarters of the film was the best where we still don't know which way it's heading. When the invisible becomes more visible though, I think Leigh Whannell took his foot off the gas. He had the choice of keeping the whole thing pretty ambiguous or going for a more concrete resolution. I would have opted for keeping us guessing. However, ""The Invisible Man"" is definitely a classy effort.Like some of the most memorable scary movies, the best effect is sometimes the one we aren't shown, and the film relishes every dark corner and every empty room where our imaginations seem to create the action. The unsettling score by Benjamin Wallfisch that goes from serene to searing keeps us on edge even when nothing graphic is shown. The special effects are effective, but aren't the key ingredient.Most of the film was shot in Australia, some of it just down the road from where I live. Maybe the feeling that the locale is hard to place adds to the film's atmosphere. It looks like a sequel is planned, but it will be hard to beat the innovative touches in this one."
737,Has you second guessing at every point. Is he dead and haunting her? Is he alive and has some special invisibility suit? Well worth a watch.
738,"The first half of the film is gripping and engaging. The opening alone is a small masterpiece. Not for a classic popcorn evening, but deep enough to be thought provoking and entertaining. The second half of the film is then unfortunately lost in far too many side stories and thus loses its flow. All in all a solid, good movie, but it's gotten way too long."
739,"This movie really surprised me. I had pretty low expectations when going in to this film, main reason being - is that the trailer (I thought) revealed too much of the film - and what I saw through the trailer ; I had viewed through a lens of cheesiness that blumhouse films are notorious for making. The overall premise of the movie seems silly if directed poorly. I hadn't seen Leigh Whannell's previous works the time I watched this, so I didn't know his overall talent so it came as a shock to me that I loved the movie so much. Despite a couple of plot holes in the story I won't get into, I really enjoyed his directing a lot. The tension created by the panning shots really helped establish that overall feeling that someone is watching and sense of paranoia that the main character, Cecelia (Elisabeth Moss) feels. I really recommend it to people, and to everyone that seemed turned off when viewing the trailer first I say give it chance, you won't be disappointed. You'll get a great performance from Elisabeth Moss, some amazing shots, great suspense and great action/fight scenes towards the latter half of the film. Has a pretty satisfying ending! All in all 9/10 for me!"
740,"This film was enjoyable and eery, it kept me at the edge of my seat throughout but I guessed who it was rather easily. However, some mistakes can not go by unnoticed- I mean when Adrian slits Cecilias' sisters throat in a very public place wasnt realistic, as nobody seemed to see that the knife was floating and the cameras didn't pick it up either, and it made it lose its umph, somebody would have noticed. Then the ending was a massive let down, I loved the concept of her killing him, but the timing seemed awfully off, so she'd have to leave the room, put on the invisibility suit, go over to Adrian, slit his throat, then somehow manage to go back to the bedroom to get changed out of it and pretend to be shocked by him dying- this all somehow happened during a 10 second period. It's simply unrealistic so much so I thought someone else was wearing the suit and slit his throat, which would have been a much better ending, but she managed to do it all. If it was dragged out and realistic this film easily would have gotten a 9/10 but because of the timing it really ruined it for me."
741,"It is kind of sick twisted version but not as good as hollow man made in 2000, which was better. If you like Elizabeth Moss then this is your film, but other than her there's no one else famous that in this. The story is quite futuristic with a suit with technology that makes uses invisible similar to predator movie in 1987."
742,"You can't complain really about this movie. At heart it's an updated revision of the much repeated ""Invisible Man"" story, but this has more going for it than others.Elizabeth Moss is ever watchable, and ably assisted by a good core of support actors. She plays a lady who has escaped an abusive relationship only to find that she is being stalked by him, but nobody believes her as she claims he is invisible (so understanable!).The direction & pace is good, and the film leads more to being really a thriller than a horror movie. The Dark Universe collapsed with The Mummy reboot, but films like this one can keep those old stories going with updated revisions like this film. The ending was very good but you can kind of see it coming way ahead.I kind of liked it, but the problem is that it still ends up hitting a brick wall. It's all been done to death. It's still a good movie, but I can't see how it can be taken further. Sequels will be a waste of time.As a Saturday night film, it's worth a viewing."
743,It's a long domestic abuse film with some special effects.
744,Elisabeth Moss shines in a remake of a horror classic. The movie always has you leaning forward with anticipation. This movie never had a down moment and I could see myself watching it again and again.
745,"It's a good movie .
And a great performance for Elizabeth moss"
746,"There is no doubt that this is a great film, though I wouldn't say it's the most rewatchable film. I've watched it 3 times this year, the first was utterly phenomenal, the second was decent and whilst I enjoyed it a lot more the third time, it simply didn't pull me in as much as watching it the first time.I'd say it has the same effect The Dark Knight has were it's a masterpiece in the genre, but when you're sitting down wanting to watch something simpler to enjoy, this isn't exactly what you're going to go for.After watching all the other Universal Invisible Man movies, this is clearly the best if not second best to the original. They're very different movies so it's hard to compare, on the third watch I'd say I preferred the original more just because it was a bit more quirky.Elizabeth Moss provides a great performance in this, it's just not that interesting when rewatching it. I myself loving the bits where she had someone to bounce off of, even it it was the invisible man. I do love the fact the actor actually wore the green screen suit to do all of his bits, instead of just being the guy to show up in the beginning and the end as the character, he was the same all around and I really appreciate that.So yeah it's a great movie, just not something I would watch multiple times a year. I did notice a plot hole this time, when the sister comes in with the news that Adrian is dead it's a news website, how did that happen? Being that he faked his own death I get the brother bits where he saying he's dead and pretending he's in the urn but for it to be on a third party website came off as a bit weird. Being that at the end it shows that he was tied up under his house, if that was the case why where the police sent to search that area being that he was supposed to be dead. It just felt a little off, as I said the brother and the whole solicitor thing made sense, they could do that. But the media and the police, it just contradicts itself."
747,"It captivated me from the beginning and held my attention till the end. Very few movies have been able to do this. It's a proper thriller experience with horror aspects. Solid movies except for a few plot holes. Some things may seem illogical if you think about it. But if you just let the movie take you for a ride, it definitely will."
748,I am so confused. While I enjoyed it. Who killed everybody when she was on around watching everyone getting killed???
749,"The Invisible Man a film that takes on a story of Cecilia the protagonist who seems to be stalked by her husband 'Adrian' the antagonist. We see as she comes to live with her friend James and his daughters Cidney. The story develops into a psychological horror type story as people seem not to believe her attacks of an invisible man as it become visible to them. This film has many confusing storyline moments within it, especially the ending. This I admire as I enjoy endings where we as the audience have to depict what we think it is about. The themes that are also portrayed within this film aren't done the greatest. For example, the theme of horror is created in a way which a B-Grade horror uses score. The score used in drastic scenes of action seem way too dramatic. The suspense in this film is good though as it doesn't use score too much to support it but at times where it is, it's executed terribly and becomes too basic. One amazing thing this film provides is its beautiful and fantastic use of cinematography. The colour and lightning helps support this with the shots. There are some shots in this film which bring the atmosphere and emotion out very well and that definitely helped me enjoy the film to an extent. The use of animation within this film wasn't the best either. Once the invisibility suit was revealed, I felt as it was very boring and bland and the lead up to this reveal was too anticipated. The storyline is a very a good story. It is something very different and portrays a more psychological thriller to me with aspects of horror. An amazing thing they did well was take the comedy features out of ""horror"" & ""thriller"". This always ruins the mood for these types of films. I felt as Cecilia the character portrayed the best form of emotion & character development. We see as Adrian seems to distraught her mind psychologically and also other characters not understanding what she is experiencing. I felt all other characters in this film were very basic such as James, Emily, Adrian & Tom. None of these characters to me really brought any emotional response or showed any form of character development. Although this review seems quite harsh it's still an okay film. I would recommend to watch it if you really have nothing else to watch. Thank you"
750,"The title of my review says it all. It's not a bad movie, about 30 minutes too long. Good effects, ok story. All in all not a bad way to pass the time on a night with nothing to do."
751,"It was released in the calm before the storm, and for that reason, 'The Invisible Man' will be remembered as one of the last successful major pictures of the pre-pandemic period. But aside from that footnote, director Leigh Whannell's adaptation of an age-old tale stands on its own as a modern-day psychological thriller.Thanks in large part to the dramatic street cred that Elisabeth Moss has amassed over these past few years, 'Invisible' benefits from a built-in audience that follows her wherever she goes. It also helps that the plot is familiar enough, as H.G. Wells's classic tale has been revered for over a century. But the 21st century upgrade is done well, especially given the surveillance state that we appear to live in - where Big Brother is always watching. Moss is incredibly believable as the paranoid, difficult-to-trust, scorned woman, and her performance is perhaps one of the best she's ever delivered. The supporting cast does a very good job adding to the paranoia, particularly Aldis Hodge and Harriet Dyer, and the brief screen time from Oliver Jackson-Cohen is not wasted.But it's the cinematography that really delivers and makes 'Invisible' what it is. From the eerie camera pans to the ""cold open"" scene that sets us up for a chilling ride, the filming techniques play as important a part as the cast does. Sure, some of the events that unfold aren't all that surprising, but these ""twists"" are not overdone or insulting.Due to extenuating circumstances, 'The Invisible Man' will have the distinction of being one of the best films released in 2020. But even so, the film deserves credit for finding an audience during this difficult time."
752,"At least 30 minutes too long. They should have wrapped it up much sooner instead of dragging everything out. Every scene seemed to just go on forever. Also, I'm not a fan of movies about crying women and manipulative men."
753,"Tense, creepy movie. I thought it was quite good for a thriller, jump in your seat type of film. Cecilia is the girlfriend of some rich tech guy. She's tired of him being so controlling so she leaves him and hides out at a friend's house. Mean while, she learns her ex, Adrian, killed himself. So, she thinks she can go back to living a normal life, but she still has this creeped out feeling. She starts hearing noises, sees foot prints, Sydney gets slapped. She starts to believe Adrian is still around and some how used his tech knowledge to make himself invisible. Her sister receives an email from her computer in which it says hurtful things. Cecilia tries to convince her she didn't send it. She gets her sister to meet her at a restaurant, but before she can explain that Adrian may be alive, a knife cuts the sister's throat and people blame her. She knows Adrian followed her to the psych ward. She meets with Adrian's brother, Tom, and admits what she knows as true and wants her to agree to have a life with Adrian. Later in her room she stabs Adrian and escapes. He kills quite a few guards as his suit goes from being visible to not visible. Cecilia chases him and goes to her friend's house to protect Sydney. Sydney is already under attack, but from Tom, whom also has an invisible suit. She kills Tom and they find Adrian looked up in the basement of his house. She still believes it was Adrian whom killed her sister and was behind everything else. She goes to his house to have dinner and excuses herself after he wouldn't admit it. She puts on an invisible suit that she had found in his house earlier and makes it look like he committed suicide. And she gets her life back.Some of the plot holes: you have an invisible suit and all you do with it is stalk someone? Come on. After Adrian supposedly dies , his dog is still at the house? When Cecilia goes to the house via uber, how come Adiran doesn't see the SUV waiting in the driveway.FINAL VERDICT: Good for a thrill, just don't expect it to be completely logical. Worth a view."
754,"There is a war of wills at work in ""The Invisible Man"" with a man and wife attempting to outduel each other in a struggle to the death.Cecelia (Cee) has made a daring escape from a secure, bunker-like compound that is her home on Stinson Beach. She is running away from her control freak of a husband, Adrian Griffin, a genius in optics research.Once having fled the compound, Cee lives with the dear friends of her sister Emily, James and his daughter Sydney. But paranormal activities soon afflict the beleaguered Cee, wherein she believes that her husband is invisible and is tormenting her.After it is reported that Adrian has taken his life, Cee stands to inherit $5 million on the conditions that she does not commit criminal activity or display signs of mental illness. Adrian's brother Tom is the attorney settling the estate. Cee wants to give money to young Sydney so that she can attend fashion school. The only question is will Cee remain sane given the conditions of her invisible man?For the first half of the film, the pacing was sluggish, and the special effects of recreating the invisible man were not enough to sustain interest. The juicy action sequences finally kicked in during the final quarter of the film. There was an especially clever twist at the end during what can only be called The Last Supper.The strength of the film was in the sensitive performance of Elizabeth Moss as Cee. Miss Moss was in top form as she credibly reacted to the paranormal events of her spouse in his magical suit, appearing and disappearing in a heartbeat.One of the clues to understanding the true story of the mad scientist Adrian Griffin was the dog Zeus. There is a moment when Cee hails an Uber and travels from San Francisco across the Golden Gate Bridge to Stinson Beach along the coast. When she enters her former home, the dog Zeus is still in residence hail and hardy. There can be only one reason why Zeus is at the home: he is not the only occupant."
755,"As a fan of the Insidious franchise I was looking forward to this film due to writer/director Leigh Whannell.After watching the trailer it appeared to be a huge improvement on Tom Cruise's disastrous The Mummy and, in turn, the I'll fated Universal Dark Universe.No, I wasn't disappointed at all but wasn't really wowed so I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. A typical ""couple of beers and a big bag of crisps"" film.I fully expected more scares or ""jumps"" (although I'm not a huge fan a jumping out of my seat) although there are some eerie moments and some good effects, too.Without putting spoilers in, I did find the parts where it became more Sci-Fi in my opinion, to be the disappointing aspects.There are daft or silly elements in more than one scene (without using spoilers) when you think ""just check the CCTV"" which appears to be everywhere but doesn't appear to be monitored, used or checked at any point.Elisabeth Moss is great. Really good in her role and I'm pleased she was cast. A definite leading role in the film. Personally, I had many ""why won't anyone listen to her?!"" moments which shows how I identified with the character.On the whole I did enjoy it and if there are plans to produce more universal monsters films then this one has interested me in the franchise which, after Mr Cruise's escapades I felt was a lost cause."
756,"I love this movie entertaining, intense, smart, well-acted. Sadly though it misses its mark towards the end. It could've been more but instead chose to go the standard routine ending. Don't get me wrong I loved this movie but it's just shy of greatness."
757,Enjoyable enough. Bit silly in parts and perhaps the Griffin (the husband) could have played psychological games a bit more whilst invisible so Cecilia questioned her sanity and made the whole film a bit more tense. Not as awful as some reviews suggest though.
758,"I was looking forward to this movie, and it was good, however it was not as good as I had hoped for it to be. It was actually a pretty predictable movie. I would watch it again because as I said it was good. I just wish it had been a little more thought out."
759,"The movie was very well acted and directed. Just over 2 hours, but none of the time was boring. I found it refreshing that the movie doesn't spend to much time on the technology side of the invisible suit, it makes one invisible and thats all that matters. The little twists in final 30 minutes were also pretty good."
760,"Pros: The acting, the presence of music at only certain times, jumpscares xD.
Cons: Felt like movie was being dragged. Ending was meh."
761,"This movie wasn't great but it wasn't horrible either. It was certainly entertaining and Elizabeth Moss's acting wasn't pretty good for someone going crazy thinking an invisible person is attacking her. But I thought the movie just fell flat. I know it's a movie but too many little things didn't make sense. How did Adrian (who was following her everywhere) not know she had the other suit? And who was the random dude who drove her miles and miles to the house? Why did Adrian not kill the one police officer in the parking lot? Way too many things that happened in the movie made me just shrug my shoulders and go 'eh.' Again, it's entertaining if you want something to watch on a Friday night with friends but I would not watch this movie again if it was on TV."
762,"I watched the Invisible Man early June at Cineplex here in Pattaya, Thailand, as cinemas have re-opened, and I think the movie is quite alright. Surely, not an oscar contender (my opinion), but certainly entertaining and with a decent level of thrilling.Good acting performances by leading lady Elizabeth Moss and her supporting guy Aldis Hodge who kept the flick together with with talent. The other actors just got a passing D, nothing special about them.The plot is not bad, a psycho genius in optics makes a suit that turns him and his brother invisible, driving the woman he is obsessed with, Cecilia (Moss), crazy.How it all ends up, that is for you to find out.Yes, there are holes in the story. Some things do not click at all, just as the killing of Cecilia's sister at the restaurant, or the punching of the daughter of James (Hodge). Those scenes might automatically rise your eyebrow.However, all-in-all, the movie is quite decent, and some people give it a 7 star its also ok. I stay at 6. It is an acceptable film, worth of your time. Enjoy it."
763,"The horror genre has declined in a notorious way over the years, despite the fact that there are popular adaptations such as ""IT"" (2017), ""The Conjuring"" (2013), they are films that, being honest, are not at all the height of works such as ""Psycho"" (1960), ""The Exorcist"" (1973), ""The Omen"" (1976) or ""Alien"" (1979), these are films that are considered by many as masterpieces of horror cinema . Blumhouse Productions, is a film studio that is known for presenting curious ideas and taking risks for them, personally the only good films they have made would come from being ""Whiplash"" (2014) and ""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018), but then comes ""The Invisible Man "". In a few words The film is about how Cecilia ran away from her husband Adrian who was an abuser, after a time she finds out that he committed suicide, but she discovers that it is not so and that he is now invisible and is going to do the hell life. This begins with a scene in which Cecilia is escaping from her house, and this secuence seemed to me well accomplished because thanks to the details you understand what kind of man her husband was, so that he wants to flee from that life full of luxuries, You can understand why he is doing all that, then we are introduced to the people close to Cecilia who would be victims of Adrian's plan. Adrian or the Invisible Man could have me a well-written villain, I admire how the writers managed that the film did not need flashbacks for you to understand what kind of man he was. The way in which Cecilia is tormented despite the fact that at certain times it is more comical than terrifying, seems creative to me, the film makes, in certain scenes, feel the discomfort that the protagonist feels that she is being watched, harassed, what Which manages to generate tension, all this is reinforced with the convincing performance of Elisabeth Moss. Part of the bad of the film would be involved in act three, since it is the one that brings more conveniences, and things that are the opposite of real life (Apart from the action scenes, the special effects are somewhat bad ), for example those who have already seen it will know what I mean when I say that it is too much strength that they gave to the invisible man, nowhere in the film do they give you a sense that this trajectory gives superhuman strength, I know being invisible is a more difficult opponent to fight, but the way Cecilia's friend James defeats him is so unreal, the only thing you can say is ""So much muscle for nothing"", there are also the typical Cliches that the villain is going to kill someone important to the protagonist but due to his slowness salvation comes just in time, this can be applied in the scene where the invisible man is going to kill to kill Sidney the daughter of James, since although previously l or we saw mercilessly kill a group of guards at once, it does not do with Sidney and surprise comes salvation just in time. The end of this movie is interesting because of the way it is executed, but I find certain time contradictions in the way Cecilia kills Adri√°n, if it enters what they were trying to tell us, it is that Cecilia acts acting through the This rules because I knew you would never admit to being guilty, after all he's a manipulator, but how could he get to the trajectory and then shut it down so quickly? Maybe fans will start to come up with theories that someone else was actually wearing the suit, but I'm sorry I won't swallow it. Also, despite the fact that I said that the film manages to create tension at certain times, to be honest, it ended as fast as it could and never came back. ""The Invisible Man"" is not a smart movie with a complex plot, but it is a movie that manages to create tension at certain times and is perfect to see if what you are looking for is above average entertainment."
764,"I really wanted to love this movie. I like Elizabeth Moss as an actress, I like the idea this movie sets up: ""what if your psychotic ex became 'magically' invisible, and only you knew about it?"" Great premise; I haven't seen the original iteration so I don't know if a messed up relationship is part of its story, but I'm hooked so far... Then Cecilia turns into 'dumb horror chick' cliche for most of the movie and misses several opportunities to expose the antagonist (who has severely messed her life up without anyone being the wiser) by simply taking tooo long to move, or leaving clean evidence behind. I wanted to rip my hair out the whole way through.. But I had to finish it. The ending was satisfying enough, it just took frustratingly long to get to it. I'm giving it 6 stars because of the acting and effects. I like that the story is about a woman taking back her voice and freedom from an abusive partner but it could've definitely been condensed a bit (too many lingering still shots).Also c'mon... You had photos of you and your friend's daughter asleep that neither of you took, and you didn't immediately send them to your cop friend??? And how did no one hear the glitches and beeps coming from the suit the way she did?? He was in the room with other people at several points in the movie, where they're presumably moving around the space or it's quiet enough to hear him.. I'll entertain the idea though."
765,"First off, I am reviewing this movie on its own merit as I never saw the original and I am not really familiar with the character of The invisible Man. It did keep me entertained throughout, which is saying a lot for me. The first one third of the film I found gripping and suspenseful BUT THEN I found myself yelling ""she's so stupid"" at screen quite a bit for the remainder of the movie. I have a lot of questions! Who is the cop and his daughter that she goes to stay with and what is their relationship to her? When she finds all of the evidence in the attic why doesn't she try to take it with her or at least reference it when trying to convince everyone she's not crazy? why does she never use her own smartphone to collect pictures and evidence? She KNOWS Adrian is terrorizing her pretty early on in the film so why doesn't she hop to it a little bit quicker? Why doesn't she try harder to convince her sister that she did not actually send the email? How can pepper spray penetrate the seemingly impenetrable invisible Man costume? The friend / cop is horrible at his job! When returning home after our heroine is attacked, there is an obvious sign of a struggle! Why does this not alert him? Adrian is supposedly in the top of his field in optics, so why, at no point does anyone even bother to investigate our damsel's story. I have so many more questions! But I'm not going to ramble on. Just two more comments first, the movie should be titled ""The Invisible Man's Wife"" because we don't learn much of anything about the invisible Man and he's really only in the final scene of the entire movie. Second, the so-called twists are excruciatingly predictable."
766,"The movie starts out strong with a sense of mystery and an atmosphere of dread. The sound design is fantastic with large chunks of silence pierced by deafening sound. A sense of isolation is created pretty well in the early parts of the movie.When the movie needs to progress to the next act it fails. The supporting characters are fairly believable but the protagonist's behavior is at times baffling. It just doesn't feel convincing at all. The end of the movie doesn't feel right. There is no build up to this. It just happens. A longer runtime would have helped.The villain of the movie is invisible but also gains super strength which simply does not make sense. Seems like he could give Dwayne Johnson a run for his money. It also doesn't feel like the characters fighting the invisible man are doing their best to fight him which just makes the whole thing fall flat.Some of the things he gets up to as an invisible person are just not plausible. His reaction speed is godlike. This is most notable in the restaurant scene where I was thinking 'How the hell could he possibly have done that?'. Also seems the protagonist and antagonist are both well trained weapons experts which also makes no sense. These are the kinds of things that are normally setup in a film. If either character at minimum owned a gun it would have been believable. Instead they both steal guns and are pretty great at shooting.The explanation for the invisible man doesn't feel believable in the context of the movie. It's simply... 'he genius, he invisible'. To conclude it's hard to suspend disbelief with this movie. If a little more effort had been put in to setting up the events of the movie it could have been great."
767,"Look, I avoided this movie for a while because of how much The Handmaid's Tale was pi$$ing me off.. Something inside of me told me that this was going to be a ""message movie"".. (it was) and I wasn't down for that.
I finally put it on last night and while the beginning half was very ""pro-this and that"", the 'thrills' were great and I decided to go along with it, in fact, I kind of liked it so far. HOWEVER, that movie should've ended in the mental hospital, when they strapped her to the bed and injected her - Maybe when the doctor shut the door, the light should've flickered, or something, as some indication of is it? Was he?? Or even drag it to court where she has to try to prove her innocence.. I don't know, something better than what we got.
To me, trying to prove your innocence when all signs point to your guilt, is scary enough!
I think keeping it vague would've been A LOT better than the ""Offred-y"" ending we got, with Elizabeth Moss's extreme close up and all that 'messaging'.
I hate messaging in movies, it's just instant cringe for me, it ruins any story that is trying to be told.
In saying that... everything else was fine. (Not that kitchen fight, though.. yeesh.) I was seriously creeped out with wondering if she was insane or not."
768,"Some of the scenes could scare you, although expected but the scene control and the background music is good enough to stress the audiences.Plot holes as others discussed, yes what the hell is the dog sitting in the house when nobody is staying? It doesn't need food?As globally known optics scientist, his techs are just lying there?Scene with Adrian's brother is a bit of the twist but didn't carry much weight as the killing spree in the mental hospital is laughable. Even when the killer (assuming is the Brother) fled from the hospital and obviously passed through guards and metal detectors, the sensors didn't trace anything? There are more to explore in the raining environment.This is not a movie of dark ages but have we installed all cameras in the world on the suit until no one noticing abnormality especially in the restaurant?Lastly, not meant as plot holes compilation for this movie, so called heat sensors were a lost tech in this movie, not that I want to break the movie enjoyment but not practical. Suit seems to be programmable and easily suit any body type haha"
769,"There are a lot of fun points, say something I was impressed. For example, she was attacked at home by men, the results ran to the street immediately returned to the original villa, and very smooth guess the password. Found another stealth suit. That doesn't make sense.
There are also cloaking suits with cameras all over them, and trypophobia is very uncomfortable.
The end is also very ambiguous, in the end is the male master's brother is the real murderer, male master was mistakenly killed, everything is she imagined. Or male master is the real murderer, do not admit, she made a quick decision to kill.
In short, the experience is incoherent and the sense of fault is too strong. It's not a good substitute, but if it's just a horror movie, it's probably ok, for the atmosphere. Or commendable point. A lot of classic scary stuff and music. For example, invisible people throw coffee sand on the ground to make him visible. The noise in the attic. Medicine bottles pop up and so on."
770,"The plot of the novie is not backward or forward, but it is mixed, this what makes movie unpredictable. This movie has a huge potential but the writer i guess does not know it. Idk, it is just my personal opinion. There are some scene can be put together like how adrian abuse ces, or how much adrian is driven to get the baby. Overall, i enjoyed it, the missing plot did not important to understand the whole plot"
771,"#MovieReview #TheInvisibleMan #SpoilerFreeLeigh Whannel's retelling story that everyone knows captivates you from the word go and refuses to let go till the chilling climax. Elizabeth Moss turns in a riveting performance, aided by slick camera word and spine-tingling sound effects to give the viewer a terrifying viewing experience.Right from the opening sequence, the story moves forward at a breakneck pace with twists and turns at the most unexpected of occasions. What makes it stand out from all its predecessors is the awesome sound design that keeps you on the edge of your seat without any major visual imagery. It is in this aspect that the director has pulled off a true masterpiece in horror. Definitely worth a watch!"
772,"I liked most of the movie. A horror movie relying more on the atmosphere rather than jumpscares. Sometimes, it makes you believe that a jumpscare is coming and then doesn't. Then there's a twist: Adrian has a suit that makes him invisible. I didn't mind that twist. The movie still made sense and that was better than explaining everything with supernatural crap. The problema is... a second twist. Cecilia Kills the Invisible Man, takes off his mask and... it's Adrian's brother. That upset me a little. I would have given it a 7/10 if it was Adrian and then it ended."
773,"I quite enjoyed the first two thirds of the film, the suspense caused by being unable to see Adrian was really good. However, once you get the mental hospital, it got a bit daft. Why so many armed guards? What was the point of the rain? How did he get in and out of the rooms without someone noticing something? Did he stay in her locked room all night? How did he get there without a car? The suit was faulty, then not so faulty."
774,"Being a fan of the original Universal Movie Monsters i.e. Frankenstein, The Wolfman, The Mummy, etc. I was quite eager to watch The Invisible Man when it was first announced. To give a fair assessment, this movie is on the same level as the 2010 Wolfman remake. I am not sure why they needed to go with an R rating when clearly, it wasn't used to its full potential in both these films and especially in the Invisible Man.It would have been fair to have put The Invisible Man under the category of Sci-Fil/Action/Thriller rather than Horror. It has a decent start but like most other recent films, loses its plot after the halfway mark. Starting from the mental hospital sequence, there is little that makes sense and the plot becomes akin to a slice of Swiss cheese. The CGI is sub par.I give it a 6 because I would like Universal to not give up on it's quest to resurrect its monsters. I really wanted to see a great monster movie in the Invisible Man 2020 but sadly this wasn't the case."
775,Well. My intial thought was perfectly right. I assumed who was behind all this apparently my guess alwas accurate. It would have been better of the movie had an alternate endinf I suppose.
776,"Ok movie, that's it, just ok.
Absolutely nothing remarkable about it."
777,"Great idea: using the invisible man plot in service of a movie about stalking and the way especially women are haunted by abusive relationships. But the movie seems to have been made by people who have idea about police procedure, how science and invention works, estate law, general logic, storytelling, or film making.Elizabeth Moss is such a good actor, she almost makes it worthwhile, but the most fun was just spending the whole second half making fun of the dumb decisions."
778,"It's one of those thriller that starts off well and then gets progressively predictable. Also, the ratings and buzz had inflated its appeal. the opening is suspenseful and full of intrigue but mid way through the plot becomes a bit predictable and absurd. Elisabeth Moss is fantastic and does her best to save the film from falling into predictable and cheap horror tropes."
779,Wasn't bad. Good story line. Beginning was slow and slow through out. Had some good parts. Definitely seemed like a lower budget film.
780,"It was just okay for some Saturday night fun.
And that's all there is. I hope people hadn't paid money to see this in theatres cause it's not worth it. Zeus is adorable!"
781,"Somehow the story starts to lead you to what could be a good night thrill but soon you start to catch some little hole in the plot that you just consider close your eyes because, for a little while, you just don't imagine what will happen.Something strange right at the beginning. We're on a desert road in the middle of some pine forest, dark as coal so you need a lantern to see your way through. A car comes to pick you up, you're scared as hell and the driver is just like this was the most common thing to happen. Then comes the aggressor, breaks the car window and now your finally start the car and disappear in the night. Magically, a tiny vase of pills is instantly seen in the dark mist. Amazing.Then the perfect wave. A mail sent to her sister saying a lot of bad things but one thing you might think immediately is ""what about passwords"" Right after a scene where a James daughter gets hit by the Invisible man and she says it was Cee when she was a mile from her. So much love but no doubt it was her.Cee gets back to Adrian's home. All the passwords remain the same. Great. She discovers the suit or one of the suits, runs away, get on the uber, long lone distance ride to have dinner in a fancy restaurant with her sister. The invisible man is already there and takes out her sister life. Well, around here (Portugal), restaurants like that all have cameras. Not in there. Cee is arrest on a mental institute.
T
hen comes the rain scene. What the hell. So much suspense around the rain for nothing. At least when Cee begins her escape we discover that even hurt several times the suits must also give super strength to his owner as well as the suit mal function only seems to appear to Cee and right after we have a sweet Deja-vu Terminator scene as Cee tries to get out of the Mental Institute that has a bunch of highly harmed cops, badly trained and that appear by pairs.In the parking lot the not so invisible man, with the suit mal function gets seen by a cop. No bother. Never heard about it again. The invisible man starts running to James house to hurt his daughter. He got there and the suits is working just fine again. Although is a suit completely closed the spray does some effect. He got killed a minutes later. The suit was working fine and no one saw if it was the same guy with some pen holes.Right to the end. Another WTF moment. After some crying at the table moment Cee goes to the bathroom. Adrian is killed from behind while the bathroom was in front and some seconds after Cee appears running calling 911. You might think. There a third guy in there but no. It was her with a Suit perfectly her size and that she dressed up and undressed in just a few seconds. Wish she can be faster like this during the all movie."
782,"The plot could have come straight out of the early 90s with a particularly strong influence from Sleeping With the Enemy (1991). There's the same sort of controlling husband however in The Invisible Man he lacks any depth to his character, which can also be said about the rest of the characters. I feel they overdid it with the whole invisibility thing which was used as an excuse for weak plot, which overall was as shallow as a puddle."
783,"Ok, got that out of the way, and unlike other reviewers, I don't think the last third of the film is bad at all - what I did question were some very illogical decisions for such an optically inclined film - restaurants have cameras, hospitals have cameras, there were any number of times evidence could be produced to prove C's innocence, but those are minor annoyances in an overall entertaining popcorn movie. btw, the dog lives, quite well in fact."
784,"This movie is totally incredible but I just want to keep this review at a rather brisk pace, all I have to say is 3 words. Hospital, Kitchen and restaurant. I obviously can't explain why I'm saying those select words but once you have scene the movie you will understand why everyone is so blown away by this modern day classic horror film! P. S. Elizabeth Moss is absolutely outstanding."
785,"The Invisible Man is a seriously tone movie. With masterful camera work and an amazing acting by Elizabeth Moss. It's about an abusive boyfriend who terrorize his girlfriend and the people she loves. It is suspenseful, their is a slow burn to it, others may feel to be boring. The invisible man will bring out the scare. Their is one problem though, how does the suit develop its power source? Something to think about. If you have any theories."
786,"Elizabeth Mass acting talent is amazing, I basically went to watch her just be great. And she was but as a fan of her many of her emotions and acts were similar to hand Madea tale and the guy who plays the abusive boyfriend was great in hunting of hill house but maybe he is in the movie like 10 minutes and he could have been much better
There has been a lot of jump worthy moment but they show most of it in the trailers so I went there expecting more to this movie but I sortha saw everything in the trailer... And I blame marketing
In the end this movie was OK"
787,"Horror thriller based on the classic novel by H.G. Wells.The female protagonist is trapped in an abusive, controlling relationship, her boyfriend is a wealthy optical tech billionaire. She escapes his luxury home one night but later discovers that he's committed suicide and has left her $5 million. However, she suspects he's still alive but is now an invisible stalker. She's desperate to prove this.I really cannot understand the very good ratings, to be fair I had high expectations for this movie, but it was not much more than a made for T.V. movie. I was bored soon after the protagonist escapes. There were too many obvious plot holes. You'll realise at the end that the sequel (you can bet on that) will be The Invisible Woman."
788,"I thought this movie was going to tank or not make any sense, but I was wrong. Way wrong. This movie kept me focused throughout the film. Yes, I did jumped a few times. Especially towards the end of the film a unexpected twist. Possibly opening up a sequel."
789,"This movie can be easily summed up. All the white men are evil, dumb or useless. The white sister is a cold and stupid moron. The black family are happy and good and the black man is strong, good natured police officer. The protagonist is an abused woman who breaks free of the evil white husband and manages to kill both him and his weak and equally evil white younger brother. Why I rented this I have no idea? Don't waste your time or your money, you'll only create more demand for this woke propaganda."
790,I'm sorry but I don't buy that any of these people would have done the things they did. Cecilia wouldn't have gotten trapped in that relationship. The brother wouldn't have aid and abetted murder...to watch no one believe Cecilia and her life just spiral downward is just frustrating to watch and the dialogue is clunky. (Who leaves a pan of bacon and eggs on the stove and walks away not thinking that it would catch on fire? Hmm? )
791,"You knew this movie would be horrible as soon as you see the opening credits CGI-ed into the water... HORRIBLE. CinemaSins is going to destroy this thing.Invisible plot holes. Invisible acting skills. Invisible suspense... invisible bank account after everything is done.The main actress (Elisabeth Moss) is seriously a horrible actress. Horrible. And she distracts you from being able to focus on the movie. She overacts every single thing. If she jumps from a sound she exaggerates it by 10x. If she looks over her shoulder to see if someone is following her she exaggerates it by 10x. I honestly am having a hard time even watching her face because it is so ugh.From the first scene the exposition is that of a first-year film student. How do you know she drugged him? She picks up the bottle of pills and shows it to you. But that isn't enough... no no, she also needs to pick up the glass of water and swirl it so you know it is in the bottle. Then she needs to say his name out loud so that he doesn't move. Then she needs to read the bottle again. Over and over.Why is this dude's research lab connected to the garage? Because the movie needs it to be. How did the dog get into the garage? Because the movie needs him there. Why in God's name did the sister stop the car to pick up the main character and then just sit there and not move?? She saw the man running towards the window and just sat there. You know she already knew that her sister was being abused, but she acted like she did not understand why she was picking up her sister in the woods in the middle of the night. Then she continued to sit there while the guy busted out the window like Superman.Am I spoiling the movie? NOPE. Why? Because all of this is in the trailer. Watch the trailer and you will know how horrible this movie is, because the trailer shows every single thing that happens in a linear fashion.Who greenlit this crap???? This movie is the reason why you do not let the director of Insidious 3 write a screenplay for a 100 year old franchise and then direct it, like he has free reign to do whatever tf he wants. I'm sorry, but they need to bring Harvey Weinstein back to Hollywood because the crap that is being churned out is WACK."
792,One of the worst movie I ever sow. Terrible. Lost time watching this movie.
793,"Don't waste your money, story totally sucked ... hate when these millennials destroy a classic"
794,"Loved this movie, really terrified me but also has a great story and the acting is fantastic from moss"
795,"Already the trailer was a bit of a downer for me. It gave away almost the whole story which I think potentially kills a movie. So please don't watch the trailer.
Its rather difficult to keep such a story interesting and scary. I mean think about it, how do you make a movie where the audience needs to be frigthend by something that isn't there. That get's boring really fast. This film kinda nailed that. Even tho it was a bit slow at times it never got really boring. The actors did a great job. And I didn't have an issue with cheap jumpscares. My only problem was that it wasn't difficult at all to know what happens next. Very predictable. I wouldn't recommend to watch it at the movies."
796,"The casting of the lead as a femme fatele is absurd. She is bizarre and unattractive. She looks like a bag lady. There are endless possibilities for the invisible man story, but this writer and this director show no creativity. It's a bore and a waste of time, my time. Miss it if you can."
797,"Im a huge fan of Elisabeth Moss, as far as Im concerned because of The Handmaids Tale she can do no wrong! And its absolutely not her fault that this film feels like a flop but I must admit Im at a loss as to why on earth she has chosen to do this project.
There is too much in the 'invisible' story that feels technically banale and underwhelming.
Scenes that would have been so much more thrilling by staying subtle goes full gore. And there is a tendancy to overact in some parts of the film. Also I lost belief in miss Moss's character when at the end her untill then grounded and 'innocent' character suddenly becomes an unsophisticated murderess herself, poor script. Shame!"
798,"This is so well done and with real life terror, not supernatural horror. The movie is stalking, abuse, control, and gaslighting that happens in the real world which makes it absolutely terrorizing. Very well done."
799,"This movie took forever to develop it's characters, specifically Elisabeth Moss as Cecilia Kass. While I believe Ms. Moss gave the role her best, she was hobbled by inadequate scene changes and poor dialog, leaving the audience praying for the ending. I think the story had great potential but the editing and direction failed to create the suspense it deserves. Rated this a 2."
800,"This is f'd up. Already saying that. But the leading lady isn't a woman to go crazy over in my opinion. Some billionaire genius picked some random chick at the mall or something? It's not like they cast Jessica Alba or anything. She's mopey. She's frumpy. She's stupid enough to leave a pan on the stove and leave the room.
Like others have mentioned, too many people making too stupid of decisions."
801,"""The Invisible Man"" is about how a genius Optics Engineer (33 yr old Oliver Jackson Cohen), obsessed with his wife (38 yr old Elisabeth Moss), invents a suit that makes him invisible, solely for the purpose of tormenting her. Only God knows what he wants from her.Apart from the storyline, the biggest disappointment in the film is the casting of Elsiabeth Moss as the leading lady.Not all scripts, necessarily, demand an attractive leading lady but this film does. Coz, The entire film revolves around her husband's obsessed of her. Unless people find her incredibly attractive, the reason behind her husband's obsession can't be convincing enough to root for her character. Elisabeth Moss is neither attractive nor delivered an effective performance.Apart from that, the film is filled with other plot holes and irrational character behaviours like below:1. Throughout the film, The leading lady laments that her husband controlled & abused her. So, why can't she file a case against him? Why should she run and hide? Why can't she use media to expose him?2. How could Cecilia's sister believe that her sister sent a hate mail despite she denying any knowledge of Such mail? Wouldn't she get suspicious? Or is she not her real sister?2. When Sydney is attacked by Tom (Invisible Man), why would she blame Cecilia for that? Even a kindergarten kid would scream that a Ghost attacked him.3. How can the invisible man get rid of the paint?4. Why police didn't bother to investigate the murder of Cecilia? Why didn't they check CCTV footage?5. How could the invisible man reach his house from Cecilia's friends place? Did he use a private jet with Invisible suit? Or did he use a car? Or is it Tom's brother in the suit? In either case, how come Cecilia never noticed a vehicle outside the house When she comes out?6. Now, the most annoying part. The hospital action sequence. Cecilia stabs Tom with a pen making him partly visible. He murders the first police which is reasonable coz he saw him. But, if Tom's motivation is to Pin Cecilia for her sister's murder, why the hell should he go on a killing spree? What's the motive behind it? Does he now want to become like Thanos, all of a sudden? It was really annoying to see Tom killing each and every police officer that comes despite they not noticing him. He could have simply escaped pinning the police's murder on his wife as well.7. When Tom is about to kill police officers, why didn't Cecilia try to shoot him from back? Never mind. Now, when Tom escapes from hospital, why didn't she try to convince police of existence of invisible man, through CCTV footage? She could very well seek their protection. Nope. She also escapes, steals a vehicle and chases her husband, because she's a strong woman who can fight injustice.6. When Invisible Man attacks Sydney at the end, how could he quickly move from bedroom and attack her from front, despite the space being so narrow? Can he pass through people?7. If Tom's brother is in the game, what's his motivation?8. At the end, when Tom says that his brother controlled him, what does he mean? We don't get to know his version, because Cecilia murders him by using the suit that she stole. She also gets away from that murder, thanks to her cop friend.9. Why didn't Tom use all his strength to protect himself from Cecilia cutting his throat? Is he that weak?Could Tom be completely unaware of any such suit? Maybe yes, cause he might have been controlled by his brother throughout. Maybe he didn't fake his death. But his brother made all that, when Tom's unconscious. It could be true that he was held captive in his own basement. Anything is possible in a Leigh Whannell film.Considering the history of Mr. Whannell's writings, he might have very well written a similar plot twist .However, due to ongoing #MeToo movement (as stated by previous reviewers) he might have been forced to change the script.Anyway, as this is a standalone film, the ending makes this film a major disappointment as I'm not at all concerned about the female lead.PS: Wouldn't have expected much from any unknown filmmaker.
But, as it's a Leigh Whannell film, I was waiting for the usual mind blowing plot twist at the end, which to my surprise, is............................................. that there isn't any."
802,"Hated it, to say the least. A complete waste of $13. Good luck to whoever watches it next. It was the most boring, awful, ungodly film I have ever seen in my whole life. And I have seen a lot of films. So. But I mean that's just my opinion."
803,"This spooky murder-mystery barely held my attention because it is so dragged-out. The many scenes where Elizabeth Moss feels she's being stalked by a ghost, and later, invisible man, are at least twice and long as they should be.Her perpetual look of despair and anxiety is almost as monotonous as Joaquin Phoenix's Batman Joker character depiction in the 2019 film.By far the biggest flaw in the film is getting the audience to hate the bad guy, Moss' boyfriend, actor Oliver Jackson-Cohen. She describes him as really evil, but we never see his character in action until the final minutes of the film! So, his character development is pretty anemic.This film has a few parallels to the 1991 film Sleeping With the Enemy. A women is trapped in a abusive relationship in a luxury oceanside home with a despicable mate. A death is faked and the woman goes into hiding and is stalked by her former partner.But in the 1991 film we see so much brutality we are primed to want the male abuser dead, dead, dead! In the Invisible Man all when have is a long-winded narrative from Moss about what a creep the guy is. And, as any marriage counselor says, there are two sides to every story.Also implausible is the boyfriend's huge basement workshop that is full of as much techno-gear as Iron Man's lab. This never got Moss' curiosity until after he *disappears?* She must have at least been curious how he made big-bucks.The invisibility suit is cool and somewhat based on current technology experiments, and so, is plausible. But I wish that was true for the rest of the film."
804,"The script seems to had been written by a 12 years old kid, totally implausible, delirious and extremely dumb.
I consider this movie to be an insult to the viewer money and time, is like they laugh to the consumer face by deceiving and making it look like a decent film for the first half and then throwing total nonsense expecting the viewer to be the ultimate gullible simpleton.
The score makes me wonder how lost the world is, anybody with a higher than two digits iq would never give this more than a 4.In resume, do not waste your life and do something better anything would be better than sit through this joke."
805,How the hell did this movie make so much money. It was like watching a bad session of improv
806,I think that it's one of the best horror movies i have seen! I definitely recommend it!!
807,"Let me see if I have this right.. a woman escapes from an abusive boyfriend, hides out for 2 weeks literally terrified he might find her, gets pissed when her sister comes to the house she's hiding at for fear her ex might have followed her (who, btw, just shows up to inform her that the ex is dead according to one obscure post on the internet), only to immediately go to see said ex's brother for an inheritance she was getting according to a letter she found in the mailbox at the house NO ONE was suppose to know she was at, address in HER NAME and she didn't fine THAT suspicious??? So women are terrified for their lives up until MONEY is involved... hahahahaha.. whatever..."
808,"I don't write reviews often. This is an unpaid review. I watch movies on a daily basis. So does my wife who is a brutal critic of films. We BOTH loved this film immensely. It's smart, subtle and packs a walloping punch when you get to the 3rd act. The setting and atmosphere holds you and then chokes you. When you thought you've seen everything when it comes to thrillers, you'll realize you were wrong. Do yourself a favor. Watch it."
809,"Excellent movie. Totally unexpected. I love how our viewer emotions transition from not knowing if she is paranoid to learning that there is something in the room. I love how she transitions from being a scared, abused and insecure woman to a kick ass heroin in a very real way. The psychology is perfect, if you ever met an abused woman or a narcissist abuser you would know that is exactly right. A story that needs to be told. My only complaint is that the Invisible Man used to be a hero to me in the old series... LOL not the bad guy... I wonder if the sequel will be a redeemer!"
810,"Lmao all these Negative reviews take everything for granted. It's a fictional movie so obviously it's going to have fictional elements to it. If you love thrillers that keep you at the edge of your seat like Saw, this is one to watch. A note: I fell asleep through parasite so I'm not sure how that movie gets more praise than any other great movies made."
811,"This reimagination of the 1933 classic horror ""The Invisible Man"" has shown to be a good representation of abusive relationships. It has excellent cinematography, acting and very good surprise moments. It deserves a more welcoming reception on this site and more than just a 7.3 grade."
812,Wastage of time. Nothing compared to the original invisible Man movie
813,"I would recommend 'The Invisible Man' as a fun watch if you like light thrillers and the occasional jump-scare or surprise. Unfortunately some of those surprises are already in the trailer, which brings me to the next point- there is nothing really new in the movie itself. Ignoring some of the plot holes, the story is reasonable and so is the acting but nothing ground-breaking.
Some of the actions taken by many of the characters is questionable at best. Some examples: the sister is in low-enforcement but in several scenes acts like a teenager, the husband supposed to be a genius but then makes some really bad decisions etc etc. This is mainly the reason I give this movie a 6 vs a 7 but if you can ignore this and have a pop-corn box handy you should be able to enjoy the movie. A word of warning- there is no nudity or sex in the movie but there are some bloody scenes from time to time. Not for kids.
Exact score: 63 / 100"
814,"I'm not sure what I imagined this film would be about but it wasn't what I saw.The plot was good, I like the story but there was some continuity errors and logic errors. The man has 2 suits... Doesn't realise one of them is missing??The woman cuts her wrist but doesn't leave blood trails when dragged on the floor or even bleed out....I like the idea of the invisible Man and I liked the story.. just could have been better"
815,"Much of the film did capture the sense of a real or imagined invisible presence, The Invisible Man, if you will. They did a good job at portraying that essence. However, as the film progressed, it became more about one woman's liberation, almost emancipation, from a marital, spousal abuse situation, and less about The Invisible Man. In fact, that just became a plot device in the end, which, IMO, really killed the whole premise of the film. Which, not entirely surprising when you consider the type casting of one actress, Elisabeth Moss. Sad, because it really could have been ""just"" about The Invisible Man, and that whole thing, but that was muted behind what it morphed into. I even got the sense that a hallway tussle with almost an entire a police unit was pretty much an Invisible Man apologetic of sorts, but it does not make up for the confusion in the messaging, even to the point of trying to play off this man in the very end as being somehow ""reclusive"", i.e. ""invisible""."
816,"But just another whiny female playing the domestic violence card instead of focusing on a great movie that should of been something outstanding. And Elizabeth Moss, just a poor actor and ugly actress who just irritates in every scene"
817,"Waste of my time. This film is so bad, and
The ending is a bit poor."
818,My biggest problems with movies these days is that the trailers seem to give away the biggest plot points. And this movie is no different revealing the entirety of the movie from start to finish in 2 minutes. After watching the movie the trailer just reinforced what i already thought. Tired of seeing my entire movie experience in a trailer. That being said some bits where interesting but the whole movie experience was already spoiled having seen the trailer.
819,"In short : I love everything about this movie, the acting, the cinematography, the twist and turns, how the entire movie builds up, how it made me sit on the edge of my seat wishing I had a pillow to hide behind at times, captures you from the very first second until the very end.... I repeat, I LOVE THIS MOVIE - Go watch it, watch it now."
820,"So I went to see this in the cinema based on the general review and out of curiosity. All in all, a waste if my time. Poor plot and story, slow pace that at some point you surely get bored. I only recommend it if you have nothing better instead."
821,"Could they have shown less in the trailer? Yes. Could they have named it something different? Yes. But did it surpass my expectations? Certainly. I went in with the mindset that I would be disappointed, but I was pleasantly surprised. There's something about horror movies that have a sense of realism that really gets me going. Now does this invisible suit seem unrealistic? Maybe, but the point is I felt like it could really happen, and that to me is what makes a really good horror movie. I cannot stand when modern day horror movies focus too much on special effects and worthless jump scares, there is certainly something to be said about the quality use of open space in this movie. Definitely worth the money to go see it."
822,"No spoilers here:
-
I just watched it 2 hours ago in the cinema. One of the best horror movies I have ever watched no cap. This will definitely win multiple awards no doubt there, a must watch - and another great piece of cinematographical art.To the people saying: ""This movie isn't it!"" It most truly IS if you actually have an understanding in story-telling and in the art of creating something beautiful like a film. In the filmography of horrorfilms specifically, I have never ever seen such a great mix of performance, MUSIC (phenomenal), storytelling, directing, Cinematography and dedication ETC for creation of a horrorfilm as this one.This film has NOIR and it includes a little bit of Art-house in it as well, along with a lot of other things of course.Here we don't talk opinions, we talk facts and these things YOU as a normal viewer don't understand is EXACTLY what the Academy Awards specifically values and looks at...Moral of the story, this film is by fact greatness."
823,"An all too predictable script leads to the titular character hanging around being a minor annoyance for a few days before making an abrupt left turn into Michael Meyers territory. In fact, it's clear the director studied John Carpenter for some of the shots used in this film, but where they worked in Halloween, they fall short here because the character is invisible.
Elisabeth Moss turns in a bland performance full of baffling decisions, which is partly the fault of poor scripting. Aldis Hodge, however, brings some real talent to the movie, making his scenes something to look forward to. All in all, if you have time to go see this movie, pick up a puzzle instead."
824,"I don't know what to say about this movie... people are raving about it, and it's Apparently #1 right now at the box office, but it seemed to me that there wasn't enough Kevin Bacon in this film.Seriously though...this movie is neither as good, nor as bad as the reviews are indicating.It's somewhat entertaining if you can suspend disbelief and just go with it, but it does have some serious flaws.I'd say go see it, but don't complain about wasting your time and money when it kinda sucks.I haven't seen Hollow Man in 19-20 years, and I remember very little about it, but I guarantee that it is superior in every way to this film."
825,Starts off quite good however fails in final 45 minutes.
826,"I can't understand why this boring and badly made film has received such a high score. The story took ages to start into what is actually meant to be about and gave you no insight into the main characters actual controlling abuse she was meant to have received from her husband, you just have to take her word for it. It rolled along with completely unbelievable police actions for example what police agency would use a friend of an accused murderer to investigate and interview the murderer who was a friend staying at his house. These inaccuracy happened many times. When she is locked up in mental hospital and the Invisible man is discovered by security they run into scenes with totally timed accuracy that looks so false but i don't want to get into how bad the Invisible fight scenes looked .I'm pretty sure if an Invisible man was discovered in the way he was then there would be hard covering that up and unimaginable amount of government agencies would be swarming all over the place and anybody with any connection to it. The film just goes on and on in a stupid and ridiculous manner with so much unrealistic behaviour and action by people in jobs that would never act like this and the twist which I will not revile comes in at about 10 minutes to go which adds nothing to the film and looks like the writer or director thought ""I'll just tack that on to add a twist"" .He should have added the twist with more time left .The ending well I will leave that up to you but when you see it do you think The police would act in this way? I liked this Directors film Upgrade but he has failed badly here in my opinion an absolutely terrible film that made me almost walk out the cinema and only stayed because I thought this has got to pick up and be better somehow."
827,"Great movie, acting was great, great story and execution, direction"
828,"My son hauled me out reluctantly to watch this movie.
As a woman in her 60s with much experience of life/ relationships and what can turn into a nightmare - l applaud everyone in the making of this film.
What a social commentary on domestic violence.
Many parts l hid behind my hand over my eyes!
I just couldn't bear to watch.
I worked in a safe refuge for women and their children.
This film delivers a palpable sense of looking behind you.
This film delivers the terror of being stalked by an ex partner.
This film delivers authentic reality of what it is like to be hunted by an ex partner/ husband.
Great connection with my adult son on drive home about care of women/ manipulative behaviour, domestic violence.
We talked about personal and cases of domestic violence in our country and world wide.
Safe houses are vital for women."
829,"Greetings again from the darkness. I got hooked on ""Monster"" movies as a kid, and even all these years later, I still get a kick out of them. Of course, with today's special effects, the look of these films is much different than in the early days. The big challenge for the genre now isn't how to frighten us or create an awe-inspiring effect, but rather can it capture the charm and appeal of those ground-breaking B-movies? Universal Studio's Dark Universe got off to a less-than-stellar start with Tom Cruise's 2017 THE MUMMY. Now, after re-grouping, the fabled Monster studio re-boots THE INVISIBLE MAN ... with roots in H.G. Well's 1897 sci-fi novel and the Claude Rains - James Whale film from 1933.Perhaps their best decision was choosing Leigh Whannell to write and direct. I'm hesitant to mention that Mr. Whannell was a creative writing force behind both the SAW and INSIDIOUS franchises, as some may jump to conclusions on what to expect with this latest. All I can say is that you'd be incorrect to assume THE INVISIBLE MAN falls in line with those previous films. Instead, this film is a psychological thriller in the form of #MeToo vengeance. Whereas the 1933 film featured a brilliant scientist whose invention turned him sour, this contemporary version is told from the viewpoint of a woman who has been abused and controlled by her boyfriend.When we first see Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss), she is sneaking out of her stunning cliffside home while her boyfriend Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) sleeps. Within just a few minutes, Ceclia's escape has taken us on a tour of the home (including a high-tech laboratory), disclosed that she has drugged Adrian, introduced us to her sister Alice (Harriet Dyer), and above all, given us a glimpse at just how terrorized Cecilia feels. The sequence is complemented by a nerve-jarring score from composer Benjamin Wallfisch (BLADE RUNNER 2049).We flash forward two weeks and find Cecilia taking refuge at a friend's home, and she remains so paranoid, she is barely able to step outside. As the old saying goes, 'is it paranoia if they are really after you?' Her friend is James (Aldis Hodge, CLEMENCY), a stout no-nonsense cop and single dad raising teenage daughter Sydney (Storm Reid, A WRINKLE IN TIME). When it's discovered that Adrian has committed suicide and, according to Adrian's creepy attorney brother Tom (Michael Dorman), left millions to Cecilia, she allows herself to celebrate the moment. However, what fun would it be watching her spend and give away money? Instead, the tone shifts and Cecilia's life becomes unbearable as she is convinced dead/invisible Adrian is torturing her. As you can imagine, this leads to questions about Cecilia's mental stability, which then leads to more misery and tragedy.Director Whannell's brilliant approach and Ms. Moss' superb performance combine to make this a thrill ride worth taking ... it's the kind where some folks in the audience shout warnings to the characters on screen! It's difficult to tell which is more frightening, having everyone you know think you have lost your mind, or actually being stalked by an invisible, presumed-dead former abuser who wants you to suffer. Floating knives and physical fights are unsettling, but can't compare to the tension created by cinematographer Stefan Duscio turning his camera to a blank wall or empty space. Our mind (and Ms. Moss's face) fill in the gaps with Adrian's evil presence. This is not a scientist-gone-bad, but rather a madman utilizing his most powerful tool. Having Adrian be an Optics innovator was a contemporary twist that takes us from the science fiction of the 1930's to the technological world of modern day.The film was originally going to star Johnny Depp, but it works so much better, and is so much more terrifying, having it told through the eyes of Ms. Moss' Cecilia. Strangely enough, the movie I kept flashing back to was not the 1933 Claude Rains and Gloria Stuart (64 years later, she played reminiscing Rose in TITANIC) movie directed by the great James Whale, but rather the schlocky 1991 Julia Roberts film SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. This is the most fun kind of movie suspense, and what's scarier than the things we can't see? It's nice to have Universal Studios' monsters back on track, and we have talented filmmaker Leigh Whannell to thank for this ""Surprise!"""
830,"Disappointing, predictable, an hymn to conjugal violence. Wondering how I would feel if I were sitting in the cinema with a violent partner, scared to death? Forced to watch and afraid to leave so I don't get beaten when getting back home.
A 10 year old would understand the whole plot in the first 10 minutes if they were allowed in the cinema."
831,Elizabeth is the queen of the quality horror films. All the scenes are well designed. Very entertaining thriller. I loved it.
832,The moron who said it had plot holes doesn't get it's a thriller not an oscar contender!! Moss was amazing!! Phenomenal directing will buy this in 4k ultra!! Cant wait to c it again!!
833,This is a well-made movie with great acting. It is an edge of your seat thriller in the vein of the old Alford Hitchcock movies. Loved it!
834,"This film had me questioning whether or not the director and his jolly cohort of sidekicks,had any idea what genre of film they were aiming for!I thought the film was well made..though,that was about all there was for me.
I found the acting to be very boring and without substance,the pacing of the movie lacked in many parts,it was very lack lustre,there wasn't enough solid scary frightening scenes,the film seemed to me as a cross between the Lawn mower man,and Spawn or something."
835,"It starts off fine and builds up nicely. I like the fact the main actress isn't a typical cute looking sweetie but a strong woman who fights with her evident and logical phsychological issues. It paces slowly and offers real suspense, step by step, and has potential for a really decent horror thriller. However, when things finally become visual, it turns into a C level action thriller where cops die from a punch in the face or from being pushed into the wall. The film tries to be in year 2030 at some times, but has poor script flops like its from 1990s at the same time."
836,"Camerawork was brilliant, Directed beautifully and the story was intriguing, Loved it!"
837,The twists and turns of this movie are awesome. Elizabeth Moss does an amazing job. Definitely one of the best thrillers of recent years. One to enjoy.
838,"I tried to watch this film, but the lead actress is so unbearably unattractive that I just couldn't get into it. The storyline seems to be a do-over of the Invisible Man tale, tailored to LMN, the purveyor of the ""lone woman in terrible danger"" movie franchise.Who decided that this untalented, homely woman should be in films, anyway?"
839,Save yourself ALOT of time and AGONY by skipping this movie. I got all the way up to the half way point when I finally said this has to be the worst written pile of trash this year. The acting is horrible. The writting is in itself the greatest horror in the movie. Who on earth gave this a high rating for it to have 7.7? Save your time and money. Rent/watch something else. Anything else. Complete waste.
840,"How does this movie have an overall rating above 2.0 out of 10? This was absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. Didn't finish it, and didn't care to. The acting was horrible, the editing was bad, and the overall feel of the movie was very awkward. Feels like a movie made by a student that ended up getting them kicked out of film school. And I usually like bad movies that critics slam."
841,This movie is nearly unwatchable from top to bottom. What a joke that anyone likes this film much less gives it a high rating. Educate yourselves people. Watch better films. This is a failed project. Truly a lemon. Congrats!
842,Great film with some excellent twists & turns. Keeps you guessing & on edge of seat.
843,"I just can't watch anything Moss is in. Each year of school and most years of your life you meet a person who you felt sorry for, but just didn't want to be around and it made you fell bad about yourself for feeling that way. Elizabeth Moss reminds me of all of them.Got thru a year of Handmaid's Tail ... started the 2nd and just wanted to leave the room when she came on screen.... sighed when she came on screen in Spencer Confidential ... broke a promise to my wife when I said Id watch Emma with her but backed out when I saw her on screen.I stayed thru this movie cause I wanted to see how they did the tech. Without Moss, Id give it a 6 ... with Moss a 2.5"
844,I can recommend you to watch this. A well-made movie that has a good story. Incredibly exciting movie that does not resemble all the others.
845,A good thriller movie with a good plot. Actors where great.
846,Waste of time. So many plot holes and implausible scenarios. I dont understand how this got a rating of > 7. Shouldve watched the witch instead.
847,I dont wanna say she's ''ugly'' or ''out of shape'' but for a woman that's stalked and obsessed over by some ''rich evil genius playboy that can have any woman'' shes a bit overrated ....and i also dont wanna say shes a ''hunchback caveman '' because shes not.
848,"Every time Cecilia turns around, she's terrorized. Every time she tries to dig herself out of a hole, her enemy's a step ahead. Maybe because the premise is simple, it doesn't work for some people. But this is what makes the story work (and what made the movie a hit, I'm sure).People screamed in the theater at a few of the genuinely shocking moments."
849,"From the offset this movie reeked of Saturday afternoon low budget drama. The sound, the darkness and the lack of anything happening. Suspense is created with good writing, when that fails, show shots of nothing, followed by actors on the go slow?Then there's the ridiculous. Ridiculous things actors say or do that seem completely unnatural because the writers don't know how else to tell the story.The breakfast scene was painful. The food catching alight in a matter of seconds... I ALWAYS fry on high heat and that's never happened to me. Considering everything else is happening in slow-mo why speed this up? Why put out the fire but not turn off the gas? How did that kitchen have no damage?The movement of the invisible man. Completely impossible. All angles are covered yet he manages to evade three people in a room and still make no noise at all? The one puff of air outside, how could he possibly be next to her all that time and not breathe or shiver like she was?Her sisters reaction to the email. Of course she would be mad, but when she's knocking on the door claiming to have no knowledge and then saying with shock that she didn't write it... why does the sister not even for a second believe that someone else could have written it? Wouldn't she have found it out of character? Wouldn't she have called her as soon as she read it to ask what the hell? Wouldn't she have found it all a bit odd and wanted an explanation?By this point I was done. I couldn't sit through any more. a quick flick through to find the lame twist, which was already obvious, and to find out that the invisibility was down to a suit... an impossibly quiet suit...The Invisible Man deserves a decent movie in the current world of amazing CGI and countless great directors. Sadly, this isn't it."
850,"This wasn't a dreadful movie bc there are certainly worse out here. But some areas make you say come on.....from her watching him kill so many officers before doing anything to the young girl just sitting there screaming watching her father get attacked. I can't imagine someone just watching their family member about to die and all they can do is scream....Then for her to take so long to shot at him was crazy because she's supposed to be trying to get away not watching him kill everyone. It started off super slow which almost made me turn it off. However, the overall plot of the movie was good. Some fine tweaks would have made it amazing."
851,"This movie did not show any elements of horror. On top that there a lot of plot holes that were not covered. The timing of scenes did not add up, such as when she threw paint on him and the paint dried up in less then 5 seconds and when Adrian got stabbed the holes were no where to be seen in the next scene. We also never got the explanation on who the invisible man really was. Did Tom take a hit for his brother or was it Tom the whole time. Over all this movie was not horror there was not even a cheesy jump scare."
852,"If the Invisible Man struck you as another cheap horror movie and you decided not to see it, I promise you will not regret watching it. As someone who usually doesn't like horrors, I found this film to be truly fantastic. First and foremost is Elizebeth Moss' unbelievably good performance that is both tragically depressing and haunting. She brings so much depth and emotion to the character, and definitely deserves at least a nomination at the next academy awards. In addition is some of the best cinematography in a horror film and a brilliantly written script. The Invisible Man will go down as one of the best modern horrors."
853,"A promising start, and well acted by the lead throughout, but the plot is so thin and full of holes.
As it's supposed to be a thriller, rather than a fantasy, any attempt to build suspense is let down by the sheer absurdity.
I found it tedious, and could happily have stopped watching well before the end.
I would prefer to paint the fence and watch it dry than watch this again."
854,"Sorry for myself but the most boring plot ever.
No plot holes like the others seems to tell but a miserable story of an abusive genius who had nothing better to do when he mastered the invisibility than harassing a woman. Really???"
855,"Every good review on this movie simply says: exciting and simple movie with nice effects, worth a watch! The momentary score of 7.1 is adequate.Every bad review is like: "" i liked the first 2/3 of the movie because it handled the topic of domestic violence and it's impact on today's society so well, but then it simply lost it's spirit and had nothing interesting to say anymore...."" ..........It's a horror / thriller movie, if you have watched the trailer or have read the title, it should become obvious, that this movie is not meant to have any meaningful philosophical message, it's main purpose is to entertain."
856,This was 1 of the worst movies I have ever seen and believe me I have seen a bunch. It was so slow and just when you thought it might pick up it didn't. Total trash. The original with Claude Rains can't be beat so I don't know why Hollywood keeps trying. Not worth your time!
857,"Well-made, well-directed, well-acted. suspenseful and psychologically creepy. great musical score. the only thing that disappointed me was that it was a little predictable (1 viewing, 6/13/2020)"
858,Rating this one star just to bring the average score down. No way it should be so high. The movie is irritating with how illogical and predictable it is. There's no redeeming qualities to it.
859,"I don't see why people give this movie such praise, it doesn't deserve it. It was SO ridiculous, just her ex and his brother conspiring in an invisible suit to torment his ex girlfriend after she left him for being abusive, in the end she steals the invislbe suit and kills him. The End. That's all. So don't waste your time, it's rubbish and real stupid and unrealistic and just plain silly."
860,"When watching this movie i was mildly entertained. The tension of the invisible man being there or not was amusing, Much like those paranormal activity movies i kept looking if i could spot something.
However when i started thinking about the movie once it was over many plotholes came up. Many reviewers already mentioned them, the ones that stood out fhe most to me were the superstrength the invisible man seemed to have and that he was a ghost aswell. When he was fighting with people they couldnt feel him, grab on to him or hit him.
I missed the part of the story why she left him, what his goal was or the point of his suits (besides stalking her).
Also to me this movie felt like a jab at white men. Al the white men in the movie are evil or incompetent. Ofcourse the black guy is good and the victims are women.
Like many of the more recent movies this also is a woke piece of garbage, filled with plotholes and lack of story or character development. I would not recommend but if you do watch it, dont think about it."
861,"It was the tech version of Enough, without Jennifer Lopez's pathetic whining. ""Can't I hit my wife?"" JL, as pathetic as possible. ""Noooooo"" Taco flavored kisses. That all aside, I have to hate the male abuser and they gave me nothing. Maybe him slapping her around in the beginning in the middle of an exhibition, he put together explaining the suit. But no, you have to guess. The scene where she supposedly slapped the kid?! What kind of depth perception does this kid have? She slapped you from a lying position 3 ft away on the opposite side of your face? Dumb. Honestly, I like the lead. But she plays one character all the time. Kind of a Diane Keaton, if you will. I like her, but always the same thing. Underestimated, plain chick. Not overly attractive by American standards, but cleans up well. I don't agree this was political, but the characters seemed forced because there was no explanation, who they were, except the sister. Oh and being a sister and having a sister, if my sister wrote me a crappy email, we would be talking or fighting. Not ok, well I guess I'm all alone."
862,"I struggled the first hour to see if it would start heading somewhere interesting. It didn't. Struggled the second hour to see if it had any twists that worth my first hour struggle. It doesn't.
It's just a collection of stupid characters and situations, mixed with every cliche you can imagine.
Honestly too long to list all I didn't like, I can just tell I didn't like anything on this movie.
The 2 points come from the cinematography, that wasn't bad, all the rest was way below mediocre."
863,"This movie is incredibly bad. The original idea is ingenious and many great stories have come from it. But this story has no point. The motives for our main characters are weak and confusing. Everything about this movie is pure garbage and completely unbelievable. Laughable. The only storyline and characters that are enjoyable are the side character cop and daughter. Unfortunately, Miss Handmaid overdramatizes every single scene and the camera lingers on that unfortunate face for much too long, trying to build tension that doesn't exist.What is the point of this guy turning invisible and stalking her? Seriously. Watch the movie and try to find a clear motive. It's absolutely baffling that this movie has good reviews at all.And the ending is ridiculous. How do you so completely mess up a movie with such amazing potential?"
864,"... should have been the title for this movie; however, it was already taken. Moss does an excellent acting job; however, everyone has to be ""dumb"" for this plot to work. Don't waste your time on a predictable ""thriller"""
865,"There are so many holes in the plot of this film ""The Invisible Man"" that I would be able to create a new film containing only the flaws.
I only gave 3 stars because of the protagonist's performance. Only that."
866,"Wow! Extremely predictable. There were too many badly played out situations and plot mistakes to make this film worth the time.
The only reason I did not give it a ""1"" is the acting was marginal."
867,"Since the ""monster"" in this is invisible, in order to make it scary, I guess the director decided to cast Elisabeth Moss. She can really be in a horror movie without make up or a mask. It's frustrating to look her in the face, such an ugly face taking a lead role in a horror movie all this combined with bad acting, plot holes, stupid decisions etc. makes it a real horror like experience but in real life for the viewer - it takes time to recover. Because all that I give 2 out of 10."
868,Dont wanna waste time writing a review. Stars can summarize.
869,"...uninteresting. Like some other reviewers, I'm beginning to wonder if IMDB ratings aren't just paid advertising. There's no way this mess deserves a 7+ rating. Unlikable characters, major plot holes, slooooow story... All in all, I just didn't care how the story ended...just was happy when it finally did."
870,"Reviews talk about this movie being a reboot of ""The Invisible man"", a 1933 movie directed by James Whale, based on H.G. Wells novel with same title.
As a matter of fact, this 2020 film, rather than being compared to the '33 one, shows much more similarity with ""Sleeping with the enemy"", a 1991 movie, directed by Joseph Ruben, with Julia Robert and Patrick Bergin, adapted from a novel by Nancy Price: gist is the same, main difference is that in ""The invisible man"" the stalker is, obviously, invisible. So 2020 movie is a sort of combo between two good movies, the '33 and the '91 ones, but it does not succeed, unfortunately, to get to the level of either one, mainly because of the lack of creativity. Besides the great Elisabeth Moss performance, and some scary scene, everything is predictable - for me- and some part of the plot are without any logic or explanation, and, maybe, pace is bit too slow."
871,"It's as if ""sleeping with the enemy"" and ""hollow man"" got together and made a really crappy kid. So predictable...especially the ending. There's also little to no character development so I struggled to connect."
872,The best topic the worst movie. they ruined the topic by this movie
873,"Considering Leigh directed and wrote Upgrade, I thought this was going to be an awesome movie. Sadly it wasn't. It had a painfully slow start, a frankly ugly main character, and numerous plot holes. The last 1/3 of the movie was decent, the first 2/3 had me rolling my eyes. Not the reaction I was hoping for.Looking at the other movies he's made, I can only assume Upgrade just fluked out and we won't be seeing anything like it again."
874,"This movie was a bit thrilling and well- filmed for some of it, but near the end, it was starting to feel like it was just dragging on unnecessarily. I believe the last half hour or so were where it was getting kind of annoying. alright movie to watch, but do not expect this to be a masterpiece in cinematography."
875,"I was really looking forward to this. Now I've watched it I would not recommend this at all.
The story drags on until last 10 mins where it gets a bit exciting but not for long."
876,The acting was pretty good and you did start to question your predictions at a certain point but overall I'd say it's alright.
877,"She drugs her husband. Dog sets off car alarm. He somehow knows exactly which direction she went and catches up to her. she drops a bottle of drugs that she zipped up in her gym bag, and I was done. Such quality writing."
878,"I went in with zero expectations because usually over hyped films are just that. However this one started off strong, had some interesting concepts and then the general idea just went off the rails. It's like a weird, sci-fi, overly political attempt of remaking Double Jeopardy.Moss' portrayal of Cecilia was outstanding and that's probably the only redeeming quality of this film overall.Some characters just have no depth, like the part that irked me the most was the daughter who was clearly slapped by something invisible and she just blames Cecilia without any kind of attempt to understand what happened. Had she not been bffs with her the entire time leading up to this, one could believe that reaction to be normal. But the whole movie is filled with out of character moments from all the big players. Just weird.The sci-fi aspect was pretty cool. I have to say I liked that more than if it was paranormal. However the ideas became clunky, clumsy dialogue didn't help and then there was a bit of a messy ending that didn't really work with the rest of the film.The development of Cecilia from battered woman to bad ass was a bit too quick which I suppose had to be done for a movie but I would have liked a longer time lapse after 'Adrian's death'.Not a fantastic movie, but still worth a watch."
879,"I have several questions about the story...WARNING: SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!(Many story details are going to be given away in the next few paragraphs, so if you haven't seen the movie yet, read no further!)1) How exactly did brothers Adrian and Tom manage to fake Adrian's suicide to the satisfaction of the authorities? Did they kill some poor stranger who happened to resemble Adrian? This is never explained.2) Late in the movie, Tom confides to Cecilia that her legal problems will disappear if she agrees to carry her pregnancy to term and return to Adrian - but why, exactly, would the District Attorney agree to drop all charges against Cecilia when it looks as though she killed her sister?3) And even if Cecelia DID return to Adrian, how was Adrian planning to explain to the public that he was still alive? Was he planning to tell the world that it was all just an elaborate practical joke? And how would he explain the person who was cremated? Who was that person, anyway? And how did they die?4) And at the very end, when Adrian tied himself up and pretended to be Tom's captive, how did he know that Tom was going to be killed that night?"
880,"This movie is essentially a Hollow Man Rip off...though, I must admit, the acting and the storyline of this movie was a huge improvement over Hollow Man. Even though this premise is hardly original, there are a lot of genuinely terrifying and suspenseful moments throughout the movie. I may not have been surprised....BUT I was super entertained. I absolutely recommend seeing it in a theater, as i believe the movie theater and surround sound setting helped with building suspense during a lot of the film.... Overall, because of the acting and the effective suspense building techniques, this film earns a solid 7.5 in my opinion. If there is nothing else playing that catches your eye at the cinema, you most likely won't be disappointed with seeing this film."
881,"Why don't I see a black male and a black woman in these two roles and the white male that kills the malefic black male for bothering the black woman ?
ha ???"
882,"I was so scared it actually made me forget the pandemic for two hours! I didn't think anything could get my mind off our current scary real-world news. But this did, and it was wonderful, but terrifying. I thought several times maybe I should leave the theater because I just couldn't take it, but I'm glad I stayed. Wow! And I've seen plenty of thrillers, but this is among the best.Best not to let anyone tell you details about it beforehand."
883,"Plenty of suspense, great storyline and a superb cast to bring it all together!"
884,"Horrible movie, horrible acting. Here we go with all these type of movies. The man is stupid and devil and the women is abused and innocent then by the sudden at the end she becomes the strongest superhero that she can destroy every single man. Ok we got it. Enough making movies like that. All these type of movies have the same story and ending."
885,"I am adicted to movies, I tried to have an open mind, but this is one of the worst movies I ever saw."
886,"Good reboot concept, just not a fan of the execution."
887,"A heroine movie where the lead character is the lead because she is the victim. And a victim of what, we will never know. It is implied that her husband is a monster, while she is completely innocent. Even at the end, we still had no evidence on the husband, other than his general creepy attitude. Nothing within the movie showed us that he ever did anything wrong. All the while, she's incoherently bumbling around, milking her sob story and pity party.
It is assumed he was stalking her, but why, I don't know other than he desperately wants to have a baby with a woman who hates his guts. In addition, there's no backstory to make us hate him.
Also,we never get any information about this ""suit"", other than he must be some rich, closet, crazy genius, who invests millions into his man cave.
Ultimately, she goes nuts for an hour and goes game of thrones on him, then walks away with a sadistic smile. She's the scary one, and it's plain to see. Why did he marry her, and what was her job again? That's right, she's the good one and he's the bad guy, and she walks away with murder. Contrived and disappointing it is."
888,"THE INVISIBLE MAN !!!! 2020 CINEMATIC RELEASEWhat an amazing film to watch, an edge of your seat thriller that keeps you guessing even after the credits. The whole concept of the film, its feel, its darkness, its curiousity to the audiences blends in so well together to give you an atmosphere that blows anyones mind.The performance by Elizabeth Moss is phenomenal she makes the film even scarier. The cast were all incredible and i have loved everybit of this film. I will own soom another amazing piece of cinema. A well deserved 10/10.Just 1 annoying thing when someone tells you to drive, you drive you do not just stand there."
889,Very good acting...very good actress...so captivating debut i should have exited the theater 20 min before the end.....ruined talent so idiotic pathetic unrealistic boring and dull end. Worst end you can imagine// doubts of ultra feminism at the end
890,"I have no idea how this movie has such a good rating.I went to see this movie with my girlfriend and before we went I told her that I was interested to know why this girls boyfriend faked his own death and when I came out, the question seemed even more relevant.Here are some of the things I noticed during this movie:* everything is ridiculously noisy from the creaking of the trees to the creaking of the doors, the tapping of the floors as they are walked over, EVERY sound seems to be exaggerated which raises the question even more that if this guy in this invisibility suit is around her literally all the time, how can he possibly be so quiet when the slightest sound is so loud
* this girl, she is supposed to be frail, her boyfriend supposedly abused her mentally and physically although we see zero evidence of this and when he is finally in the movie at the end he doesnt come across like that at all, anyway, she is supposed to be frail, lacking in confidence, scared of her own shadow etc etc, this is even a plot point in the movie about how she cant go outside blah blah blah yet by the end of the movie she has turned into a stone cold killer...........it makes no sense to me that someone can transform themselves so drastically in terms of their behaviour when they are supposed to have been through so much
*back to the guy at the end of the movie, the boyfriend...........all through the movie they make a point that he is controlling, abusive, etc etc..........when she agrees to meet him at the end though, its her who is mentally abusing him. I say this because she is trying to coerce a confession from him even though we dont ever know if he has actually done anything at all wrong other than fake his own death............she basically has the character traits that she accuses him of having all throughout the movie
*so the guy kills himself and apparently his brother has been going round in this invisibility suit harassing this girl....why? what does he have against her? what does he have to gain? people may suggest the money, but we dont know what is meant to happen to the money if the girl does not get it, its never stated it would default to his brother so i think its wrong to assume that, so why bother, how well does he even know her............he said he hated his brother, so it makes sense to me that he probably would not be around him all that much in that instance, so likely would not know his brothers girlfriend that well, if at all
*the brother, acting as a lawyer, tells the girl he can get rid of her murder charges if she agrees to go back with his brother to have her baby with him (how do they even know she is pregnant?) , how exactly does he intend to get rid of this murder charge? should we just accept that he is able to do so and not question how?
*why would this girl want to keep the baby? she clearly is not in the right state of mind, she is unemployed, has no home...why would she do it?
*when she is put in the mental institute, am i supposed to believe that the cop she has been living in would then be part of the investigation? that there is no conflict of interest present?
*why would this girl want his money? surely if he is as bad as she made out, she would want nothing of his? sure money is good but so are morals, right?
*the boyfriend apparently knew everything, he knew what she was thinking before she said anything, he knew she was on birth control without her telling him and was able to switch the pills..........yet he didnt know about her little hiding stash inside his own wardrobe..........
*the movie relies on jump scares
*the movie is blindingly predictable..........of course it was his brother in the suit, of course the girl is going to suit up at the end and kill the guy, and of course when she does so she is going to use his little catchphrase ""surprise""..........so predictable
*the registration plate of the cops car changes
*invisibility suit also seems to have super stealth and enhanced strength
*the girl suggests that although the brother was caught in the suit, that it was in fact her bf and only at the end became his brother.........this is never explained nor is it ever specified one way or the other whether this is true or not
*the cop at the end, ridiculous, he knows she just murdered someone and if he doesnt he is a moron, he sees the suit, he sees her demeaner yet he allows her to just walk away
*why would the boyfriend leave her 5 million in the first place
thats the stuff i can think of off of the top of my head anyway, of course there are plenty more, but this movie is filled with holes left right and centre, the acting is poor and in some cases questionable and over acting especially by the black copit seems the writer expects us all to just blindly accept what is put in front of us with no questions asked, its very lazy writing, very unskilled writingi am not particularly a fan of the horror genre, i have never seen a ""horror"" movie that i thought to be ""horrifying"" but none the less, i would not place this movie into the category of horror, certainly not sci fi either........id call it a thrillerit also gripes me that this movie is called ""the invisible man"", after all, we are all already familiar with ""the invisible man"" as a character........he does not have some suit that makes him that way..........to me its just called that to piggy back off of an already established franchise to try and gain extra hype.......again, to me, this is lazy and unskilledthroughout the movie the girl does a pretty good job of coming across as insane (and an idiot) but she claims her boyfriend made her that way etc etc, would be nice to see some evidence of this, somewhere, anywhere..........otherwise, could it not be the case that actually, she is just insane, she is just imagining things and its her who is the unhinged killer.......maybe it really was her who slit her sisters throat but we are seeing it from her warped perspective and she doesnt believe it was her due to her insanity?anyway, i cant be bothered to write any more than this, i think i have said enough.........its not a good movie unless you are the type of drone who likes movies purely because they are classed as horror, who can believe quite literally anything whether there is evidence or not - if you tick those boxes you will probably love it but if you have the ability to ask questions then i doubt it is going to be for youi have just realised why this movie is rated so highly..........most people are idiots, we all know this to be true, right?"
891,"A very boring movie with a very simple story and very poor acting. Some, nowadays simple, special effects that won't wow anyone. Acting is plain and predictable. The invisible man should have been called invisible ninja because not only he is invisible, he dodges bullets, and beats everyone with one or two punches, twists hands and places knives in other people's hands with incredible ability, off course he is invisible all the time so no one know how he manages to do all that. Don't waste your time. This movie is. Ot worth it"
892,Cheap feminist trash with a bad ending.The story was so predictable and bad.
893,"I really like the original ""Invisible Man"" movie, and was hoping that this remake would bring a fresh update of this classic movie monster. I never saw Leigh Whannell's previous movie, ""Upgrade,"" but am aware that he is well-respected among fans of genre films. As a result, I was hoping that this would be a unique and contemporary endeavor. While the film isn't terrible by any means, it's unfortunately not too special either.In this remake, Elisabeth Moss plays a professional reeling from a traumatic and abusive relationship. She finds herself being haunted by an invisible man who seems to be her ex. The film has a very strong opening scene that uses both cinematography and suspense extremely well, but unfortunately goes a bit downhill from there. The characters are decently well-developed, but you still never really feel for most of them. The film's script is a bit of a mixed bag, with decent dialogue and pacing but a rather formulaic plot structure and a number of rather pointless scenes. To his credit, Whannell uses sound design effectively and appropriately to generate genuine suspense at times. He even uses jump-scares very well (and I normally don't like those.) The score is also generally pretty good and impactful. Despite his best efforts at suspense, the film itself isn't all that memorable because it is so easy to see where it is going after the first few scenes. The attempts at plot twists and foreshadowing end up falling flat. Like ""Knives Out"" and ""Joker"" (two other well-received films that I was more mixed on than many people,) the movie thinks it's more creative and clever than it actually is. 6/10Note: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema. In terms of presentation quality, this might be one of my best Dolby Cinema experiences, right up there with ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse."" The rumble and the moving audio were both used incredibly well and in very unique ways. The picture and sound quality were also both outstanding."
894,"I enjoyed movie a lot An intense,Engaging Thriller, i surprised why get many bad reviews? Even movie was quite good, Because many bad men cannot digest why shown facts that a women abused,Stalk by her white male bf ,many bad Male Ego get hurt & they start to blaming #metoo compain,is enough to proved world full of cheap men thats why against #metoo a good movement"
895,"The ability to build an invisible suit is not far fetched but this plot is. They should have called it The Invisible Man meets Sleeping with the Enemy. Hard to believe a multimillionaire genius obsessing over mouse-y Elizabeth Moss (Julia Roberts yes). Oh, if only one of the dozen or so people that are attacked would grab on! Somehow the invisible suit makes him Superman in strength and speed. Ridiculous plot twists and action. Waste of Moss's talents and our time."
896,"The main female actress did a GREAT job at playing her character. She knew and it's not easy to portray that very well. I won't give spoilers, but I liked this movie. I figured out a couple of things, but that didn't matter because it was well done for what it is. Old story with a modern twist...didn't make me jump out of my skin but it had a creepy feeling...worth a watch. I mean, I put down my tablet to watch it and usually I'm surfing during movies."
897,"""The Invisible Man"" is a lot of fun. It has quite a few scares. The cast does a nice job. The movie has a nice look too. I felt a little let down when it was over but I don't want to nitpick because I had good time watching this movie. I planned on seeing ""The Invisible Man"" when it was in the theater but it didn't work out. As I watched the movie last night I imagined how scary it must have been in the theater. Shame on me."
898,"Suspended all disbelief, because nothing happens like in reality in this movie. People only react like they do for the plot to work. Too many unbelievable situations and outcomes. Go watch the original movie, at least that had charm."
899,"This movie has its high rating because of abused All the women who loved the idea of the suit! I won't believe anything else said in the reviews! I struggled to stay awake during 3/4 Of the movie although there were some audio jump-scares But it just did not make me interested until the very end of the movie ! Anyway, as i was saying; loved the suit."
900,"Don't believe the bad reviews. They are literally attacking this good movie for some reasons, probably related to competition. The beginning is strong. The first half hour is a bit slow, but it does a good job installing the bases of the story. It's a lot about control. About controlling individuals. It describes with precision the psyche of those psychopaths. Moss is fantastic as usual. She delivers fantastically. An overall really nice suspense."
901,"Glad I only rented this mess, how it got a 92% fresh and over 7 star rating is well beyond me. The entire film was Swiss cheese, by that I mean illogical plot holes that never get filled and just keep coming. The writers for this film clearly though all other humans are idiots or are themselves extremely lazy and just pushed out the first outline available. It's a hot mess. I didn't like it from the first irritating scene and it never improved.The idea was great, acting was ok but irritating at times and the directing was good. But overall execution of the film was shoddy. If you want to read about plot holes there's a hundred other posts highlighting them.Do not buy this mess! It's barely a 1-time watch and I'd advise waiting for it to be free."
902,"I have waited to see this movie think it was going to be good. I was absolutely wrong, it wasnt good alot. It's slow as hell, not enough action or thrill to it. It could have been alot better!"
903,"If you like a suspenseful horror movie with a good plot, this is it not. In fact the first hour is boring to say the least and the rest is eventually a killing feast.If you give this movie a try, most will conclude this opinion is no lie. Many years ago horror stories gave viewers a fright, but this movie does not even bite.In fact it is nothing else but a bagful of utter boring nonsense."
904,"Very poor story... very average acting...Why recreated the concept of Hollowman in such a bad avatar?Watched it looking at the rating on IMDB, but surely it is not a correct reflection of the movie quality.Avoid it."
905,"I'll be straight up. I love horror, suspense, thrillers, and just about any genre of movie there is as long as the story is good and the actors do a brilliant job of convincing me of their roles. Sadly this movie has none of it. It was incredibly slow in the beginning first half, most of it was predictable, and the build up towards the ending was sub-par.I did laugh though. The effects look so fake it was beyond ridiculous. Honestly, it's like a really cheap B rated rip off of the movie Hollow Man (which I thought was pretty damn good).The ending was a joke. Was that supposed to be a twist? I have no idea how people have given this such a high review. Seriously a 7.2 right now? I could give you the names of at least a dozen movies in any genre related to this film that are all miles beyond compare.Honestly, I'd rather watch a lot of B-rated movies. A lot I've seen are way better than this movie. I'm shocked that this is the same director that directed Upgrade (shockingly a good movie). Sadly the only other popular movie he directed was Insidious 3, not anywhere near as good as the first Insidious. I guess with him it could be a hit or miss, mostly miss it seems like. I don't consider being an executive producer for the Saw movie series as direct hands on role to make a difference of what is shown on screen.You don't have to take my word for it though, if you want to waste 2 hours of your life, then please by all means go ahead and see if you can even watch it till the end without wanting to turn it off halfway through. Sadly I was a glutton for punishment so I stayed only to be utterly disappointed."
906,"The reviews are payd. Do not waste your time.
The movie is boring and out of logic."
907,"I was disappointed. The movie started bit awkwardly, So he was a famous scientist that didn't show any prototypes of his invention to the public ? he just sits and make the suit without any failed attempts? he specifically made that to abuse her? and he finally lost to her somehow, did he forget that he owned another suit? why was the brother in such hurry to kill her?!! why did Adrian's brother go on a rampage and kill all those guards he could have used her hand to shoot, horrible movie everything was so rushed it feels unfinished. Not sure what the other brother's motive was!! The fact she didn't take Adrian's phone from the attic as a proof (pictures of Sid and Cecilia sleeping) almost ruined it for me. this was just a bad film with tons of plot holes and apparently lots of affordable one size fits all invisible suits, sisters who die immediately etc."
908,"And once again, abominable!
I was surprised to find no redeeming qualities in the movie, horrible acting, 2 dimensional characters, weak storyline."
909,"Dear white males, if you get confused about what your watching just remember the the protagonist, the evil invisible force, is you, the toxic white male patriarchal ogre that should be destroyed."
910,"The first hour is incredibly sleep-inducing, good to play in the background as you try to fall asleep. Some parts of the character's reactions were also very unbelievable. I personally was annoyed by the protagonist too. After the first hour it got a little better (but not by much) and finally some stuff happened but it certainly wasn't worth waiting for an hour."
911,"I have nothing against the concept of a twist at the end of a movie, but the twist HAS TO MAKE SENSE. Elizabeth Moss' acting was very good and kept me interested until that totally absurd ending which utterly ruins the whole movie and insults the intelligence of anyone watching it with a modicum of common sense. A low blow.Dreadfully disappointing movie."
912,"Just horrible, I can't believe this is a +7 rated horror movie.. did they pay for the high ratings ?? just don't watch it"
913,"Good beginning, poor middle, terrible ending. Endless plot holes. Don't waste your time like I did."
914,Found her husband locked in the basement more than a month ? How the hell is he still alive. Plus with all the killings esp at the restaurant you would think there's a surveillance camera?!?!!!
915,It had some really good moments of tension; but the approach they took with the story could have been better.
916,"The premise was good. The story was also good during the film, with some strange behaviors from the main character. She's so frightened she can't get out of the house, but she sees a ghost and she doesn't get that scared, not even a slight scream.
At the end the characters change personalities. The bad is good, the good is bad. That's so stupid. Characters don't change so abruptly. It ruins the films that ¬øtwist? Come on!
3/10"
917,"THis movie is a perfect example of how you can ruin a perfectly good idea, with small mistakes. Like it was made for 5-years old that does not notice that the car that crashed a second a go is now looking like it came out of a dealership.
And that poor excuse of an acting...tragically.
Nothing is scary, and everything is predictable and naive, like the director never came out of puberty... too bad"
918,"If you can look past extremely obvious plot holes, you're sure to enjoy this movie. Has some very interesting ideas and scenes that weren't used as effectively as they could have been. Just couldn't get fully on board with the premise when it's foundation was so shaky."
919,"This is what happens when you throw a bunch of 2nd rate TV actors (I implore you to look at their IMDb resumes - all quite unimpressive) into roles in which they all try to overact. This film is a bumbling mess.It begins with some curiosity; an opening that has been xerox-ed from ""Sleeping With the Enemy""; dark, stormy night, woman desperately trying to get away from abusive man/relationship. After you say, ""Ah, I've seen this before"", it only goes downhill from there. The acting is quite atrocious. The lead, played by Elisabeth Moss, is an unconvincing girlfriend of a rich optics entrepreneur, who could have any girl he chooses but who mysteriously chose this dour-looking, frumpy, annoying thing. She is the overreaching lead in any of your high-school plays; acting for attention from her drama teacher but failing miserably. I don't see a deep run for Ms. Moss in the film industry. Her sister, played by Harriet Dyer, another no-name TV actress, is a smarmy sorority type who is annoyed by anyone who dare disrupt her unseen perfect life. Every role here is massacred by TV-rate acting. The invisible suit emits an annoying Predator-esque sound when the unseen foe moves in the room, removing any modicum of suspense. Unseen needs to be unheard as well and the film lacks any serious editing and feels, again, like a cheap TV movie. The ending tries to be a dramatic, symphonious reveal that would not surprise even the most devoted Bachelor or Kardashian watcher. Do not be fooled by the excellent and intriguing trailer. They should have put that on a 2-hour loop to gain an extra star from me.Don't waste your time."
920,"If you love seeing movies where the plots are 100% dependent on characters omitting huge chunks of critically important explanation from dialogues that any reasonable person would bring up as their first points of discussion in such situations then this could be the movie for you.""Go to his basement & you will see that he has a bunch of inventions & devices down there, i can work out the code to the locked doors down there"" (which she later proves) ""Down there you will find evidence that he is able to make himself invisible."" ... at about the 10 minute mark this piece of critical information is - for absolutely no explainable reason - omitted from a discussion in which Cecilia is desperately trying to prove that she is at enormous risk. This one sentence, which any idiot who was in such a position of terrifying risk would immediately say, would change the actions of everyone around her & result in none of the remaining actions of the film occurring.The film also features character attributes being developed - eg. intelligence, clarity of mind under pressure etc - & then arbitrarily abandoned at later points in the film to once again allow the plot to continue.Security cameras seen in shots which would have definitely captured footage of the titular character are not reviewed - or even mentioned - by people casting doubt around his existence. Yet later in the film a security camera is used as a pivotal plot device.10 or more men are beaten - some even killed - by the invisible man in a high security state hospital & still the cop who is wrapping this all up (who also was himself beaten by an invisible man who was then shot in his living room revealing the suit etc) is all like ""you shot the suit so it doesn't work now - there will still be doubts about your innocence"" etc.Also, as another reviewer wrote - in any film set in modern times that features smartphones (as this film does) if you don't explain why a smartphone was not used in any situation where it could be that is effectively a plot hole. She pours coffee all over the ground, even throws paint on him, but at no point thinks to use the phone that she has in her hand to film him?She also gets his phone in her hand, found in the house she is staying in after he is meant to be dead. She finds photographs on that phone of herself sleeping in that very house - which would unequivocally prove that someone had been there - & she just pops it back down on the floor & leaves it. Not in her pocket to show someone later.Etc etc.I know that it is a work of fiction & does ask that we suspend our disbelief but this shouldn't apply to how characters ought to behave. It felt like very lazy script writing. There were some good moments of tension & suspense but all in all i was honestly left wondering why Elizabeth Moss agreed to do it."
921,"This movie definitely scares you. It's not just jumpscares or loud noises, it's something psychological. From the first opening shot, you're immediately put inside Elisabeth Moss' character Cecilia's head. She is stuck in an abusive relationship and can't get out of it. The whole opening scene makes you uncomfortable as we see Cecilia trying to make her escape. This kind of tension is kept on throughout the film.Another thing this film succeeds upon is the writing. The story progresses in a fast paced way which doesn't seem hurried. The 2hr runtime feels achieved. There's definitely more than one 'WTF' moment in this film to keep you on the edge of your seat.The score and the sound design definitely puts you in Cecilia's shoes as you struggle with her to point out where exactly the invisible man might be. The camera work is exquisite, I mean did we really doubt the director who brought us Upgrade? The action sequences definitely feel thrilling and the way it's shot makes you feel like you're living it.I thought about it a lot and I can't really think of anything that didn't work. Some of you might complain about the camera work and how it focuses on the actor's faces more than the action but to me that worked. I think that definitely sold the drama. All and all this was a terrific film, really made the universal monster scary by mixing the monster with a relevant story."
922,"Movie about a guy being invisible could've gone into the cliche category. But this one avoided it. This movie didn't even remind me of Hollow Man.The villain's presence is only made felt to us. For the most part he is not shown. We are effectively told how cruel and cunning he is and it only builds to his character development.The heroine did a wonderful job.There were some plot holes here and there, but I'd forgive it.Avoiding the cliches and giving us an entertaining flick in itself is big achievement. Kudos to the team."
923,Not sure I understand who is reviewing this movie. A pile of dung covered by an implausible and impossible outcome. Just ick...
924,"Good opening then everything seem clear and already known whats going to happen . It could be ended after 1 hr or 1:15 but no it had to be 2 hrs which was so boring .
It could have been done much much better but you had to make it like this
Thank you"
925,"I don't know why this movie is 2hr long.
Its very boring movie dont watch it and waste your time."
926,"Great film with a genuinely original plot. One of those films that could be filmed on a tiny budget and remain similarly as tense. The film's most intense scenes were built on context alone, which is testament to the fantastic plot building and tension building techniques displayed expertly throughout the beginning of the film. The occasional plot hole can be ignored as situation films such as these shouldn't be shackled- because essentially this film was made with the purpose to keep the viewer on edge, and, by sacrificing some logic, they did it to a much higher effect.Massively exceeded my expectations and has actually changed my outlook on what a film needs to do be tense, simplicity is key!"
927,"Average really
Hollowman which was made a good number of years before is betterMain lead actress was really good though"
928,"As most have written here, its clever at points and there is a real sense of suspense and drama at times. There are some pretty big plot holes though as explained in other reviews.For me, the biggest plot hole is how can he follow her around all the time? How does he eat or go to the toilet? Having worn an all in one on my stag do, I can confirm that there is no grace when it comes to going to the toilet in one. It is frightening for all the wrong reasons, I mean imagine if the security guards walked into the toilets with his suit around his ankles.I would also hate to see what his fluid intake is. How did he brush his teeth and wash, never mind seeing him, could tell where he is from body odour and bad breath. No wonder the dog sensed him, jesus, there would be flies following him around.For those that care, i was dressed as an umpa lumpa, now that was scary."
929,"Great movie, great story. But a bit slow and 1.5 ours was long enough instead of 2."
930,"As a thriller, The Invisible Man is well intentioned and crafted with moderate competence--a machine designed to take you breathlessly from one scene to the next, your emotions shattered but logic intact. The story is familiar enough, not so much because of it's namesake, the original 1933 The Invisible Man starring Claude Rains, but it's resemblance to 1991's Sleeping with the Enemy.At least these filmmakers are smart enough to know that if a woman is going to be repeatedly placed in peril, she had better be the heroine and headline the film, even if from the very moment the film begins Cecilia Kass (Elizabeth Moss) is a woman who is determined to no longer be a victim. She escapes her house by the sea and sleeping husband (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) by running away in the middle of the night. No backstory is offered, we just observe the bleeding edge tech lab as she painstakingly disables each security feature from a single laptop, and from this we surmise that hubby must be a bad dude who is rich and has a playroom less transgressive but sadly more boring than Christian Grey. There are other minute glimpses of his character which suggest his general unfitness for marriage, but these assumptions still do not demystify him in the least. He isn't even a one dimensional character--he truly remains invisible, a cipher whose actions and motivations remain largely unknown for the majority of the film.Cecilia finds safe haven with a single father cop friend (Aldis Hodge) who happens to have no personality or backstory beyond what I just described. Her new domestic life is portrayed by her being afraid to go outside to get the mail. Sooner rather than later the plot thickens when bad hubby's brother/executor (Michael Dorman) shares the tragic(?) news that hubby is dead, and willed five million to Cecelia paid out a month at a time for about four years.By now we all know what is going on, even if we don't know how or why, but it is more or less fun to watch. Here these scenes draw from better and more notable films like Poltergeist and The Shining, and ultimately we are the better for it. Cecilia is stalked and seemingly gaslighted through a plot that twists but never quite turns dull.Elizabeth Moss delivers a tour-de-force performance. If you are like me, it is quite possible you have already witnessed countless hours of her degradation and determined glares directly into the camera on ""The Handmaid's Tale"". Though the material in that series is arguably better fare in every way, in this film, Moss leads us to scenes which may seem far too contrived to be plausible, however she herself remains totally and utterly believable throughout every frame. Her pitch-perfect performance does not make The Invisible Man a particularly significant film in the scheme of things, but it does establish that she is a film actor of the highest significance because she carries this film completely on her back.Trust me, if she wasn't in this, it wouldn't be worth watching."
931,"No character development makes you keep asking the question - why? You have to imagine the relationships that drive the motivations behind each character's behavior. I'm trying not to give spoilers - would be viewers, just don't expect to understand the motives and enjoy a mediocre ride. It won't be too bad if you do that. For goodness sake, don't pay for it if you can't watch it for free."
932,Started off really good then died half way through. Wasted my time watching this.
933,Only thing you need to know is how in the holy plot does he always know where she is and unless he has a wonder woman jet there's no way he got there that fast.
934,"Awesome movie, story, fight schenes, twist and turns. Hilarious thst movie was sick.. Really liked it............"
935,"A masterclass in nerve-wracking tension & paranoia-inducing suspense that grabs your attention from its opening frame and doesn't let go until the end, The Invisible Man is one of the most refreshing & riveting films to come out this year. As intense as it is terrifying, this timely spin on a classic source material is a relentless assault on the senses and is single-handedly elevated by a powerhouse performance from Elisabeth Moss.Written & directed by Leigh Whannell, the premise is a simple one yet is executed so ingeniously & effectively that the interest & investment in the film only amplifies as it progresses. The script weaves the entire plot around the protagonist's trauma and Whannell's clever & calculated direction helps keep things tense & focused at all times. Camerawork & editing is immaculate throughout, and the level of anxiety it's able to evoke from empty spaces is almost unbearable.Neat production design, foreboding atmosphere, first-rate sound & menacing score add their own bits to intensify the viewing experience but the most impressive of all aspects is Elisabeth Moss' performance. The fear, agony, confusion & nervousness is articulated with such emotional authenticity that it adds tremendous weight to her character, which in turn gives the film its emotional stakes and compels us invest in her plight. It isn't just Moss' facial expressions that's spot-on here but also her voice & body language.Overall, The Invisible Man is a tense, taut & thrilling nightmare that not only delivers as an edge-of-the-seat chiller but also serves as a harrowing reminder of the lasting ramifications of an abusive relationship. A smart, scary & sophisticated delight that's as intelligent as it is unsettling, this sci-fi horror is effortlessly steered by career-best work from both Whannell & Moss, and easily ranks amongst the finest films of 2020. Starting on a spine-chilling note and concluding with a sweet & satisfying finale, this is top-quality work from start to finish."
936,I just went mad with the suspense. Scenes as such that i have to literally make noise to react on it. I ended looking around time and again to find if someone's there beside me. Thought to be a common thriller flick but this became a game turner. I felt more of a horror thing here.
937,"THE INVISIBLE MAN is another pretty good sci-fi/horror movie combo from Leigh Whannell, whose previous effort, UPGRADE, was similarly enjoyable. This turns out not to be a remake of the Universal classic at all but rather a look at abusive relationships and gaslighting. A lot of the goodwill comes from Whannell's understated directorial style and Elizabeth Moss's performance, which is very strong and very physical. It's a slightly overlong production with one twist too many for my liking, but there's plenty of suspense punctuated by the occasional set-piece (including a TERMINATOR 2-inspired bit in a mental hospital which is really good) that makes this work a treat."
938,"Review(sober): ""Works as a decent social commentary on cyber bullying""Review(üêù): ""This chick is clumsy"""
939,"Although I enjoyed The Invisible Man (Elizabeth Moss is a really good screen actor), I was a bit disappointed with the story: I did expect at least one (more?) twist. And I really must say that if that happened to me in a restaurant I don't think I'd be able to recover - no matter how much psychiatric help was offered.
So, I did enjoy it, but it wasn't quite as good as I'd hoped - and were it not for some nice character performances I don't think I'd have got through it."
940,Watch if you want but don't stay up like people have said starts ok but it's just a bad film
941,Started off slow but picked up a little in the second half. Not terrible but definitely not great either. A solid 6 that I probably would recommend with caution to a friend
942,"Its a nice scifi, thriller, terror story with continuous dark ambience throughout the whole movie. Elisabeth Moss performance is quite good. She plays the role of a youg girl with mental disorders related to her previous relationship that will haunt her... till the end.
In general terms i enjoyed it but i at some point the movie lacks credibility. Maybe i just didn't like the scifi influences."
943,Liked the film and the story. Some great acting in my opinion and kept me hooked throughout!
944,"Unsure why this movie is seen as a horror, the only horrific thing about it is when we don't know what paranormal activity is happening, until we actually find out it's just a man in a suit. Maybe if Adrian was actually dead and it was his ghost haunting her it might have been more scary, but I would see this as a thriller movie."
945,"Leigh Whannel's ""The Invisible Man"" has done what the The Dark Universe's ""The Mummy"" failed to: bring interest back to a classic Universal monster while also being an engaging and well-crafted horror film. Rife with stand out acting performances, especially from the film's star Elisabeth Moss who practically carries the film with her incredible portrayal of a woman suffering from PTSD and paranoia, sequences of breath-stopping suspense as Cecelia (Moss), and the audience, are psychologically stalked and toyed with by her invisible adversary, and tight, purposeful direction from Whannel, fresh of the back of his previously acclaimed film ""Upgrade"", ""The Invisible Man"" is another solid and stand out entry into Whannel's filmography of ever-growing horror classics.
8.5/10"
946,"While the overall story was good, the movie couldn't keep my attention for the first half. It improved, but very slowly."
947,We see that if they shown us someone built a suit with cameras for whole invisible movie is tilted towards technical generation and showing how we can inventing things but at the same time they are not believing her instead of watching cctv recording? Ans at the end of movie she remember that there is cctv means she was suggest this thing before somehow he might get capture like in hotel while he was killing her sister? But no one keeping cctv cameras in hotel in California great so i gave it 5 because actord did well their work only script sucks. Few things are so advance and few like 19th century. So this thing makes audience feels they are some kind of idiot which is unable to figure it out.
948,"Finally got to see a movie on big screen. Although, I didn't like the trailer very much. The concept too seemed uninteresting and looked like using similar template as hollow man and a few other movies. A google search said its a remake, I haven't seen any of the previous films. But man I was wrong, I enjoyed a lot. One reason for this could also be the big screen, Dolby Atmos experience after ages. A technically brilliant film with outstanding cinematography, sound design, production design. The sound/music of the film deserves special mention. Although, the film dealt with a few logical issues, and inconsistencies in screenwriting, especially during the second half. But the brilliance in filmmaking and performances compensates for it. Am excited to see what Leigh Whannell does next."
949,"I began watching this movie with high hopes. I saw 7+ stars on IMDB and I figured it would be good. The first half of the movie was good and definitely suspenseful with the 'fear you can't see' vibe. Anxiety inducing for sure. Then came the second half.The jumping of the shark was the sister being killed, how could that go unseen? Among all the other massive continuity errors, the cellphone in the addict, the suit in closet, her bruises from him beating her up in the kitchen and explain to me how she hit the daughter while she was laying on the ground?I literally didn't even finish the movie because I couldn't keep watching. One hour in and I was looking to see how much longer it was on for because I was confused why it kept going. If this movie was 30 mins shorter with the excessive about of extra and over the top stuff taken out, it would have been better.I wanted to like this movie but it is just so ridiculous and outlandish that it is almost unwatchable to anyone who actually pays attention and watches the movie. Don't waste your time with this one until they come out with a directors cut, and it should be a cut."
950,"Ok, -Elisabeth Moss great as usual. Pretty good acting all around- setting-directing- everything above average except- the story? The writing is not good. Sorry Leigh. Not believable even for science fiction. Don't get me wrong- the invisible suit part- that was good. Optics? Brilliant. But the villian (s)? People simply don't behave this way. This is not normal human behavior (even for a mad scientist/and his brilliant lawyer brother). Insane people do better. Scenes don't play out like this in real life. It's cartoonish. ------------ And the girl herself- at first- a coward, cry baby, whinning around like a idiot- but then- all of a sudden- she's a courageous goddess of a super action hero. People don't change like that. It's like two different people. Oh irony. Oh I could go on. Either just terrible writing or just writing the same old tired plagiarized Hollywood story you know will sell and make money, I can't tell. Well, they did pretty good with the crap story they had i guess or I would not have given it a 5."
951,"Another very much predictable movie with another seen before plot. Isn't Hollywood capable of making new real interesting original stories anymore?
The only good part of it is that you can watch it on fast forward All the way through and still not lose a bit of the plot."
952,"Upteenth retelling of H.G. Wells' classic suffers from an overwhelming sense of d√©j√† vu and a preponderance of portentous camera moves. Moss is good as a woman struggling to convince everyone that her abusive ex-partner (and genius scientist, natch) is back after apparently committing suicide, and the film seems to have something to say in a post-#MeToo climate, but any message is lost amid the stultifying pace and plotholes you could drive a truck through."
953,"Above all, I liked the slow burn pace of the picture which was totally in place."
954,"Had high hopes for this but it was ruined by poor acting. The lead became very very annoying and tedious after the first 15 minutes with her painful expressions and her best mate cop and his daughter I'm sure had no previous acting experience. It got a bit better as it went on but don't waste your money renting this, wait until it's on Netflix for a wet afternoon. Are there ANY good films made anymore, they just seem to churn out trash to make money."
955,"Everything was great but I don't know why the director uses the security cameras when he wants???
Where are the cameras in the restaurant"
956,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningCecilia Kass (Elizabeth Moss) lives in fear of her husband Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) and one night manages to escape his clutches. A year later, she's living with her old friend James (Aldis Hodge), a cop, and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid) when she hears from Adrian's brother Tom (Michael Dorman) that he has committed suicide. And yet, Cecilia still feels she is not free of his shackles, and as a series of dark events happen around her, and her relationship with her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer) falters, she comes to learn that he is still there.Just before cinema screens around the country (and, indeed, the world) went dark in March, writer/director Leigh Whannell's modern day update of the classic H.G. Wells science fiction tale was one of the last to make a big splash, opening to fairly glowing reviews. Despite a cast of largely unknowns, it looked set to do fairly good business nonetheless, but now critical acclaim is the best it can really hope for. It's that it's not as good as it could have been that is its biggest failing, the squandered potential painfully undeniable.In the #MeToo times, Whannell attempts to take the story beyond the standard realms of traditional sci-fi, and use it to serve as a metaphor for the lasting impact of domestic violence, giving it a social heart that will strike a chord with many. In the beginning, he certainly creates an effective sense of atmosphere and increasing claustrophobia, with some simple long, lingering silent shots, and panoramic use of the camera. But then in the second act, it just degenerates into a pretty standard, goofy slasher pic, with everyone acting in a manner that wouldn't be out of place in one of the later Halloween movies.If it hadn't been so overlong and overindulgent, it might have been a really clever, unique spin on a classic horror tale. To a large extent, it still is, but what you're left with is a long, messy production of what could have been perfect. ***"
957,"Let me make this perfectly clear: this is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a very long time.And why didn't Tom Cruise & Co use THIS for their failed Universal Monster's Universe launch? As a matter of fact, this WAS my favorite Universal Monster movie of the 1930/40s.I knew I would like this. But I had no idea HOW much I would. And I knew main star Elisabeth Moss, who reminded me of a grown-up version of Milly Shapiro from Hereditary, had to carry this entire movie on her back, but I doubted I would believe her. Well...Superman: The Movie's tagline was: ""You will believe a man can fly."" I believed in all of this.In the first few minutes, the rules, setting, temperature, mood, fear, suspense and story is set. This was so masterfully directed, I got 100% the feel of everything I needed to know in that basically first minute, without any dialogue, exposition or tricks. As much as I like Writer/Director Leigh Whannell's other works, this is his perfection.Cecilia's trying to escape her abusive and controlling Elon Musk of a husband and barely does. Later, she will learn of his suicide which normally would set her free and make her feel less afraid of him coming after her. But, did he really die? Or can he still try and control her from his grave?I only gave you 1/10th of the story. SEE for yourself the rest. Why not? The price has dropped on the VOD and the movie has great acting, special effects, INCREDIBLE and EFFECTIVE jump-scares (one had my heart pounding so much - no spoilers, but remember a ladder,) a killer score, twists upon twists and despite some minor plot holes, it's plausible enough with the outrageous premise.I believe only approximately one or two out of dozens of horror movies are near perfect each year. This 2020 year is unique, but luckily this was in the can and out before the blank hit the fan. Lucky for us all as this was released and is an absolute MUST-SEE.Okay. I know, I know. Enough with the puns on the title.***Final thoughts: My two regrets here: Not SEEING (sorry, I made no promises!) this in theatres when we still had theatres in America and not paying the large price when it first landed on VOD. I really wanted to see this after missing it on the big screen, but when this pandemic happened and they started to release new theatrical films to home streaming, this was $19.99. I couldn't believe it and vowed I would never pay that to see a movie.Later it would be explained that's a bargain for families/couples who would've gone to see it in theatres. I.E. People, I guess, generally would spend much more on parking, babysitters, gas, concessions, ticket prices, etc. Me being single, I would've spent $5 on a Saturday morning matinee. But, then again, I'm not a family and I did miss it in theatres..."
958,After the failure of Universal's Dark Universe franchise. Director Leigh Whannell has rebooted it with a reinterpretation of The Invisible Man story.This is not a movie of a man driven mad with his experiments regarding invisibility gone wrong.Optics scientist and tycoon Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) is an abusive boyfriend of Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) who has made elaborate plans to escape from him.A few weeks after leaving. Cecilia finds out that Adrian has committed suicide from his attorney who is also his brother. She has been left a hefty amount of money with some conditions.However Cecilia is uneasy and thinks that Adrian might not be dead and is stalking her somehow. Her sister and cop friend James disbelieve her.Of course Adrian has created an invisibility suit and plans to take revenge on Cecilia for daring to leave him. After all it is called The Invisible Man.Whannel has created a stalker thriller. The abusive power play could be a reference to #Me Too as well. Rich moguls ruining the careers of women who refuse to stay silent.Ironically The Invisible Man's box officer was curtailed by the Coronavirus pandemic. An invisible airborne virus which proved to be deadlier.The film is very flawed and so many times it comes across as stupid.. There is so much Cecilia could had done to reveal her see through stalker. A taser gun would had disabled him.By the end it becomes a slasher film with a twist that enables Cecilia to finally turn the tables.
959,"A modern version of a classic film; You have probably seen the invisible man... Let me rephrase that, you are probably aware of the invisible man... Let me try that again...A woman is tortured by mysterious invisible happenings that could be her imagination of it could be her abusive and controlling bully of an ex-partner. Can she convince people that she is not mad... or has she lost the plot already?This is an interesting twist on a classic film, updating it by using technology to replace old fashioned science. Elizabeth Moss does abused, crazy and fragile woman on the edge of cracking up really well. Using domestic violence was an interesting twist and is all too relevant in modern times. As the vehicle for the film she has a really strong performance and delivers with authenticity.A few plot holes made me question the strength of the film at times, but they were only minor as I was able to cast them off throughout and just focus on the events of the film. There was lots of tension throughout which proves that you do not necessarily need to see the monster or bad guy to ramp up tension for the audience. Sure, there was CGI towards the end of the film where the 'monster' was shown, but thankfully it did not look that out of place.I enjoyed this film and would have no problem recommending it to others. If I was honest with myself though, I have enjoyed other ""Invisible"" films more so. This was decent, but it was not the best one I have seen. 6 out of 10."
960,"This remake of the 1933 classic based on the H.G. Wells thread surely isn't good as the first picture. The direction have high and low points: in some points is interesting, but in some points is silly. Sometimes the director look for inspiration in the pictures of Alfred Hitchcock movies, but unfortunately don't work."
961,"Great thriller. Wonderful twists and turns in the movie keep you interested. A few jump scares and creepy scenes to make it a good horror movie. Much like the original movie Hollow man, it follows along the same path of suspense and utter fear. I really enjoyed the thrill and anticipation of what will happen with the main lead woman."
962,"Does nothing interesting, little or no suspense, characters have no depth and plot is so full of holes"
963,"After only 25 minutes, it became boring. Cringe conversations, the pointless use of music in scenes. The film is at least half an hour too long. After 30 minutes I started praying for something to start happening. In vain. The 7.5 rating is overblown and unjustified, I would say even artificially raised. Although the acting of the main actress should be praised. The film is too stretched, if it had lasted half an hour shorter, it would have been better. The idea was good, the realization could have been much better. Basically, it's by no means 7.5. 4 maximum."
964,"The film is good enough for you to watch till the end. It becomes a bit predictable towards the end, although for some people might find that the suspense is still there. He directing is normal and camera movements are normal. It lacks ""that thing"" in order for me to give it an 8."
965,"This film relies on the character being invisible plus being able to pull off action that have a very low possibility of succeeding. The other characters have to be almost marionettes with no resistance at all. I give it a 5 or 6 because I'd never watch it again, but I wasn't bored, just unimpressed at the end."
966,"After Get Out, people assumed Blumhouse had the Midas Touch. They couldn't have been more wrong. Truth be told, as bad as Us. was, Jordan Peele better pray his next movie hits, because Twilight Zone was the worst TV series of 2019This trend continues with Invisible Man. This titles was cursed since Universal decided to reboot it. The Dark Universe was a solid concept, but the casting was terrible. The same applies here. Elizabeth Moss grossly misscast and this movie lacks any serious star power. The script is weak, plot is terrible and execution is poor.There is nothing entertaining or redeeming about this movie and you will be left feeling as emtpy as the main character is invisible."
967,Doesn't it just annoy you so much when they use deleted scenes to advertise a movie in the trailer but not in the movie itself? I felt cheated somewhat. This movie is absolute garbage really but I'm giving it a 5/10 because I felt like it had some genuine potential to be good had the actors played it with some more emotion and the storyline been a lot more gripping. It's basically just ok but if I were you I'd spend an hour and a half of my life doing something more productive like.. washing my hair?
968,Would I recommend it to a friend? I don't think so. Did I regret watching it? Not really. Not the best thriller out there but not the worst either. Could be a choice if you are bored to death and about to lose your will to live.
969,"After watching this film, I was not only annoyed at wasting 2 hours of my life but I was utterly perplexed at why it had such great reviews! According to some of these 80+ point reviews on Metacritic I was going to see the ""terrors of domestic violence through the lens of a classic horror movie monster"". Where exactly did they see these bits? I was expecting a film full of tension and nervousness which, to be fair, the opening scene has, hence my generous 4 out of 10. But from then on, what I saw was Ofred from the handmaid's tale Vs a rubbish Predator topped off with a Scream-esque twist that was as pointless as it was daft. There's no real exploration of what Ofred (can't even remember her character's name from the movie) went through with this guy, we learn nothing about what he did besides one drab scene where she says ""he controlled everything"". We know nothing about why he's so loaded apart from he's a ""world leader"" in optics, whatever that is. In fact, as a bad guy goes, he's pretty much a nonentity. Maybe that's what they were going for with this film? He is invisible after all I suppose. The scares are not that scary. The guy's invisible so immediately you assume he's followed Ofred to her mate's house and is in the room with her all the time. Everything that follows is entirely predictable. In the bedroom scene my wife even called ""and here we have the bed sheet being pulled off"" 5 seconds before it happened. Ofred does stupid things throughout the movie, like taking a knife out of a plastic bag to get a good set of incriminating prints on there, well done Ofred, and not thinking to say ""check the CCTV"" which would clearly show things appearing to move around by themselves. Anyway, that's enough about the actual film. It's boring and about 40 minutes too long.
What I'm really struggling to understand is why such good reviews? And why is everyone raving on about Elizabeth Moss? I just don't get it!! She's not a terrible actor but she is playing the exact same character here as she does in Handmaid's Tale, even down to the stupid faces she pulls, ranging from she's just smelled something really bad to she might be having a small stroke! I feel like I am existing in an alternate reality where the rules of what makes a good film/character have suddenly changed and I haven't been told. Do critics nowadays just decide what films they're going to give a good review to based on their own preferences as opposed to the actual content of the film? It certainly feels that way. Us is another fine example, compared to this tripe Us was actually an OK movie but 93% critic score on rotten tomatoes?? What film did they watch? These critics really need to sharpen up their game because they are at real risk of becoming utterly redundant!
If you really want to watch a good film about the horrors of domestic violence that actually is full of gut wrenching tension then I recommend Once Were Warriors, although in today's climate it would probably be panned for being ""too violent"" ironically."
970,"Hollow Man was much scarier and went much deeper into what an invisible man would do.In this movie, the ""bad"" guy just invented a tech that would make him a multibillionaire, that would change the world (maybe for worse), and everything he does is trolling his ex-girlfriend. Okay, I guess...By the way, did I mention this tech also gave him superhuman strength and martial art knowledge ?Of course, there are CCTV when needed and none when this would ruin the plot.The movie lacks a scene showing how abusive and scary the boyfriend was.The more I think about this movie, the more I hate it. Don't bother watching it"
971,"This didn¬¥t do it for me as i found it very predictable.
It also had some plotholes and just stupid actions taken that, it feels like, sole purpose was to make the movie go on."
972,"First of all I don't know where the 8-10 star reviews are coming from. This was a very hard watch from the beginning starting with the bad acting right through to the gaping plot holes and inconsistencies.
There seemed to be no chemistry between any of the characters and no depth or back story either. We're supposed to believe that this multi-millionaire tech genius has come up with this intricate yet flawed plot to come back from the grave in order to keep the very average and boring Cecilia under his control. This just makes no sense. There is then the ridiculous idea of an invisibility suit being created without any government/military officials catching wind of it, especially after the creator allegedly kills himself and leaves all of this technology and equipment in his house. Why didn't any one check and find these invisibility suits which appear to be just lying around when Cecilia comes to investigate Adrian the genius' house (along with a dog that no one seems to have bothered into taking care of). These are just a couple of the plot inconsistencies here and I could write pages full of them but I will not waste my time. All in all I did stick it out until the end hoping for some sort of twist or turn that could save this film but there were none."
973,"I really liked how Cecilia's struggles are portrayed through the acting of Elisabeth Moss. She's a great actress. And as for the movie, this is a breath of fresh air in modern filmmaking is all I'm gonna say. It's original and has a great and intense plot.Also that cut throat scene in the restaurant jumped me off of my seat. Top stuff. I highly recommend this movie."
974,"Another semi-plot hole I didn't see mentioned in other reviews. When she finds Adrian's phone she now has the photos on his phone as proof because who else could have taken them? If I was her I would have immediately emailed them from his phone.The ending bugged me. She went from victim to psycho killer. We're supposed to feel justified because Adrian is a creep but instead it just felt like she'll be the next crazy person with the suit. Now maybe that was the point. There will be a sequel, the Invisible Woman, where Cecilia uses the suit to do bad things. For whatever reason though the fact that she could brutally murder Adrian removed my sympathy for her. James saw the suit, I can't imagine knowing what it could do he'd let her leave with it. Nor as a cop do I believe he'd be okay with Cecilia committing murder.I think a more interesting ending could have been her using the suit in other ways against Adrian but that's not the movie we were given.I would also have expected the existence of the suit itself to cause more of a sensation. As others mentioned it's hard to believe Adrian wouldn't have noticed the other suit is missing. Further it's hard to imagine they wouldn't have all been confiscated by the authorities one way or another. Sure they don't believe it was Adrian but the witnesses at the hospital / institution and James', the cop's experience, seem like it would have been enough to confiscate everything in Adrian's lab"
975,"Good Remake and new Approach to the famous Story. The film starts very slow and does not exaggerate with ignoring scientific Facts like the Kevin Bacon Version did for example. This feels like an intiminate and intimidating Stalking Thriller more than a SciFi Horror film.
Elisabeth Moss is absolutely dareing in the leading role as a Woman who more and more loses faith in her own mental conditions. This was a great way to tell the Story. It also has many Scenes that bring you to the Edge of your seat, and I am Talking About very subtle scares resulting from atmosphere and camera ankles rather than for the genre typical jump scares. It Kind of has the same mood as ""The Haunting of Hill House"" had mixed with some really well constructed Action Scenes that often come in as a surprise. Also the Twists were good, Always when you think you figured it out, it turns around.
Really a good modern Horror Thriller that makes you wish for more of this Kind. Elizabeth Moss is really having a good year Career wise, showing off some really great Performances, and this is no exception."
976,"If I have one big problem with this kind of movie, it is how technology becomes completely interchangeable with magic. But, sure, let's for a moment suspend all our disbelief and just say that ""a wizard did it"" and look at what is left: a horrible contrived plot with as many holes as are there analogies about things with holes in them. A sieve? A swiss cheese? Anyway, it doesn't really matter. Everything is predictable, you see the jump scares coming from a mile away. The ""inception sound"" effect is played roughly every 30 seconds. And finally, I suppose that the suit also granted the wearer super strength, but how does that explain how the evil wizard was able to punch through the window of the car in the beginning when he wasn't wearing it? But again, who cares. 2/10."
977,"Well, only if you have a genius-psychotic-abusive-clingy-billionaire-boyfriend then you probably will get paranoid. The movie serves a pretty great thrill, the whole invisibility concept is nothing new, yet combined with a well executed spooky vibe it succeeds in keeping my interest throughout."
978,"You watch the movie, you take a deep breath and say ""Wow, there was hard work in it."" Then you take another breath and the oxygen flows through your brain and you start questioning what you have just watched. There was no palpable plot. We have absolutely no clue that the guy was abusing the girl but her words. And the guy gets killed in the ending for nothing. You pity on that girl, everyone thinks she's crazy, but then you find out she really is. And you can talk about the characters like they're no one, because there's no character development. I didn't feel attached even very little to characters. You don't feel what they feel, you don't understand what their purposes are doing something. Yes, it's thrilling to see (actually not see) there's an invisible man there moving unpredictably trying to kill people and the sound effects are to good that they give you the feeling he is there, but everything happened in the movie becomes meaningless when you see the ending. It's like watching few short movies combined in one whole movie. Characters change their attitude so fast with no reason, they sometimes act like they don't have the ability to think, which means the writers thought we're stupid enough to overlook what does not make sense, which is one of the few things a writer should absolutely not do.I'm not going to go over every illogical scene but few things are prepossesing me. Like we see the weather forecast on the TV and we think it's something important. I personally waited for the girl to watch the ground to see where raindrops are not falling so she could find the invisible man but no, it's just nothing. It was just there to make their conversation dramatic (!). It wouldn't be a problem if it was just raining, like you may want the scene to look cinematic but if you show us something on purpose, like ""Hey, look at this, this will become important!"" we wait to see what it will affect. It's just the ""rifle hanging on the wall"" thing.And same goes for the card lawyer pulled out of his bag which said ""Don't draw on the table, use the paper."" I thought it was a message for Cesilia first, then I believed it was Adrian controlling his brother, but in the end I can't decide what it actually is. The final scene asked so many new questions and didn't answer any of them. It pretends to answer with a few ""clever"" lines but it actually doesn't, just confusing.So you can watch it, you can have fun but it's definitely not the best thriller of the year."
979,"This movie has gotten a lot of hate from people most reviews either complain that it doesn't follow the original novel or the 1993 movie it's supposed to be a remake of the other complaint is that it has several plot holes and I can see why so many people would have these opinions of this movie and honestly I half agree and half disagree with them.I completely agree that this shouldn't have been marketed or named as a remake of The Invisible Man as the movie doesn't follow the source material very well at best it's a loose adaptation of it and it should have been marketed as a psychological thriller not a horror thriller the story would have actually worked better as it's own universe instead of being part of an existing one.The movie does have some plot holes and continuity errors mainly to do with the technology involved in making the suit that allows a person to be completely invisible and how such technology could be invented without heavy surveillance from the government and the army who wouldn't let a scientist create something so groundbreaking and important without constant knowledge of what they doing how they are doing it and heavy involvement in the project not to mention the the constant monitoring and observation that would be put in place just to protect it it's highly unlikely that they would allow a scientist to build this suit at home with no outside interferences and it's even more unlikely that they would allow someone who abuses his wife his family and everyone around him and is very psychologically unstable build such a device.All that being said I actually enjoyed the movie for two reasons number one I didn't expect this movie to be made as an actual reboot mainly because of interview's that came out before the movie was released that talked about the plot and the ideas behind it and if your a movie buff you will surely expect Hollywood to mess up anything that's meant to be a reboot by making it nothing like the original and just slap an old profitable name on something new to get people to watch it.The second reason I enjoyed this movie is because while it's not the movie I wanted (An actual Invisible Man reboot) it still tried to be a serious movie and tried it's best to be inventive and rediscover something old with some new ideas thrown into it while nothing ground breaking the movie is still enjoyable and interesting which is more than most modern movies can manage.I personally enjoyed the first half of the movie the most as it really seemed like it was going in the right direction and had the potential for it to be a serious psychological thriller that focused on what wasn't being seen or heard rather than what is much like older movies that used suspenceful music and background camera shots that made you look for something that the characters are missing.Unfortunately the second part of the movie is where most of the problems lie as the movie jumps from a suspenceful, quiet and atmospheric psychological thriller to a dramatic action thriller along the same lines as the movie Hollowman (2000) and focuses on action and violence that completely shifts the tone and feel of the movie and takes away the suspence build up in the first half of the movie into a series of unnecessary action scenes that involve running around and shooting guns shouting and screaming a disappointing end to a movie with a very promising start.The acting from lead actress Elizabeth Moss is truly amazing especially considering she had to pretend to talk and have physical altercations with a pretend invisible person and convey fear of something she cannot see hear or even experience in real life that's something difficult to do and even if your opinion on this movie is negative she should be appreciated for her talent and perseverance.The camerawork and cinematography is amazing throughout the movie especially in the first half you can see that the director tried to create suspence with atmospheric scenes and a clever use of quietness in key moments.Overall while this movie does have it's flaws and doesn't deliver on it's promise as a remake of a classic movie character it is still worth watching and it is very enjoyable even if it's not the movie you were expecting try and put the reviews aside and enjoy it for what it is two hours of entertainment that is more entertaining than most of the stuff available on streaming services and TV."
980,It has nothing to do with horror and a little weak
981,"If you're looking for an updated version of The Invisible Man using the latest in special effects technology, this ain't it. In fact, this could've been easily made in the 1930s. Not that it's a bad thing, but the title suggests a re-make of the classic film of the same name but with updated special effects.In reality, this film was more a re-make of the 90s film, Sleeping with the Enemy, than the 30s film, The Invisible Man. Obviously, the first mistake of this film was its title. It was less about an invisible man and more about a woman trying to get away from her controlling husband. It's a good film but not the great Invisible Man re-make I was expecting.Another problem was that it started out slow. It took a good half and hour before anything happened. Shaving 20 minutes off this film would've improved it.Overall this film was suspenseful and entertaining but it really wasn't about an invisible man. It's a good thing it was released online because it's not worth seeing in theaters. For a better Invisible Man re-make, watch Paul Verhoeven's Hollow Man. Very enjoyable and totally underrated. It's 20 years old but its special effects can hold its own today."
982,"Sloppily written script saved by cinematography and good acting (altho I am starting to feel Elizabeth Moss keeps playing the same character in every movie/series she participates in). Enfin, movie had too many plot holes that left me uneasy and annoyed. Good entertainment, but nothing to take seriously."
983,"Nothing in this movie surprised me. It seemed to take forever to get going and I found it very formulaic. I was able to predict what was going to happen with very little effort.The standard questions and problems apply here... how is it that every scientist who is a little on the warped side seems to be a fantastic fighter and in great physical shape in these films? Have writers ever spent any time near anyone in just about any scientific field? They aren't exactly gym rats or martial arts adepts, they spend all their time working on their projects. Think Big Bang Theory instead of Bruce Lee. But here we have a mad genius who is also a great fighter as well as an expert in psychological manipulation. Amazing how he found time to create his fantastic suit!Was ANYONE surprised when she opened her portfolio only to find it empty? No? Didn't think so.The sister's fate is so obvious that Stevie Wonder could see it coming, and once again we have someone in a movie falling dead as soon as the knife cuts across her throat. In reality, there would be so much arterial spray that people on neighbouring tables would have it all over themselves, and she would take minutes to bleed out, not die instantly as if she was shot in the head.Was anyone surprised part 2: Cecilia is PREGNANT! The only surprise was that it took so long to get the news out. There needed to be a reason to keep Adrian from simply killing her to get revenge, that would have made for a much shorter and most likely more enjoyable film, and his wanting to be a father at any cost was the key to that. No matter that he was incredibly rich, lived in a fantastic home, was very good-looking and could probably have had his choice of women at the snap of his fingers, he wanted the one who did not want him. Even though from the beginning she seemed to be as stable as a bowl of Jello in an earthquake. Go figure.Then there is Cecilia's ineptitude. During the major escape/attack scene in the facility, 'Adrian' is about 30 feet away from her in a suit that is flipping on and off, and she is maybe a foot away from a guard's gun but just lies there yelling and only grabs the gun after he has shot one more guard and taken two others out and is running away. I will not even mention the incompetence of the guards. When she does finally catch up to him, like usual the bad guy takes three or four in the chest and keeps coming. Hasn't anyone in these movies ever watched one of these movies? Usually the bad guy is wearing body armour. Go for a head shot, especially when you have a stationary target or the bad guy hits the ground. But no, lets just take chest shot after shot while the guy keeps coming. I felt like screaming at the screen HEAD SHOT!!!!! And then came 'was anyone surprised part 3': the big reveal when the mask came off, which was a surprise to no one still awake.The ending was problematic as well when it comes to timing. How did she get in the suit, cut his throat, run back, get out of the suit and then walk back in time to see him die? Suddenly Cecilia has become a quick change artist. We also need to consider that she never really had any time to learn how the suit actually worked. And learning how to walk and move in a suit where she herself likely could not see her own limbs would have taken some practice. I don't know, maybe it is the suit itself that turns scientists and lawyers into killers with Jason Bourne like skills and also makes the wearer instantly know how the suit works, if the wearer can figure how to even turn it on.But hey! At least Adrian took a more realistic length of time to die from his slit throat. The only realistic thing in the movie. And Cecilia really pulled herself together from a total wreck to turn into a calm, cold-blooded killer in a few days or weeks. Incredible.So to summarize, the movie seemed to take forever to get going, was very predictable, and seemed to never want to end. But she walked away with the suit, so I guess we will have a sequel coming along eventually. Oh joy! LOL!"
984,"....I wanted the movie to end very differently, sadly the movie was predictable and I was hoping to be wrong. If they could have done something from the classics like ""Fight Club"" or any other movie with a twist ending or an ending that keeps you guessing, I would have gave this movie a 10. Other wise this was a good movie, kept me intrigued for sure."
985,"Pros:
Cool tension
Cool plot ideas
Good two main characters, villain is uniquely threatening and it's easy to sympathize with our heroineCons:
Some out of character moments
Have to suspend your disbelief to go along with some of the invisible shenanigans, yet at the same time didn't go far enough with the ideaBest part: beginning scene, best form of tension in the whole film
Worst part: the mean email being a conflict, no one would believe it, it's silly it was taken so seriously"
986,"This film had the potential to be a very good one as everything about it was good except its pace which was very slow resulting it in being quite cumbersome to watch at times especially in the second half.
An edge of the seat thriller should not be so slow that it causes the motion picture to drag which happened in this case.
This reduced the quality of the movie to above average.
6/10"
987,I'm not sure if I just expected more before going to watch this film. I guess it kept you pretty entertained throughout but I didn't come away from the film completely satisfied.
988,"The idea of invisibility has been explored countless times. Still, it can render a movie interesting. This work, however, did not entirely exploit it, and it certainly could have been better. In addition, the movie is flawed with plot holes and loose ends. But the ending is somewhat satisfying and leaves you with a sense of character admiration."
989,"The casting of the lead actress seems to be one of the main problems. She simply doesn't look the part to me. Doesn't come across as a likely billionaire's wife and her actions are constantly too stupid. The motivation of the main villain is not convincing.A movie about the apparently teleporting dog that was in this storyline would have been more interesting.One of the worst movies of the year for sure.Constant tell not show. The faking of the main villain's death we literally see in a newspaper clipping. Ridiculous.Movies such as Hollow Man and Terminator have done all this sort of stuff we are presented with before and far better. Can't believe the director of this tripe is getting a crack at bringing Snake Plissken back. He should be removed from Hollywood after making this garbage, with force if necessary."
990,"This is a vigorous, rigorous and actually fresh take on a concept that goes back to the beginning of sound in film. I'm sure there are certain things to pick apart logically or a convenience or two to note in where things like surveillance cameras are (or aren't) at points, but these are things that would only get my goad if the main story and purpose wasn't strong.Right out the gate and to that last impactful shot, Leigh Whannel follows up the promise of his surprisingly fun Upgrade in writing and directing this such with an intricate, efficient and exacting eye for the negative space - whether Cecilia sees Adrian or not - but this also ratchets up the tension and suspense. It's long, methodical takes, yet they are always in service of the psychology of the scenes.He takes his time as a writer to set up beat by beat how much this monster is screwing with her, and while 'Gaslighting' is never uttered we know what the score is. Moss sells every second of this, but the writing needed to be there for it to work as far as making clear what kind of constricting world of psychopathy is going on (both with Adrian and as we find out and this isn't a spoiler to say leaving out details but his brother too), and why it would be believable that no one believes what she's saying. But what makes The Invisible Man such a thrill is seeing the potential being realized in the premise - moreover, the filmmaking follows this villain in all of his violent degrees.For me, this bests the original 1933 Invisible Man by a mile (frankly the only thing I remember about that standing out wad Claude Rains's performance, though it's been a while), not to mention something like Hollow Man. More to the point, this is the kind of remarkable genre cinema that attempts to stand head to head with one kind of sequence - a gruesome, murderous spree in a mental hospital - that we all think/thought topped out with the escape sequence in Terminator 2, and for moment-to-moment intensity, by the tracking of the camera and the brutality that unfolds, it is that good.Throw in some impressive visual effects, twists that actually make an impact and a central character who aside from investing in out of pure empathy is a proverbial Good character because she doesn't do the dumb horror movie things, and you got a crackling, hard edged, sincere blast of modern cinema. Thanks, Blum! I can start forgiving you for Fantasy Island (am I all the way there yet? Lets see how The Hunt pans out..."
991,"Corny. Campy. Had lots of potential. So dum it doesn't deserve the ""b"". Don't waste your time"
992,"Bad acting, bad directing - much too cheap both!
Bad acting, bad directing - much too cheap both!"
993,"On HBO- you'd have to pay me to watch it. Watch the original 1933 Claude Raineswho liked the beginning?after she flees- the conversations & scenes are SO BORING. i gave up about 1/3 in.I am only so so on Moss. it's the script. Can't direct garbage, so I can't say how much is the director. can't comment on the casting or acting bec story line, dialogue & scenes are so bad."
994,"I was excited to see this movie from the start but it Wowed me more than expected!! First of all the acting was top notch, no corny lines or crappy acting at all. I really loved Aldis Hodge the most. He brought a certain vibe to the movie that made me glad he was in it. The story felt very fresh to me. It was so well done I was surprised the budget was only 7 million. I am so glad I watched this movie. It was really outstanding! Had me at the edge of my seat the whole time!!"
995,"If you wanna watch a good Horror movie, watch this one is incredible how good this movie is. And for me it's almost as good as It Chapter 2..."
996,"I was very disappointed.Having read The Invisible Man book by H. G. Wells as a child, and having seen the 1930s movie version with Claude Rains, I was expecting something far better.But the acting was poor, and there were inconsistencies in the story."
997,How this got a 7+ rating is mind-boggling. As someone who loved Hollowman (starring Kevin Bacon) I was hoping for something at least on par...I couldn't even watch all of The Invisible Man because it's really that bad. Trash.
998,"Problem with IMDB rating today is, that all movies should go 2 points down, at least! Some even more. Parasite should go 5 points down, but we need to be politiaclly correct. By saying this movie is 7, I'm trying not to insult it or director and keep it within the IMDB curve, since rating system is ruined by the people who don't understand the point of rating something on the scale from 1-10.Movies today lack the substance to be rated on such a large scale and imdb should change rating sistem to 1-5. To rate something on 1-10 you need much more elements and movies today simply do not offer that depth anymore.This movie should be 5 or 6 on IMDB scale, Parasite should be 3, Inception should be 10, Terminator should be 5 and so on. We ruined rating system by allowing idiots to comment."
999,"If your expecting an action filled,special effect laden thriller go watch Hollowman.If you want to watch a boring,slow disappointment with a practically Invisable appearance of the title character,this your movie."
1000,"Pass on this one its not even a rental, Kate Moss couldn't look any worse, no man is going to mind losing this old hag, too far fetched even for a somewhat sci/fi flick."
1001,"Changing my rating to 9 as I have just figured out the ending. Very very smart from the director. Thumbs up. Not going to share this unfortunately (well at least not for a while) as I can see why the director has done it the way he has. Brilliant.Original (morning) review below:Brilliant film from start to just 10 minutes before the end. I don't want to spoil it. I didn't like the end but understand some people did?? üòÇ, hence why I have given it 7/10 instead of 9/10. The direction and cinematography was very similar to the Upgrade film, so a thumbs up. Please continue to make these type of films. Love them."
1002,"The lead actress and the cinematography were about the only things good in what should have been a movie about psychological nightmare and paranoia, a thriller that makes you think aswell as chills you, but opts for the schlocky spoon fed thrills and spills angle. The whole fact the villain does what he does just because she left him is absurd, giving that he's supposed to be a tech genius, there's also a scene where the lead finds a phone that can prove she's telling the truth, but decided not to take it, there's so many scenes full of these ridiculous resolves, especially the ending, what did everyone else watch."
1003,"I know I'm not a big-time producer/screenwriter/director, so the below commentary amounts to a hill of beans. But the narrative avenues the H.G. Wells premise of a man becoming invisible offers so much more story scenerios--both funny and dramatic--that I see this film as a frustrating exercise for this viewer.Leigh Whannell went the horror/thriller route, which reflects a dark side that shows how Hollywood elites thins of Americans today--corrupt, abusive and devious to the extreme. His plot celebrates women power, but lost in all the scary scenarios is a humanist approach to the positiveness of the human species. IM was all a ""Debby Downer,"" a cynical outlook on today's capitalistic society gorging the vulnerable.I'm generously giving this a five star on Elizabeth Moss' heart-tugging performance and Stefan Duscio's snappy cinematography. But otherwise, IM will be largely forgotten in the trash heap of mediocre horror films."
1004,Only people who pass for some toxic relationship knows the feeling that Elizabeth Moss felt.
1005,"I was on edge most of the film, I even gasped out loud more than once. Great storyline and I was still thinking about it the next day"
1006,"Clearly written by a cinephile, and a very clever, relevant, twist in the classic story."
1007,"The Invisible Man is another movie that is based of the acclaimed novel by H.G. Wells. Fun Fact: this was originally going to be the second movie in the cinematic universe ""Dark Universe"" with Johnny Depp playing the titled character. However, the flop of the Mummy seems to have made Universal focus on standalone Universal monster movies. This new strategy seems to be the right move as The Invisible Man is an absolute thrill of a movie. The general summary of this movie is that Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) who has escaped an abusive relationship from her ex Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) only for weeks later to find out he committed suicide. However, she suspects his death was a hoax and that she is being hunted by someone nobody can see.The biggest praise of this movie has got to be Elisabeth Moss performance.She gives an authentic performance of a character who has been in an abusive relationship.She makes the emotional stakes feel high and her agony feel genuine. However, she is also able to give a ferocity in her performance when her character decides to fight. She does an incredible job in carrying this movie. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch is also incredibly unsettling and intense when it needs to be. It manages to perfectly elevate the scene in every way and really make the audience invested what they are watching. I also have to praise their unique use of camera shots. The director Leigh Whannell uses a lot of wide shots and panning to make it really feel like there is someone else in the room watching our character Cecilia. The story is also really engaging and is a really smart narrative on woman who have been abused or manipulated. The movie has great scares and great suspenseful moments that are not just relying on jump scares(but there are some) and it is just a breath of fresh air for a horror movie.This isn't the director's fault but the trailers kind of ruin a fair amount of the surprise sadly. I highly recommend people don't watch the trailer for this movie cause it will lessen the experience. My biggest issue with this movie is just the amount of plot holes that really make me question things. I will avoid spoiler territory. The first thing I have to question is the lack of cameras? There are security cameras in this world and this movie emphasises cameras but when there is a scene that 100% would have security cameras in the real world, the movie decides it doesn't exist anymore. Also I have to question how a certain character is able to get to get from point a to point b so quick when there is clearly no transportation used by this character. Additionally, this character somehow knows where everyone is just baffling and unexplained. You have to suspend some of your belief to accept these and unfortunately that is kinda difficult especially considering the tech shown in this movie. The last act of this movie also feels really contrasting to the the slower and suspenseful pace of the first two acts of this movie and it kinda makes it feel like a completely different movie. Honestly, I also prefer the first two acts compared to the last one.Overall, this movie is just a great horror movie and a fresh contemporary adaptation of the novel. If you want a unique and vastly different horror movie experience then this movie is a must watch for you."
1008,"Elisabeth Moss takes you through directions you thought you'd never take! The connection between the sisters and the abuser is incredible. This was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. Elisabeth Moss really caught my attention when she was in the movie, ""US"". This movie made me a huge fan! The theme, sounds, and twist was amazing."
1009,"Went into this with high expectations and I was not disappointed. Always on the edge of my seat. Very unpredictable unlike so many horrors these days. Absolutely loved it. Acting from Moss was incredible. Music was also splendid. Story telling was so good, not rushed. Just such a brilliant movie."
1010,"This Movie tops it as I'm still recovering from THE RISE OF SKYWALKER. It tells a story of a woman Cecilia who escapes from her abusive Boyfriend. She learns he commits suicide or Did He? She inherited a huge amount of money from her deceased boyfriend Adrian. But after that Strange things happen. This is a real shocker even though I didn't watch the original 1933 classic. I only watched parts of it. Based on the novel of the same name By H.G Wells. This is a real top notch thriller and I enjoyed it. Great Performances By the cast Especially Elisabeth Moss, whom you feel great sympathy as she struggles to fight this invisible ghost that Stalks her and tries to keep her sanity.
Great cinematography. The music is great with a little Herrmann here and there. The movie gets you so much involved but no more spoilers here. This is a great movie so far since 2020 began. It won't disappoint you. My overall rating: 7.8."
1011,"Probably a really great movie knocked down suggest a good movie thanks to once again a ridiculously over long trailer reading far too much from later events in the film. Even with all the spoilers in the trailer you still get a few surprises and unexpected twists. Plus writer/director Leigh Whannell, shows as with his previous film Upgrade, that he can bring a fresh new approach to well used stories. But the key element here has to be Elizabeth Moss, who puts in a great performance as the traumatized girlfriend trying to escape years of domestic abuse. It's a shame with such a good actor that film did not go with a more subtle and ambiguous approach, to keep audiences guessing. A bit overlong for a jump scare shocker, but thankfully never reliant on too much dumbness."
1012,"TRIGGER WARNING: To those who suffer from anxiety and/or have a history of depression, this can be a rather difficult movie to sit through.

The inability to see your enemy deeply unsettles as a cast of complex characters deal with what can only be called the scariest use of new technology to incite fear, bringing forth the psychological terror that is the anxieties of an abusive relationship.

1013,"I liked the movie a lot. At the beginning it is a thriller of suspense that catches you from the beginning: Gender violence, psychological abuse, drama, tension and manipulation by a gifted psychopath. The film is raised by the magnificent performance of Elisabeth Moss. In the middle it falls and becomes the typical Friday the 13th or Halloween horror movie. But that last turn when they are having dinner for me is great. In the end I am left with the doubt of whether it was him or not, maybe he was telling the truth but she was never going to be able to live with that uncertainty and with the hell he made her go through."
1014,"This is one of those movies that is simply better to experience in a theater. Be sure to catch it while you can!The Invisible Man is interesting, suspenseful, well-written, fast-paced, brutal at times, and has a few twists and turns that leave you thinking about deeper concepts related to abusive relationships and misogyny. But the best part of this film, HANDS DOWN, is Elisabeth Moss's performance. She was a very visible force!"
1015,"This movie was excellent, it's very rare that I watch any good horror movies these days, but my word this was absolutely brilliant! From the beginning to the end, it keeps you guessing and wondering what's going to happen next all the way through."
1016,Dont bother with the negative critics. Go to the cinema and see for yourself .... A great movie that brings Joy to everyone ..... Must see movie
1017,"One of the best movies I have seen in a long time
From the beginning to the end none stop action and suspense"
1018,"The movie had a slow start, but got interesting in the middle. it keeps you on the edge of your seat till the actual reveal.. Then they decided to push the character arch and my god, it flopped. Lets just say, they had a good stopping point and they just threw it in the bin with the last 20 minutes or so. Do yourself a favo and watch something else. This movie will be on tv soon or free to watch easily. its really one of those movie where you just turn on and leave it running in the background like the first movie."
1019,"9 of 10 written reviews are below 5, yet this has a ""7.1""???And I watched the movie... can't comprehend how this is in the 7's.Something's fishy."
1020,"Another film with this idea: men are bad, women are good. And men always try to destroy women's lives. Come on!!! Don't watch it. it's just awful , and full of anti-men ideology."
1021,"Did people actually pay to watch this piee of s**t? Poetic licence is one thing, ripping people off is an entirely different kettle of fish. I saw paint dry in the first 10 minutes, I didn't bother with the other 114. A complete waste of time."
1022,"From the first scene to the last, there's a sense of redundancy that moves the film slowly along. You have an awesome invention that is used merely to torment an ex-wife. You could rob a bank or check out the shower at a college dorm. Nope, gonna wear my invisibility suit to make my extra look nuts. I didn't like it. There was one cool scene where the ex is talking to her sister and the invisible man cuts the sister's throat and puts the knife in his ex's hand. She looked like she killed her sister in a crowded restaurant. Then, she does this same thing to him at the end of the movie. Hollow Man was ten times the movie that this was."
1023,THIS MOVIE WAS TRASH. I HAVE SEEN BETTER MOVIES ON LIFETIME..
1024,The film has a nice atmosphere but it's not as thrilling as it could have been. Story can be a bit cliche and the ending is not satisfying. Good performance by Elizabeth Moss though.
1025,"When I first saw the teaser for this movie before Doctor Sleep I had some high expectations that it was gonna be good. And since it's from Blumhouse, the indie horror company that has made great horror movies like Us and Get Out, you know it's gonna be scary good. Unlike other versions of this classic story, this one is rated R and has more gore and language than the original movie. It's also updated for the 21st century, complete with security cameras and smartphones and cloaking technology. Go see this in in Imax as the sound is good and the picture is well done."
1026,"This movie seems to be getting mostly really good reviews or really bad ones, and I don't see why people are giving it 1/10 stars. This is a great movie with great actors, many twists and a lot of suspense. Definitely worth your money. The only thing I would say is that after the first scene, the next 10ish minutes are pretty slow and boring, but it gets very exciting afterward and I love this movie."
1027,"Best thriller of the year. Great directing, great acting, great story, great Everything. It's a must watch"
1028,I will not explain much but tell that this is really great movie to start 2020 of great movies. If you liked Leigh's work in Upgrade then this is even better. I totally recommend this movie who likes on the edge of your seat kind of movies.
1029,Why this film is so good?Is it because of the intense scary moment or powerful performances or terrifying screenplay? What if I said all three comes in a package!!!
1030,I wish hemorrhoids on anybody that thought this was a good movie!
1031,One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Awful senario
1032,"More than the screenplay, it's the direction, treatment, superb camerawork and credibly underlined performance from Elizabeth MossThis movie is very tense, edgy, and heart pumping when you realize thee is such a thing to make an invisible person!! and very enjoyable."
1033,"This movie in particular, after watching many of this genre, I can assure you that this one is completely different from all the horror movies I've ever seen, and I say that in a very good way.Lately, some films and series of these days are trying to put, in a forced and at the same time very annoying way, plots that support the cause of political correctness, falling as a consequence, big companies that lost the respect of the real moviegoers. And I don't say ""big"" because of how good their movies are, on the contrary, by ""big"" I mean the large amount of money they make from making films like that, which, to be honest, are a complete mess.Themes such as feminism, cultural diversity and political ideas are often the reasons why cinema industry is falling into a bottomless pit until it can never get out of it. And don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying that these themes are bad, on the contrary, they are themes that should be very interesting to implement in a work of fiction, and I say ""should"" because, until now, I haven't seen any film or series that respects its script by wanting to implement these ideologies in it, which is more than regrettable... but that has just changed right now.The Invisible Man, written and directed by Leigh Whannell, wants to give a deep meaning to one of the themes mentioned above, and it does.The film is about Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss), a woman who lives with Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), a mad scientist who made her life impossible. One day Cecilia escapes from his expensive house, and weeks later she feels an evil presence in her home, something or someone she cannot see, but who can hurt her. Cecilia soon will discover that this presence is more than familiar to her.The Invisible Man is hooking from start to finish, having a more than satisfactory ending, adding excellent performances, well-achieved scares, crazy direction, great photography, and a chilling soundtrack, making this film a complete masterpiece.And remember when I mentioned that this film is very different from other horror movies I've ever seen? Well, I didn't lie to you.What I liked the most about this film is the fact that the theme of feminism is very, very well implemented in the story, without comparing it to certain films that I don't even want to remember existed. Women in this film are not put as semi-goddesses who can deal with everything, on the contrary, at the beginning you see the protagonist with fear of the evil Griffin, escaping from him, suffering, so that in the end, she gets her well-deserved revenge, giving us a great ending, and at the same time, a great film."
1034,"I enjoyed the movie so much, scary/nervous from beginning til end. Definitely best movie this year so far.It's sci-fi thriller not horror movie, so perfect for me."
1035,"This film explores the idea of domestic abusive in a very different way to anything I've ever seen. It is very brutal on how he makes her feel. For everyone (even her friends and family) turn on her for what he has done just is scary. There was multiple twists in the movie where none of them felt forced. The character development of Adrian is like no other. Even though he isn't on screen much, you learn so much about him. Fear is built from the unknown, which is done brilliantly. Must watch."
1036,"Ok, now I saw the Creepy Man before. But this Film looks Totally Awesome. I think this will be my next Film to go to Watch. The review looks really good. That Girl looks really Scared and Creeded out. When she was saying goodbye to her Dog. Then that Alarm went off then she was on the streets in that car with that young girl. Then that window smashed open. Then they show he died but still WANTING HER. Now that is really creeping how he is still after her. Plus she can't see him. This is a Scary Film."
1037,"To be honest I don't really like Elisabeth Moss as an actor, but this movie she surprised me and played the role to a perfect T. Loved the story and the ending. Well done (insert thumbs up)"
1038,"'The Invisible Man' is a fantastic modern take on a classic story written by H.G. Wells which was originally adapted to film in 1933. Cecilia (Elizabeth Moss) escapes from her abusive boyfriend, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), who then takes his own life, but she suspects his death was a hoax.
Leigh Whannell is the director and writer of the modern take. He does a great job at putting the audience in Cecilia's position. The cinematography (Stefan Duscio and Daniel Grant) is brilliant due to an interesting camera trick where they linger on empty space to build the anxiety inside the viewers mind which mirrors the main protagonist.
All the acting is perfect, in particular Elizabeth Moss who unsurprisingly is able to do a fantastic job when acting next to nobody in scenes with the invisible man. Aldis Hodge (James Lanier) and Storm Reid (Sydney Lanier) are great foils for Moss and all of them seem to be having genuine fun when in scenes together.
The writing is thrilling with most of the twists genuinely coming from out of nowhere. Whannel pays homage to the original story in certain scenes whilst also grounding this picture in reality with the source of the vanishing being a suit of technology as oppose to the older explanation of chemicals falling on him.
However, the weaker parts weren't as apparent and are mainly nitpicks. My big nitpick is that for some reason, there are no security cameras in any public areas which is really obvious in certain scenes.
Overall, this is a very enjoyable thriller that expertly builds suspense. I can't wait for more modern retellings of old stories by 'Blumhouse Productions'."
1039,"I watched this luckily using a streaming service so after one hour of watching stupid events I hit the fast forward. The ending? Well after hurrying to the end I couldn't even be bothered with that.The point I lost all hope was in the first hour, the IM gets a bucket of paint or milk, well some white liquid poured over him. After four steps nothing was drooping off of him, HOW. Was the suit self cleaning or could dry liquid. A bit later the sink has some of the mixture in it, so the IM is the best self cleanser that ever existed. So so stupid."
1040,"Let's face it, brilliant horror films are few and far between. But this is one of them. Edge of your seat, pretty much all the way through. I've rated it nine out of ten purely because what are you going to give the best film ever made, if you hand out tens to one's that are just really great üòâ"
1041,I came without any expectation but I was really surprised. Great film!
1042,"Never wrote a review, but this movie is ed wood esque. There are so many holes even for a make believe movie and sadly the invisible suit isn't one of them. I' m completely flabbergasted by how terrible this movie is... don't not waste the 2 hours and 5 minutes of your life. This movie is on part with Gummo."
1043,"With the latest state of the art tools and toys to produce nightmarish representative reality on screen filmmakers have become lazy and unimaginative. Capable of all sorts of magic tricks they give scant attention fleshing out character or filling obvious plot holes in favor of getting you to dive under your seat with the blood and gore money shots that CGI is superb at creating. Enter The Invisible Man, a generic high gloss slasher, twice as long as an episode of Thriller and a lot less of it in it.Director Leigh Whannel seems more than content to bore (not to be confused with build suspense) in between his butchery that has Elizabeth Moss trying to avoid a dead ex with a brilliant imagination. Larding up scenes with Moss trying to convince folks she is being stalked by a dead invisible guy leads you to worrying more about her hygiene than her predicament.The abracadabra moments of horror do jolt with authority but overall merely act as smelling salts to Whannel's sluggish pacing in-between. The Invisible Man is not worth looking at."
1044,"This was the last movie I saw In theaters before the Coronavirus shutdown. Elizabeth Moss will be the next scream Queen, she was absolutely brilliant in this movie. She's an amazing actress. This movie was so good. Yes, there were plot holes but overall this movie was extremely well done. There are two scenes I had no idea what was going to happen. Attic scene & Dinner scene! That's what I call a great horror movie. Tbh 7.1 for this movie is extremely low."
1045,"A married woman tries to escape her abusive husband who takes revenge via the use of an invisibility suit he has developed without her knowledge.Sounds good right? and for the first hour or so this is a decent thriller....made so by the nature of the scenario alone. However, how difficult is it to create suspense when the audience knows there is a potential perperator who can't be seen?What this movie lacks is giving the audience the opportunity to assess how they would deal with an invisible attacker. I spent half the film internally screaming ""throw some flour at him!""I wont go into the plot holes as they'll give too much away, but the main problem with the movie is 2/3rds of the way through when it switches genre from thriller to comicbook like sci fi. From that moment the film loses all credibility and becomes a predictable mess.Elisabeth Moss is cast well as her facial reactions suit the subtle suspense in the early parts of the film, but the other charecters could be played by mannequins and you wouldn't know the difference.If you watch this filming hoping for cleverly cinematic invisibility scenarios I would urge you not to bother and as just a thriller it is not worth the time."
1046,"A good start for a mystery movie, i kinda like it in the beginningand after an hour its become weird...and my question isis adrian the bad guy or not
its not really clear whos the bad guy"
1047,"Elizabeth Moss can do no wrong. I've always said it, and in this interpretation of 'The Invisible Man' she manages to hold her own against a script that loses itself and becomes more of a yawn than frightening. Perhaps Hollywood has forgotten how to make a movie scary. Perhaps writers don't know what scary is. Either way, this film begins entertainingly suspenseful but it quickly loses its steam. For instance, when we know the Invisible Man is in the room with her, we expect bad things to happen. In today's world, an audience needs to be surprised and caught off guard - something this film fails to do. Perhaps 'The Invisible Man' has been played out. It's been done, done again, and now overdone. I would enjoy seeing originality return to Hollywood, but I have a feeling in a few more years, we'll have another rehashing of this film, which I've nicknamed 'Sleepy Time Tea.' If you're craving an 'Invisible Man' story, watch the original. If you're craving something stellar featuring Elizabeth Moss, look elsewhere."
1048,For its genre it's a superb movie. The psychopathic nature of the villain is what made this movie good. Unexpected ending. 10/10 for a horror movie
1049,"So I really wanted to love this movie and think it had a ton of potential!! The problem is if you pay attention to detail at all during the movie you can find endless things that were missed when editing and just made no sense... no blood when there should be blood, no bruises when there should be bruises, miraculously bruises show up the next scene....The list goes on and on I can't believe someone didn't catch these things and thought it was OK to release the movie as is..... A lot of talents and great work in my opinion was just wasted on some major oversights and plot holes... just my opinion."
1050,"It started out with Elizabeth Moss as the main actress of the film. Johnny Depp was written out of the film. Elizabeth Moss is marred to an abusive husband. She leaves him and she is unaware he has technology to make him invisible to people eyes. Throughout the film she was made to look crazy the reason why it got so many stars. In the end she survives from his bloodthirsty killings he made himself look captured once SWAT team arrives. Play his hand as the person who took him hostage and pretend to be another person. Elizabeth Moss tries to set him up with a wire. She later leaves the dining room and he takes a knife and cut his throat, very sickening, So Moss and the friend decides to make it look Suicide after she called 911 omigod he's injured. When he arrives she tells him no. So he accepts that he committed Suicide and waits for the authorities to arrive. The End. Universal Picture monster movie series is going down this is the only one that got more than 5 stars."
1051,"Just stupid.
Plot holes.
Special effects, eh.
Summary - stupid
Don't waste your time."
1052,"A swing and a miss. I read a few reviews before undertaking a viewing & basically was told to ignore the reviews! I don't know what the script was trying to accomplish, but it did start out somewhat interesting enough with a bit of romance brewing between Cecilia Kass (Moss) & Adrian Gibson (Moss), who is a nerdy science-guy. Then, the story and the Gibson character peel off on unexpected (and unwelcome) tangents, and the movie sinks into a murky abyss. Leigh Whannell is the Director & Scriptwriter-so, I guess the blame should fall on his shoulders.The makeup work was good, and the acting was fine. There just wasn't a serviceable script to work from. This is the sort of example that guys who teach film-making school use to show what NOT to do with a story."
1053,As a horror film it doesn't hit the mark at all but it's still a film worthy of a watch and I will watch again as I feel I missed some things. Great acting and cinematography and visual affects üëçüèª
1054,"The stage curtains open ...This version of ""The Invisible Man"" is not glamorized, is not over-the-top, and doesn't have some wild, convoluted plot to support it. It is a remarkable approach to an old idea, with a modern flair and characters of substance. I have to admit, this movie took me by surprise ... in a good way.Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) takes control of her life back one night, by leaving her abusive boyfriend behind, barely escaping his clutches. She hides out with a police detective friend and his daughter until the news comes around that her boyfriend had committed suicide. However, she is still wary and suspects that he may still be alive, when things begin to happen around her that has no logical explanation or resolution. The suspense builds, and clues are found that leads her to an inevitable final confrontation with her invisible stalker with deadly results.The last ""invisible man"" movie I watched prior to this one, was ""Hollow Man"" with Kevin Bacon, and by its own right, was a fun piece of film-making as well. However, this newest entry, was the opposite of that one. We don't know who is really stalking her until the end, though we have our suspicions. The chills we experience are subtle and genuine. The movie doesn't rely on extravagant special effects to elicit its scares. It builds slowly and lets the paranoia settle into you as well as her. It is very clever and engaging. And Elisabeth Moss completely sells herself as the tormented victim.I highly recommend this movie. I was completely pulled in from the opening scene and it never let me go. This is a fine movie with solid performances, and a very good ending. I certainly hope there are more of these on the horizon, and if there are, I will be among the first in line to watch it. A solid 8 stars out of 10."
1055,"Pros:Very good opening sceneGood performance from Elisabeth MossUnique story/narrative - I like the concept of the 'Invisible' man being the villianA few very good scenes - high thrill aspect - The dinner SceneCons:Ending was a little predictable for meWould've liked more from some of the supporting castOverall, I thought 'The Invisible Man' was a unique thriller that contained some very well shot scenes. I did keep me guessing as the runtime went along. As I mentioned, I thought Elisabeth Moss gave a condemnable performance here, shows here versatility as an actress. Some scenes in particular were very intense and increased the films pace and I loved that. I did, however, think the ending was a little disappointing and predictable, but overall, a good solid watchQuote - ""He said that wherever I went, he would find me, walk right up to me, and I wouldn't be able to see him"" - CeciliaScore - 3.5/5"
1056,"Elisabeth Moss, PLEASE keep making more stuff, I loved seeing her in this movie.
Her acting was amazing, off the chart, you can literally feel her feelings throughout the entire movie.
I also felt that more movies should use the ""camera movement"" kind of thing for horror movies, for example; when the Invisible man wasn't shown on the screen, before he was painted or his suit was damaged, the camera kept shooting to add cinematic effect of ""where is the man, did this knife just moved?""
or for example Cecilia was looking at a place and she knew he was there.
Elisabeth, keep making great stuff and your acting is amazing."
1057,"I really enjoyed this film, very suspenseful and jumpy in parts. The film kept me on the edge of my seat.. would highly recommend"
1058,Thick with a suspenseful & interesting story until the end. Backed by a cool musical score & a convincing leading lady.
1059,"This is a really good movie. It was a horror movie within a horror movie. A story of an abused woman trying to escape her abusive ex, but it brings in a classic universal monster at the same time. Elizabeth Moss' performance is so captivating, I'd be shocked if the academy ignores it come nomination time. I really hope this isn't another Toni Collett in Hereditary situation. I'd also really love for this to get a screenplay nomination, it brought The Invisible Man into modern day, and made it original (thank you Dead Meat Podcast for that quote). The score was solid as well, classical yet electronic and scary. Some of the shots reminded me of Paranormal Activity (burning pan similar to ouija board, and pulling off the covers). Also, sound Adrian made sounds kind of like the Predator from Predator. Finally, two twists in the movie, and neither were expected! Overall great movie."
1060,"I'm not sure how The Invisible Man did it, but it had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. You could nitpick some thing here and there if you really wanted to (there are some logic issues throughout just like most every horror movie), but it gets so much right that there's no sense in worrying about the few things it doesn't get right. One thing I couldn't find a single fault in was the performance by Elizabeth Moss. It's one of the greatest performances I've ever seen in a horror film and the audience is with her every step of the way."
1061,I liked it. Grab some popcorn or whatever you like and enjoy the movie. Those who say it was predictable should buy stock and then tell us how rich they got. Idiots.
1062,"First of all, an invisible suit and a horror movie just don't fit together.
And why would a top scientist spend so much time controlling his girlfriend? It doesn't make sense to me."
1063,"This was God-awful. Terrible acting, totally predictable storyline, and way too long. I want my $4.99 back from Netflix.
I saw spot-on recreations of parts of ""The Terminator,"" ""Hollow Man,"" ""Sleeping With The Enemy,"" and more. That's the only reason I gave it a 3; it was funny to suddenly be confronted with the memory of Sarah Connor in a completely different movie.
If you really want a suspense movie, go somewhere else. If you want a wanna-be scary with occasional laughable moments, wait till it's free, then give this POS a watch."
1064,"They obviously tried to gain from her fame from the shows. This whole movie is just her and close up monologues. Every single ""scary scene"" is complete garbage. It just looks bad, they had the money but holy moly did they mess it up, every time something moves it looks like ropes are doing it not an invisible person!! She just did the dumbest things any person could and would do the whole flippn movie, b movie collage kids from a horror movie would be like "" oh don't do that your dumb""! And tones of other stuff. Did I mention the long horrible monologues yet? This movie was slow and boring! They should have just stuck with him doing invisible pranks, then at least it would have been worth somthing. Garbage!!!"
1065,I fast forwarded through most of the movie. The acting is atrocious and i like Moss and Dorman. The whole story was just ridiculous and the effects had me laughing. I don't get the hype but different strokes for different folks.
1066,"The concept is obviously there but there was too many plot holes that I couldn't get out of my mind while I was watching the movie. I would like to point out two things. Firstly, how did her spouse follow her back to their house so quickly. Is he like the Flash? Secondly, how did pepper spray penetrate the suit? Is there like breathing holes? Seems rather hilarious. Nonetheless, it's a HUGE coincidence she aimed directly on his FACE. Maybe, they could've explained the anatomy of the suit more because it plays such a huge role. Overall, it was interesting and decent. I didn't expect too much from the trailer."
1067,"I watched this movie for bit of popcorn fun, what I got unexpectedly thrilling psychological horror. Recommend for sure, don't pay attention to the trailer, it sells a completely different movie."
1068,This is the first and maybe my only ever review I will write. On what level are people entertained by this movie? Let alone give it a 7.1. The main character is now flush with cash but is apparently oblivious to thermal optics. The whole premise is utterly stupid. You are now completely invisible. So let's play ghost pranks on your ex wife?? Simple stunning.
1069,It's a good movie to watch with family. We liked the fighter Cecilia. Good actress.
1070,"This is one of the wittiest plots I've seen in a long time. Fist class acting, editing and definitely writing. Loved every minute!"
1071,"Over rated movie nothing Uniqe concepts.
If you watch this it's doesn't worth it. Over acting."
1072,The movie revolves around a Elisabeth Moss and her boyfriend who is obsessed with her to the core. One fine day she escapes and what happens next is expect the unexpected. Profound show by Elisabeth Moss as usual ! Solid writing & Screenplay at its best !Must See !
1073,"Was there something political about this movie that I missed, because you'd think so given the extremely polarizing reviews? I'm actually serious. Was there something on Fox News (Biggest victim complex on the planet) whining about this movie? I genuinely don't understand how anyone that watched it could think it was terrible. It was a good movie. Creepy, edge of your seat thriller."
1074,"Wow the main character was boring. She was unappealing in every sense due to her not being able to connect with the viewer at any point. So many holes in the plot, won't bother spoiling your future dissapointment if you go ahead and watch it. Oh & let's not forget Bad Man, abuser man, controlling man, victim woman, hero woman, revenge superpower woman, well done Holywood for allowing another one through....not! It could have been so much more with some more depth from the main character & some ironing out of the flaws in script"
1075,"Awful acting, pans away so special effects not needed, back shots and you can tell he's hunched down so can't see back of his head, in a word AWFUL.
Avoid at all costs to save wasting 90minutes of your life."
1076,"You know that a story is weak when you can feel that every little aspect of it had to happen *exactly* the way it happened to be the way the director envisioned, even if it means disregarding common sense. Multiple times.
And in this case there's a bonus: this movie is so full with cliches that you can easily predict the next piece of the domino coming and, eventually, falling down, until there's nothing else to expect or to wish for, and you're left with the not-so invisible feeling of regret.
Steer clear: there's literally *nothing* to see here"
1077,This could have been and should have been good but sadly it wasn't. The plot holes were endless but the one that niggled me the most and does not appear to be mentioned by other reviewers was the wrist slashing. How come not one droplet of blood was seen? Most bizarre! The entire movie was very disappointing to say the least. Read the other reviews for the many plot hole mistakes. There's no need for me to repeat them.
1078,"Wasn't blown away by it.. All feels really bland. Slow pace, pretty flat thru-out and nothing I'd want to watch again.. Just feels like a slot filler. A that'll do kind of movie. The CGI is weak but that's to be expected as the movie feels half hearted. Cast are ok but no stand out performance, its hard to believe someone capable of creating an invisible suit would then find joy in opening and closing doors, switching lights on an off and just mess with an ex rather than actually do epic things with or get recognition for.. I'm sure it'll appeal to many but for me it was a bore. It tried to be smart but its very straight forward. The ending is pretty predictable. Just my opinion tho, a very forgettable film. Considering how long the movie has been on and off in production, you'd think they'd have added some flare or scare to the film but it's just long winded and at times, silly! Each to their own. Maybe if they'd got better cast it would have stood out abit more but as it is, it's very flat.."
1079,"This movie was definitely thrilling, but could have been better. The story and the intentions behind the ""invisible man"" was not clear, and the basic question is - how could the suicide of the villain has been disguised easily, that is not clearly explained, rather just fooling the police department. Well, the acting of Elizabeth was applaudable."
1080,"I don't know what movie these other viewers saw but I truly enjoyed this. Maybe a bit too much was shown in the trailer but got surprised positively several times during the film, and I'm very grateful for that, this didn't happen for some time now!
I would recommend this show!"
1081,"Movies is excellent, one or two flaws, but overall there impression is great as well as the atmosphere. The only negative comment is regarding the very title of the movie. It just reveals to much, it imposes in what direction the audience should think. The mystery would be greater with less obvious title."
1082,I was waiting something good but it was just a trash movie with some no scary scenes and just running it's bad don't watch it
1083,"It was a good movie but I wished the ending was not so predectible, I think the movie should have taken a turn revealing her to be mentally ill and that she really killed her sister not Adrian"
1084,I liked the storyline.... what i didn't like was the lead actress. She kind of blew the whole movie for me. Her looks didn't fit the role and she was very over the top in many scenes. Also plot holes and lots of moments where you want to shake your head.
1085,"The movie has a good concept and some good scenes but it isn't near enough to make up for the bad performance of some actors. The first part of the movie is painful to watch but manageable as the curiosity of finding how the man became invisible keeps you interested. Eventually a couple scenes happens which actually makes you think that second part of the movie will make up for the rest, but nope. Bad dialogue, poorly shot scenes, annoying main character, awful ending.. so many things that didnt make sense... no idea why this movie has this decent score."
1086,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Invisible Man"" (2020) was a very good horror thriller. While its nearly impossible to discuss this movies plot without getting into spoilers, i will only say that i enjoyed its first three quarters more then the last one, but still it was a very good movie overall. This movies premise only confirmed the old truth - most scary things are ones we can't see, when then our imagination starts to filling the unseen parts, and its always works.Overall, ""The Invisible Man"" is a very skillful directed, written and acted movie. It is spooky, keeps you guessing and does this in a good way."
1087,"I wasn't attracted to the tile in the first place. And I was unfortunately right.. this is a movie that you can effortlessly see what exactly is coming. And if you could think of more than one possible ways, choose the most lazy and lame one... BANG you got the right track.
More over, the director arranged the characters to behave more than often like they've got no judgement or even common sense, just because it's easier to fit in the plot.
NOT recommended unless you're watching it with your easily scared girl/boy friend who'd hug you tight every time the movie screams for some obvious reason.*****SPOILER ALERT****
OMG as I'm writing this review the movie just bumped into the lamest part where Emily was slit dead in a PUBLIC RESTAURANT which most likely would have CCTV! officially dropping its rating from 6 to 4. Thanks guys.****another twist****
Sorry I just wasted another 20 mins of my life on this ""movie"" and I have to come back and drop the rating to 3... seems like this hole has no bottom after all."
1088,"This is a great movie. You can enjoy this movie with your family. For those who thinks this a horror movie or not for them IT IS NOT.
I would give it 9/10 but once you finish watching this movie, you will know that it is that kind of movie that you can watch only once. Other than that it is a great movie."
1089,"The Invisible Man (2020)
8.5/10üî™‚úí""Leigh Whannell channels his inner Hitchcock in his reimagining of an iconic character by creating a horror/thriller that is sure to keep you on your toes.""2020 has had it's share of multiple horror misfires, however The Invisible Man brings the genre back to the top. With Director Leigh Whannell, famously known for his involvement in the Saw Franchise, he is able to put a spin on the classic tale of the madman turning himself invisible to wreak havoc on the world. In this case, the ""world"" comes in the form of one woman, played beautifully by the wonderful Elisabeth Moss, who is the wife of an abusive technological genius. We then come to realize that he committed suicide and she believes her nightmare is over. What goes from the great escape ends up turning into a deadly game of cat and mouse. The way the film portrays this is by using the silent technique to keep viewers on alert that anything can happen at this point, with no music involved either, as well as the paranoid portrayal that Moss delivers, allowing us to understand the mental torture she endures. Story wise, the film tends to be a bit jumpy here and there but it does well enough to keep itself on track to help explain the reasoning of the situation that occurs. Coming from Leigh Whannell, we are expected to find violent sequences, which are not overblown here like in his previous film, Upgrade, but rather strategically placed for effectiveness purposes. My biggest criticism here is that the film does play it safe a little too much. With a premise like this, it should be fair to expect and assume that anything can happen to pretty much anyone, but upon it's final act, the film tends to fall into a small pit of predictability.Verdict: The Invisible Man is all the what a solid movie that proves the worthiness of Leigh Whannell as well as the acting chops from Elisabeth Moss. As far as it going down as a classic is debatable, but it will most certainly rank amongst the best horror movies of 2020."
1090,"I was skeptical at first and first looked at reviews from who first saw it because I thought its bad but then I discovered that Leigh Whannell directed this movie (which directed Saw, Dead Silence, Insidious & Insidious 2) and with Jason Blum (Blumhouse Productions) producing this movie and I was wrong! This movie is different from the 1933 one and the book by H.G Wells and instead focuses on modern technology (which I think some bookreaders hate this movie) but that's a brilliant idea, on how they change it since we are on the modern age now. It also stars Elizabeth Moss which is the standout for this film, his acting and emotions is superb and Leigh Whannell's directing, which is one of my favorite horror movie directors also rocked this movie with how he shot the movie making the audience feel like someone is watching them (making them feeling like Elizabeth Moss' character) at where the camera faces. Overall, don't wait for Blu-ray or DVD but watch this psychological thriller in theatres/cinemas, you'll love this and the plot twist (which I'd rather not say because it'll ruin the experience) will also make you shook. 7-stars for this movie and looking forward to Leigh Whannell's movies that he'll direct!"
1091,"""The Invisible Man"" opens on a secluded waterfront mansion. Inside of it, Cecilia Kass is executing her plan to run away from her abusive boyfriend, Adrian. She successfully escapes, but not without Adrian running after her in a violent fury.A few weeks after her departure, Cecilia is notified that Adrian has committed suicide. Her relief of his demise doesn't last long as a series of coincidences begin to take shape. Cecilia starts to hear noises and has the constant feeling she is being watched. After some time, she discovers that Adrian isn't dead, but invisible. He's gaslighting her into submission, playing vicious tricks around the house and tormenting others connected to her. With no one believing her situation, Cecilia must work to defend herself and the people she loves from unseen harm.As the writer/director behind several horror franchises such as ""Saw"" and ""Insidious,"" Leigh Whannell once again proves his chops here.He commands the material with his expert use of the camera and lighting. A multitude of slow pans and still shots imbue each scene with a lingering sense of terror that never ceases to grab hold of you. The dark, shadowy lighting puts a magnifying glass on Cecilia's isolation as she battles her internal and external demons.And because the assailant cannot be seen, Whannell also relies on some expert sound design that is similar to the style used in ""A Quiet Place."" Silence is the most abundant and effective sound device as it fills the gaps between the creaks and rumbles. It becomes clear throughout that hearing nothing is much scarier than hearing something.But what Whannell can be respected for most is his refusal to stoop to jump scares, especially considering the story allows for that. Sure, a jump scare here or there would have jolted some energy into the often overly-slow pacing, but Whannell's insistence on taking the high road makes for a more complete horror experience.Of course, the concept of someone turning themself invisible is a little silly. The movie doesn't totally defend against that criticism either, only mustering a quick line about how Adrian was ""a leader in the field of optics."" However, once you get past that barrier of disbelief, you'll open yourself up to what this movie has to offer under the hood.The script for ""The Invisible Man,"" penned by Whannell himself, has more on its mind than just scares. The movie does a great job of conveying the torment and aftermath that an abusive relationship can have on someone. Cecilia, as a character, is given a full arc as we follow her journey of slow recovery from beginning to end. This added layer brings a deeper meaning that is both used to educate about a serious topic and make the horror material pack a bigger punch.Portraying our heroine is the commanding Elisabeth Moss. It's another unhinged performance similar to her previous roles in ""Her Smell"" and ""The Handmaid's Tale."" Moss's all-in attitude helps suspend our disbelief of the material and grounds her character in the real-world. She's utterly believable in even the most bewildering of situations and carries the emotional weight of the film.Commendable supporting performances come from both Aldis Hodge as a sympathetic detective and Michael Dorman as Adrian's brother, Tom.Through inventive storytelling and craftsmanship, Leigh Whannell and Elisabeth Moss have quite possibly created the definitive version for this ludicrous premise. Released in a time of year infamous for forgettable horror movies, it's a breath of fresh air to see quality original content have its time to shine."
1092,"I saw that the movie has very nice reviews and a good IMDB rating but I didn't expect it to be so good. I enjoyed it very much. The beginning is a little bit slow but the second part of the movie is awesome. Worth watching, for sure.And yes, the music is FANTASTIC in the movie!"
1093,"Missed opportunity. bad movie. the original remains superior, much better could be done here, for sure."
1094,"Pros...Great visuals, photography,engaging....cons...same old revenge story"
1095,"Starts good, slowly builds up an atmosphere, takes care of the details, tells about the psychological side of an invisible menace: great! Well filmed, great sound, great colors. It's all Whannell.Then, halfway through, it turns into a B-movie you probabily watched 30 years ago. Boring, predictable, full of holes. Whannell seems bored by the second part of his own movie, like he doesn't care for it anymore."
1096,"Yes, this is a good idea and we have plot twists. Is she crazy? Is he dead? Is there an invisible dude? Is the invisible dude his brother and he's a victim? Those are not bad in fact. But needed some better construction to back them up. This movie really lacks in that regard and becomes nonsense/ilogic many times. And this is a single character movie, only the main character really exists, all others wouldn't make any difference existing or not. Their presentations, existence and impact are negligible."
1097,"There are many people on here trying to bring down the overall score with 1 star reviews, instead of giving an honest review of their experience with the movie. This ignorant and blatant weaponization of audience scores is childish and detracts from the reality of the film. It has fantastic acting, writing, and it is packed to the brim with tension that will have you on the edge of your seat. It is a fantastic thriller that is not as politically motivated as many would like to have potential viewers believe. There are very few movies that deserve a 1 star rating out there and I can assure everyone that this one does not deserve the hate that it is given."
1098,"Credit to the fact that it was a compelling movie to see to the end, but the topic and delivery are pretty generic. It's just another psycho thriller.What's more worrying is that a man who can be technically so successful and being such an incredible home want to own a woman in such a way. Why would someone want to be with a woman by keeping her prisoner? That is the most insane part of all. 1% home woman by imprisoning her. One 'owns' her by keeping her free. That is what Mena 4. To keep her free."
1099,"I had a bit of skepticism in me before watching this and was only convinced by outer forces (my sisters). I thought it was gonna be another bleak, ""everything is on the trailer"" type of movie that's overrated. Obviously I was wrong. It turned out to be very satisfying. Storyline was well perceived by the audience and movie goers which indicates that it was written solidly. Unlike most of the thrillers that came out recently that rely on jumpscares and mediocre writing, The Invisible Man's atmosphere is controlled and it dictates the whole movie. Some scenes ought to get your heart racing and some would want to make you clench your fist so hard due to the lead role's desperation. The camera work was also spot on, panning was one of the best and really gets that suspense out of you and into the crowd. Overall, great movie, great cast, huge clap at the end!"
1100,"Great edge of your seat,wow! Omg ,movie that makes you wonder what's coming next,sucked you right in and you never know what's going to happen...I dont who these other viewers are but this was a good one for an invisible man.
Great Job!"
1101,"The first hour and a half had great tension and clever camera work.The movie lost all of that tension and lost my interest completely in the hallway of the mental hospital, when the main character had close to 60 seconds to grab the gun lying right next to her and put five slugs in the villain's back while he was beating up a dozen guards.Instead, she kindly waits until he's done slowly murdering everyone before finally picking up the gun and ultimately letting him escape. The movie would have been great if she had ended it right there. Instead it goes on for another half hour, cramming in completely unnecessary plot twists one after another.In the end she kills him in the most predictable way possible and the villain, who is supposed to be a genius and who has been ahead of her every step of the way during the movie, just sits there and lets it happen. I don't know what else to say. It feels like the second half of the movie was written by a different and less intelligent person."
1102,Was OK I guess but had a stupid ending. Very cheaply made; a lot of the film filmed at night time so a lot of the action happens in bad lighting. Don't waste your time.
1103,"Starts out great, The acting was good, cinematography was good, but the characters were unrealistically stupid it left me angry. Hard pass."
1104,"When a person is in a bad situation, It also gets worse over time. This is called adaptability.
So I liked this movie, was good"
1105,"Its average. Not sure where the 7/10 came from. Started with high hopes but became a tad boring. Watched it, couple of frights, nothing major. Story line could have been improved.Preferred the Kevin Bacon movie to this."
1106,"I'm not a fan of scary movies but this movie isn't all jump scares like your typical scary movies. It's an interesting story that keeps you wondering what or who the ""invisible man"" is while throwing in some plot twists."
1107,"I've watched many iterations of the Invisible Man theme since the late 50s. They're all, by nature of the theme, intriguing. This one is unique in how it expands on the idea of pathological domestic abuse being exploited by the invisible character. It's also probably the best filmed version -- the cinematography is superb and always mood building. Most scenes are a rooms, so how could it be 'shot so well'? Ah, the Kubrick effect -- slow steady pondering views that suggest you should be seeing something in that space, but... And, of course, Kate Moss, was perfect in this role.My only complaint, which was minor, was that the antagonist had little to no back story about either his abusiveness or his science background that allowed him to develop the special technology. It (the background story) was so buried and obscure that when it was revealed in pieces along the way it was about a relative stranger that the audience had no investment in.Nevertheless, thumbs up for The Invisible Man, 2020."
1108,"I've always wanted to see a thriller, but this one, you can't really see it because it is
the invisible man ! The thrill, the excitement and yes, the great acting of Elizabeth Moss !
Somehow it reminded me of ""Sleeping with the enemy"" but this one is much better. Much, much better !
I won't go into particulars because I wanted you to experience not knowing or in this case, not seeing the excitement and the fear of the final scene. Enjoy your quarantine time !"
1109,"I've lost count on ""Invisible Man"" movies I've seen including the 2 ""Hollow Man"" movies. And on top of that the TV series from the 70's with David McCallum.This was very entertaining remake that included aspects of the previous movie plots of Hollow Man, and Invisible Man themes, and it worked very well. Especially considering you rarely even see the villain!Elizabeth Moss did a wonderful job in her role as the spouse and makes every facet of her character seem relatable and believable. Kudos to her, as she's the reason for my 8.Well worth watching, and I assure you the 2 hours will be very well spent!"
1110,"After The Mummy miscarriage, I was afraid The Invisible Man would be another train wreck. How pleasantly surprised I was! I didn't expect such a smart and edgy film. Please revive the other Universal monsters with the same inspiration!"
1111,"Have seen better and I have seen worse! I liked the story and I liked all the actors, and I never got bored, but two hours is a bit too long! I don't get the bad reviews, because it's a good psychological thriller!"
1112,"Reinvented and brought in to the 21st Century, l thoroughly enjoyed it with enough jumps and tension and great Sound affects, a great modern interpretation with invisible man being the antagonist and harassing his ex wife in complete disguise, gripping and intense a film to make the original Universal Horror movies proud"
1113,"This is a horror film that is not afraid of spoilers. Even if you know what happened, excellent lens language and actor performance can still make you creepy. I only watched the first 2 minutes like sitting on a needle felt, and began to regret: Why should I watch this horror movie where girls are victims?
It's scary and scary, and after watching it, I feel really worth the trip.
The thrilling sensation runs through from the first minute of thunderous shooting to the last minute of the heroine's smiling opening ending."
1114,"We'll at least they weren't A list actors. Made this all the more greater. The women weren't even pretty and yet the quality of the plot was splendid. Had all the elements of sci fi, horror, thriller and action to make a quality watch. I guarantee this will become a cult classic at the very least."
1115,"Solid film overall. Great acting, story, and characters.Takes a little while to actually get started. They easily could have cut about 20 minutes to improve pacing and tighten the story up. The last hour is where it shines and everything that was set up really starts paying off.Lacking any kind of dark/organic humor. It's very dreary and downright boring at times. Films like Upgrade and Hollow Man managed to have a sort of charm about them that this film is sorely lacking.The thriller elements were engaging and clever. They really utilize the invisible man concept to its full potential. You feel like the protagonist is truly in danger at any given moment and the action doesn't devolve into people just being picked up and thrown into walls.Despite some shaky logic at times, this is a worthy and serious entry in the lineup of films based on The Invisible Man."
1116,"Coming into this movie without any hopes and understanding what might come was the best thing to do because it was the best surprise that you might expect at the beginning of the year.Leigh Whannell presents us with a great knowledge about what anticipation, empty space, paranoid behavior and amazing leading actor can to to magnify effects of something that we expect to levels of unexpected. From designs to cinematography to smart story it just keeps on giving gifts and it will suck you like the same way you eat popcorn when things get tense keeping you wanting more and questioning every single thing.Elizabeth Moss is just perfect, there isn't a single thing that you might point out in her brilliant performance. From being freaked out to being frustrated to extraordinary bad things that keep on happening to her she just presents it all brilliantly.After some time movie might affect you the same way she is affected because of brilliant camera work and presentation of things that are there but aren't and it is freaking mad and enjoyable.Terror and tension are going through roof at some points and it will be chaotic, bloody, terrifying everything one horror lover wants to see and experience.Classic story told through eyes of Leigh and his touch of science was great if you come over some slight issues that present themselves along the way, but considering how movie is made and what it is about you will forget about them and that is what is all about focusing on what this movie does best and that is making you scared of empty space. 3.5/4"
1117,This film is very dark and throughout and rambles . Odd bits of action I was constantly waiting for it to start. May trigger people who are in an abusive relationship such as this.
1118,"One of those films that forces you to stay off of your phone. If you take an eye off the screen, you might miss something. This movie had me on the edge of my seat from the first scene until the very end. I just wish they would of expanded on how her husband was so abusive. Also, what was Cecilia's connection to the father and daughter? Maybe I missed something. There was definitely some plot holes, but that doesn't justify a rating under 5 stars. The only scene I didn't like was when Adrian (the invisible Man) hits the little girl. Cecilia was clearly 3 to 4 feet away and still gets blammed, lol that was ridiculous. The next few minutes make up for it, gets pretty intense right after that. For the most part this was a fun watch. I don't get all the terrible reviews. It's definitely an entertaining thriller I'd recommend watching. 8 stars."
1119,"It's a good film that is very predictable but the performances make up for the predictability. It's extremely obvious how the story will unfold but I think this film is more about the journey. Also, with the ending it gave me a feeling of sort of a superhero origin story."
1120,"I throughly enjoyed this movie. The plot was solid, the score added a nice tone to the movie, the pace of the movie was perfect, and the acting was convincing.I love how the camera work included wide-pan and continuous shots to make me watch even closer, making me wonder if someone was in the room or if I was crazy!Elizibeth Moss' acting was fantastic, she really added extra suspense and tension to the movie. Another mention of the musical score is warranted- it is in the same vein of the Insidious movies, and it really added to the movie in a good way!The movie was not perfect though- there are times in the movie where common sense seems lacking and I found myself saying ""why doesnt she do this?"". But these plot points do not ruin the movie.I am a big fan of Leigh Whannel and I look forward to what the future holds for him!"
1121,Decent movie when your quarinted. But if a movie buff get ready to expect the expected. Too simplistic but still something to watch when you can not find anything on.
1122,"Amazing story with amazing acting from moss , I like in most movies show how brilliant people being psychopath , nerd and controller. this movie made a perfect psychopath nerd :)"
1123,"Cecilia did a great job with the character.
Well written thiller script."
1124,It is inconsistent with many holes and stupid plot.
1125,"I'm hard to please. I like my horror thrillers to be pretty scary and horrifying! I was waiting to be scared witless by The Invisible Man and although I was'nt, I still quite enjoyed this taut little thriller. Props to all the actors in this. The only one I knew was the exceptionally talented Elizabeth Moss. The rest of the small cast were not big names, or any names tbf. However, the acting was a cut above for this type of movie. I cared what happened to these people and that's rare. The directing was tight and the story an interesting sci fi spin on the H G Wells classic story, acting good as I've said above, but the movie just did'nt scare. The tension is ramped up and then the pay off is disappointing. A man in a high tech suit is just not really scary on any level. The original story had the scientist actually making himself invisible without the use of any prop. That would have been better. In this outing, the suit can be damaged quite easily, thus the protagonist is oftened revealed at key moments, which kind of cuts the drama. It passed a couple of hours in a ho hum way but an actress of the calibre of Elizabeth Moss really needs better than this potboiler. Watchable, mildly entertaining but overall disappointing."
1126,"An engaging edge of the seat horror thriller. Loved the movie, so far best in 2020. A must watch."
1127,"Invisible Man succeeds in delivering a satisfying creepy horror that keeps you engrossed until the end and has a good twist(?) too. Elizabeth Moss is at her best game and is bound to get her Oscar nomination next year if the Academy is serious about horrors.For the large part you are able to guess the plot which is one of the few drawbacks in the film and the loopholes which should've been noticed or explained better. I wish Leigh Whannel kept the core of the plot secret until the end and changed the narrative structure of the film to stylize the film better. On its positives, the technical aspect of the film is fine, there is no use of cheap thrills and excess sound effects that we see in Final Destination and other horror franchises."
1128,Really liked it. Good suspense and thrill. Story moves along nicely. Not predictable.....
1129,"Leigh Whannell's frightening reimagining of Universal's 'The Invisible Man' provides an answer as to what's worse than a narcissistic, abusive sociopath - an invisible one.Wasting no time to engage viewers' nerves, the opening sequence smartly illustrates Cecilia's predicament with her abusive partner. The extent of her torment is conveyed through not only Elizabeth Moss's nervous performance, but through the limitations of her prison - a house overlooking the sea, bordered by high walls, and positioned in the middle of nowhere to highlight her isolation and desperation. When she finally gets away, she hopes that'll be the end of it, but her partner is the nastiest of villains who'll do anything to continue ruining her life.What follows is a deliberately paced nightmare of building up an atmosphere laden with dread. The invisible man taunts her, humiliates her, attacks her, attacks others... anything to exert full control over his victim. And it's scary because it feels believable despite the science fiction element. The camera leers around corners, teasing us with his POV; the jump scares are effective, relevant to the plot; and the violence is shocking, whether domestic or otherwise. And Elizabeth Moss brilliantly embraces the role, forcing us to imagine the level of cruelty she's already endured.Writer/director Leigh Whannell adeptly funnels us through the experience of an abused victim without succumbing to cliches. The action sequences are unusual but masterfully choreographed, and the sound design is loud and disturbing, frequently puncturing horror sequences and adding to the images on screen. Overall, 'The Invisible Man' is an excellent addition to the horror genre that is well-acted and nicely filmed.8/10"
1130,"This movie tells the heroine who managed to escape the control of the crazy scientist boyfriend's claw, but soon learned that her boyfriend had committed suicide, but soon she found that there was an ""invisible person"" around her and began to monitor her every move , Disrupting her life, and ruining her life ...The invisible human surveillance around you will even actively attack this setting of your own, although horrible,However, what makes me feel cold is that the fragile relationship between people in modern society reflected in the film is like the spider silk in the wind and rain. With a light flick, it breaks.Before the invisible man actually kills the woman around her, using only a single email full of bad words and a single blow is enough to destroy the love and trust between the hostess and sisters and friends. Stay. Moreover, they have no doubt at all, even did not insist at all even for a moment, the heroine is not such a person, the heroine cannot suddenly swear or hit someone for no reason, the mailbox may be hacked for no reason The attack did not cause them a hint of suspicion.Even if I really felt that the heroine did it, I didn't think about it at all: ""Is the gentle and cheerful heroine suddenly doing such an offensive thing for no reason? Is it because of the recent nervousness and illness? Is n't it physically uncomfortable, is it not in a good state of mind, or does it need help? ""They just immediately felt that the hostess was acting out of malicious intentions, or even if there was a little guess in her heart, it may not be the hostess's act, but rather than trusting and caring for the hostess, than trying to maintain the relationship , More willing to protect themselves, regardless of other people's affairs, so immediately turned to look at the hostess, and asked the hostess to get out of her territory.This part is too horrible but so real. It is even more frightening than having an invisible person who doesn't know what to do at any time may threaten their safety at any time."
1131,"When I first watched the trailer, I was thinking to myself ""Welp, there goes the entire movie in just 2 minutes."". But after seeing the reviews, I thought that maybe I've misjudged the trailer and the merits of this movie, so I decided to give it a chance. And I'm glad that I did. The trailer only scratches the surface of the movie and gives away nothing of major importance.The movie is filled with suspense from start to finish. There is a sense of dread that doesn't let up (well, mostly). There are some instances where the movie does devolve into a typical horror flick, but it would redeem itself quickly with another thrilling twist. I'm a huge horror movie fans but I find most Hollywood movies to rely heavily on CGI, which directors just love to shove in, front and center. They fail to realise that the scariest things about horror movies are not the images shown on screen, but what the movies make our minds conjure up. The Invisible Man got this right by taking it to the next logical step, by basically removing the ghost/demon/villain from the screen.You would find yourself holding your breath in many scenes, most of which are just empty rooms and hallways. And that's the beauty of this movie, to convey fear by basically showing nothing at all.Unlike most horror movies where the struggles of the victims are merely collateral of them trying to deal with the unexplained, this movie's villain has a singular goal, and the way events unfold will make you feel helpless, just as the main character. (I've deliberately kept this portion vague because of spoilers).All in all, it's a surprisingly good horror thriller."
1132,The Invisible Man is one of the best horror movies of recent times. It's so well made and we can't forget many scenes after watching it. It's action is almost like Leigh Channel's previous movie Upgrade which was also very good. Elisabeth Moss did an outstanding job and she proves yet again that she's one of the best actress right now. This low budget horror flick is a must watch movie for all horror fans and they have done a very good job in modernising the classic material. Waiting for more films like this from Universal's monster flicks and waiting for Leigh Whannel's next project.
1133,I think it is on the edge of a pg 13 and an r movie. The only real violent scenes were two slit throat scenes which were somewhat graphic and bloody. There wasn't a lot of language.
1134,With the same disturbing message that murder is OK.
1135,The plot of the film is not much of a surprise. But the actress's acting is very good.
1136,"Best movie ever made on narcissistic abuse. How an evil genius is obsessed with draining the life out of his partner. Using everything he has to torture and contain her. It's a psychological thriller which makes you feel the pains and suffering of a narcissist abuse victim.
A few mistakes are there but then again, nothing is perfect."
1137,"It was too predictable, but still works. I enjoyed it. The act was good, the music and effects were on point. Good thriller"
1138,"Smart, well-acted, and above all scary, The Invisible Man proves that sometimes, the classic source material for a fresh reboot can be hiding in plain sight."
1139,"While I agree with many of the reviewers who have written about the ""logic"" issues and the ""leaps of faith"" viewers are required to make when watching this film, I nevertheless enjoyed every moment of The Invisible Man. This film has all the elements a great ""monster"" movie should have. We have a heroine, played perfectly by Elizabeth Moss, who appears to be so unhinged that even her closest friends abandon her. We have the ""evil scientist"" who is determined to kill our heroine. We have plenty of suspense, generated by a great script, perfectly filmed/edited, with not too much CGI.All in all, this film has everything viewers need. Yes, it's a ""comic book"" movie. It was never intended to be ""real"" in the sense that everything MUST fit into a logically built universe. I agree that there are big gaps here and there. I actually expect that there will be at least a few of these in a film like this.I hope Universal brings back all of those great monster movies from the 30s and 40s. For me, the remakes can be in modern times or they can be retro/costume pieces. Both will work for me."
1140,"We can all agree that the Universal Monsters Cinematic Universe, the 'Dark Universe' was a disaster waiting to happen, and it did. Now we're back to what a Universe Monsters remake should be, a relatively low budget, mainly independent movie made by a director with a great idea or vision. And we definitely get that with director Leigh Whannell. This guy helped created the Saw movies, the Insidious movies, dead silence; the guy knows his horror, and with this he's proven he knows how to take an old idea and make something effective and most of all SMART with it.The movie centres on Cecilia who, after escaping from her abusive ex boyfriend, finds out a few weeks later that he's taken his own life, and has left her with several million in his will. But things soon change when Cecilia begins to realise that an invisible presence is following her. Believing her ex faked his death and is invisible, she seeks any help she can to fight back, before it's too late.Elisabeth Moss is the best part of the movie and she really holds the movie together. I bought her 100% as this character who's been left traumatised by abuse and she pulls off the right level of paranoia. All the other actors do a great job, but the only other memorable performance to me is Michael Dorman, who plays the brother of Cecilia's ex boyfriend. Dorman was great in 2009s Daybreakers, and he's great in this too. He allows his character to carry the right level of intimidation, and there is one scene he pulls that off perfectly in.This is a great way to update a universal monsters classic. Is it better than the 2004 Hollow Man with Kevin Bacon. It's definitely an update with (spoilers) an invisible tech suit being how invisibility is achieved. Personally I prefer Hollow Man, but the way they integrate the suit in the story, and especially its first reveal and the 'oh' moment is affective. There is also one jump scare in this movie that is leagues better than all the crappy ones we've gotten in DOZENS of cheap, lazy 'horror' cash grabs we've had for half a decade now. It's definitely a 'once you see it, you'll  bricks' situation. There are camera angles that make you question if the Invisible Man is there or not, or if Cecilia is acting irrational. It gets inside your head which is how a psychological thriller should do.If there's one thing I didn't like about the movie it's the ending. At first I really didn't know how to feel about it, but now I feel it could've been handled better and it left me not knowing what to think about Cecilia, our main character who we've been routing for. You could say it's sweet revenge, but it came off like the ending of a Girl with the Dragon Tattoo movie. Really could've been written better, in my opinion anyway.Overall though, I would recommend it. Better than most horror movies we've had the past 5 or 6 years, and one of the better movies Blumhouse has produced lately. I can finally forgive them for that giant pile of crap known as Black Christmas 2019. Definitely go see this if you get the chance."
1141,"This is a very mysterious movie. The success of a successful family entrepreneur, a tragedy caused by a derailment. What I see here is a person's greedy desire, not only having a cute child and a beautiful wife, but also his own business kingdom, why should he derail? Human greed comes at a price. From the beginning of Adrian's dialogue with lawyers, he continued to fabricate lies, pushed the responsibility to his lover Laura in order to maintain his status, and used the lies to constantly test whether the lawyer was worthy of his trust. Here he saw the darkness, selfishness and indifference of human nature. In the restoration of the story, we also know that in order to cover up the fact of his crime, the entrepreneur constantly used his power to erase the evidence for himself, and tried to marry others to the cold, watching the elderly with the lost child indifferently, ignoring their inner suffering. And suffering. The wife who finally knew the truth abandoned him, and the business empire that took ten years to build will also collapse. This is the dark human nature, and the annihilation of conscience will eventually come at a price."
1142,"I was very sceptical when I heard they were remaking my favourite classic horror movie. However, this movie is thankfully a different, fresh and modern take on a classic.It almost makes me wonder why they even called it 'The Invisible Man' (beyond marquee value) as it is so different to the original source material and is pretty much its own thing. I can't say too much without spoiling the film. Despite this isn't any major classic, I can safely say that this was definitely better than I expected and is a pretty good horror movie."
1143,"A very different horror movie,
Elizabeth moss's performance was incredible, her role was brilliant.Amazing cinematography. Loved the sci fi part of the movie.
But it being a horror movie, I wasn't scared, some buildup had me holding on to my seat but that was about it.
You can watch it once!"
1144,"This remake does exactly what it should do; stay true to the heart of the original yet at the same time, if necessary, alternating details to make it work as a movie. The acting is chilling, the scary moments will stay with you for a while and the effects are very convincing enough to make people believe that this insane psychopath is invisible and out for revenge. For a 7 million dollar budget, it's not bad, taking advantage of the situation and try to combine classic elements with new intelligent ones. For those who love H G Wells, you should very likely give this movie a chance."
1145,"This was a movie that when I first about it, I was intrigued with what they were going to do. I know there had been some attempts to remake some of the Universal classics and possible try to do a universe like we've seen in Marvel or DC. It is also interesting that the original movies had a bunch of sequels, which could work toward this idea if it hasn't been scrapped. The Invisible Man is one of my favorite from those original runs from then. I'm also giving it a second viewing as I needed a movie with an invisible person for an October Movie Challenge. The synopsis here is when Cecilia's (Elisabeth Moss) abusive ex takes his own life and leaves her his fortune. She suspects his death was a hoax. As a series of coincidences turn lethal, she works to prove she's being hunted by someone nobody can see.We start this with Cecilia waking up in the middle of the night. She's being extra careful as she's in bed with her boyfriend, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). We do see that she drugged him, but still doesn't want to alert him as she collects her things. There is a plan that has a lot of pieces as she flees into the night. It gets messed up when she accidentally sets off his car alarm. She makes it to the road where she waits for her sister. The tension builds until Emily Kass (Harriet Dyer) appears. Adrian breaks the window as they speed off.She stays with a friend, James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). This has been done in secret. Cecilia has not left the house since arriving which has been two weeks. She gets upset when her sister shows up. As she is scolding her stating that Adrian will use her to find Cecilia, Emily reveals that Adrian killed himself. It becomes even more of a shock when a letter arrives for her at James' place. As stated, no one really knows that she's staying there. It is from Tom Griffin (Michael Dorman). He's a lawyer and the brother of Adrian. He's tasked with managing the estate. He reveals that Adrian left her 5 million dollars to be paid out monthly for the next 4 years or so.Cecilia decides to do nice things for her hosts, including helping Sydney go to college. The problem is that weird things start to happen around Cecilia as well. She thinks someone is watching her. There's a moment where blankets seem to be moving and things happen during a job interview she cannot explain. She suspects that since Adrian was one of the foremost in optics in the world, that he faked his dead and has found a way to be invisible. Is she just breaking down thinking this or is something really happening to her?Since I laid out here my thoughts on how much I really liked the original, I thought that writer/director Leigh Whannell has some good things to play with here. What makes this scary is that the power to become invisible is really something that can corrupt. Heck, I'll be honest, I don't know if I trust myself if I had the ability to become invisible that I wouldn't do some pretty horrible things myself. This is legitimately terrifying, even more so when you have a guy like Adrian with this ability.Now I'm clearly a male so I've never been in a relationship like Cecilia. I've taken to talking to my girlfriend, Jaime, about her thoughts on this and she really liked the movie. I've also seen a horror writer online that I respect and how she said this movie brought up memories of being in a relationship similar to that. I personally found that to be the most terrifying part of this movie. I'm not saying this to spoil the movie, but I think that is the scariest thing is that no one believes her. This takes it to the extreme with things that happen in the movie, but it really is horrible that in society, we don't believe when women in relationship are not believed or a blind eye is taken to it. Seeing the fear on Cecilia was painful for me to watch as it felt real. I have to commend how strong of an actress she is. I hope it's not the case, but I would believe that she is drawing for at least some kind of a real experience.Something I want to add here after this second viewing is Adrian is gas-lighting Cecilia. I'll admit, I didn't necessarily know what that word meant until this viewing. This is an interesting way of doing it, because he is doing different things and then making her take the fall for it. He is pushing the idea that one will believe her.Going from there, to an extent cannot blame those for not believing her in the case of this movie. How can you in a rational world? I think this adds to the fear as well. It is really genius how this plays out as well. During the execution of the will, Tom tells Cecilia that she cannot be convicted of the crime or the will becomes void. What better way to control someone than to drive them insane to control them and frame them so she has to decide. Do you want the money or do you want your freedom? I think in the case with Cecilia and most, it would be peace of mind over the financial piece. This movie does play with that more though with the amount of money is life altering. Is it enough though for what is possible being done to her though?The dynamics around her are interesting as well. Emily is someone who is strong woman which I think Dyer does a great job at portraying. Something happens that upsets her toward Emily and it creates a divide between the two. It isn't done in truth and I really like how strong Cecilia and Emily both are. As a male, as I don't feel I have a fragile ego, I want to see more of that in my movies until it becomes normal. Some might feel that is pandering, but regardless that's how I feel. We also get an interesting character in James and his daughter Sydney. Something happens where they need space and I can't fault him as he has to protect her even over Cecilia. I think Hodge and Reid portray their characters very well.There are two more characters I want to talk about, but I won't for one until a brief spoiler section at the end. I do want to talk about Tom here. There's an interesting reveal with him during a scene with Cecilia when she's locked up. I love that he reveals that he feels similar to her in that Adrian had control over him and that he's glad that his brother is gone as well. The reason I like this is going back to where people know bad relationships are happening and are just complacent in doing anything. It is heartbreaking.It is also paced in a way where it never got boring. I saw that it had a runtime over 120 minutes, so I was curious how things would play out. The only time I might have issues would be the final sequence which I'll delve into a bit in the spoiler section. It really isn't how it plays out, but just how a character is played that for me didn't fit. Jaime disagreed, but I'll get into that. I think it effective built the story. Things get progressively worse until a satisfying conclusion. I like the ending overall as well.That takes me to the effects, which I was curious. I knew in this day and age we would have to go CGI. Surprisingly I thought that were solid. There's a scene in the rain that I was worried about and it was handled very well. The things that were done were good and there are just very minor complaints during the climax. Not enough to ruin anything, but just something that I noticed overall. Something was brought up and after this rewatch, I'm there as well. The suit seems to make the person wearing it have super strength. To an extent some of these things could be done, but not all of them. On top of that, the cameras used in this suit would make some kind of noise. That is an issue as well. The cinematography I thought was very well done as well and is strategic in my opinion.Now with that said, I really liked this movie. It is really a sad tale that is based in reality, but seeing it taken to the extreme. I thought the performances really help to build this realism, especially from Moss. The concept is really good as well. Despite its longer runtime, I think that it never got boring and aside from the final scene, it ends in a way that I like. The CGI has some minor issues. Nothing to ruin it and the soundtrack fit for what was ended. This is a really good movie, borderline on great and will be a contender for the year end if I'm going to be honest. Upon this rewatch during October, my rating has come down slightly. I still think this is really good though. It still should be seen and still a contender for my year end.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10"
1146,Constant terror for me throughout. It was very consistent with its thrills and never failed to make me jump in each scene. It was extremely frustrating to watch but overall a fantastic movie that I never want to see again.
1147,"A classic style suspense movie.
Great performances and a real creepy undertone."
1148,I never watch neither heard about Elizabeth Moss.. But man.. She is so good. I always thought she is new Jodie Foster (watch panic room/flight plan). U will never want to take your eyes elsewhere.
1149,"I have always been a sucker for horror or thriller films. Lately I've seen that a ton of horror and thriller films that came out all just didn't do much justice. But this film blew out all my expectations. A very different kind of film with amazing suspense throughout the whole film. It had me on the edge of my seat at all times; leaving me no moment of boredom. The great acting, writing and setting of this film with that made for a great and entertaining film that I recommend."
1150,"Leigh Whannel has been operating within the horror genre for quite some time now. Primarily known as one of the co-creators of the Saw and Insidious franchises, he's also helmed underappreciated hits from the director's chair with Insidious: Chapter 3 (2015) and Upgrade (2018). Prior to the release of his drastic reimagining of H.G Well's The Invisible Man (1897), I decided to watch the original Universal 1933 classic. It's a somewhat hokey, humorous film, but the effects (for the time) remain impressive. Whannel's modern day revamp follows Cecilia Kass (Moss) who decides to sever ties once and for all with her abusive partner, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohan). Not too long after, Griffin allegedly commits suicide. Believing herself to be truly free from his grasp, Cecilia soon starts to experience strange occurrences that hint towards an unsettling truth; that Adrian may, somehow, still be in pursuit. Nobody believes her, so Cecilia sets out to prove that her abusive ex is far from dead, even if it's at the cost of her own sanity.Way back in 2016, Universal were actively working on revamping their Universal Monsters brand in the form of the Dark Universe. The Invisible Man was originally slated to be a part of this cinematic universe (a move no doubt crafted to compete with the thriving MCU), but once The Mummy (2017, the first film of the proposed Dark Universe) flopped, all plans were scrapped. It's a wonder, therefore, that Whannel's reimagining has even made it to completion. Fortunately, The Invisible Man is a solid and thoroughly engaging thriller. Elizabeth Moss delivers a great central performance, portraying a survivor of emotional/domestic abuse perfectly. A key strength of the film is how Whannel frames a scene; there are various shots that hint towards an unseen observer stalking Cecilia when she's left alone, and it's these shots that (although there isn't anything too substantial going on) convey an underlying menace and tension that elevates the paranoia present throughout the film. It is a frequently tense watch, especially once the true nature of the titular villain is revealed. Whannel doesn't use excessive gore or jump scares (something that littered his screenplays when writing for the Saw and Insidious franchises), and instead favours for moments of genuine suspense. Although the third act does overstay its welcome (a good 10 minutes could have been trimmed from the final cut), The Invisible Man is still a tight thriller that both improves upon and respects the original classic."
1151,"People talk about how modern horror is populated with jump scares and cheap thrills, they'll be pleased with The Invisible Man. Whannell is gaining real traction as a director between this and the underrated Upgrade and this movie represents another step forward with the cinematography and camera work in this. Credit to Stefan Duscio for helping ramp up the tension by showing us enough to see Adrian is there but not enough to wreck the plausibility of Cecilia just seeing shadows of her past. The action also have its moments, when The Invisible Man is attacking Cecilia, the action could have been goofy but the stunt work and the CGI doesn't ruin the vibe and actually adds to it.If you put the excellent cinematography aside, there is another big reason to see this movie. The Invisible Man got me on board the Elizabeth Moss bandwagon. I have never seen The Handmaid's Tale so I was left a little puzzled by all the hype around her as an actress but she's excellent in this. She sells Cecilia's pain and confusion, her frustration and her nagging paranoia. Her character has been through hell and Moss brings to life her turmoil and struggle to get her loved ones to see what she sees when no one else did. We get so little time with Adrian that its hard to say much about Oliver Jackson-Cohen, he's fine in his limited time. I also really enjoyed Aldis Hodge and Storm Reid as James and Sydney Lanier. Storm's a lot better in this as opposed to A Wrinkle in Time and Aldis is great as a protective but an immensely likeable father and friend. Michael Dorman is also appropriately slimy as Tom Griffin, he's channelling Theon Greyjoy's nervous behaviour and secretly devious mindset.I went in to The Invisible Man expecting something fantastic. With almost universal acclaim from the critical community, you know what you're getting largely (unless its an art house picture, then you're rolling the dice no matter what). I have plenty of things to praise in The Invisible Man but there were a couple of missteps. While Whannell and his team expertly shot this movie that's so full of tension, its also a little too slow for its own good sometimes. There's a lot of groundwork laid but I couldn't always buy how little escalation there was in Adrian's plan. The climax does pay off but there was a lot of waiting in stretches and very little reward for the audience's patience. While I did really like what they chose to do with the ending, the overall arc of the plot was very predictable. There are bunch of twists and turns and the movie tries to act like each reveal is shocking, I saw most of it coming from awhile away. It didn't ruin the movie for me but its never a good sign when the audience can guess where the movie is going after the first 30 minutes.If you can choose which part of the movie to get right, save it for the end. An excellent ending can forgive more than a few faults and The Invisible Man mostly sticks the landing. The last couple of scenes leading up to it aren't the strongest, there's a few plot holes that I won't spoil but when Cecilia gets to face what's been tormenting her, she rises to the occasion. They draw the audience's attention to certain buzzwords throughout the run time and then they're weaved into the crescendo impressively. It was close to being a little too precious but I think it was appropriate and it suited the tone the movie was aiming for.The Invisible Man is a beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, tension filled thriller that hits more often than it doesn't. I still found the word of mouth surrounding it a little overblown, its got some big strengths but it isn't the entire package. I'd still recommend it to anyone looking for a tastefully shot horror/thriller, with enough gore to raise eyebrows and an ending that wraps things up just right. But you can catch it on your preferred streaming service if there's no time to get to the theatre."
1152,"Probably alike other people, I went into the cinema thinking about the old The Invisible Man flicks, comics and novels. Forget them. The movie really should have dropped ""the"" from its title to save the confusion. Saying that, this movie is brilliant. It stands on its own credibility. More of thriller than a horror. The movie also it raises some interesting social question too."
1153,"Amazing web-series, absolutely love how the whole series is able to mix forensic science and mythology together. The plotting path was so thrilling and entertaining and the acting was massively done. It was an amazing excitement and hence I completed watching just the whole series in a day. I recommend it to all my friends and family."

1155,"Definitely a really good... sci fi film. It's marketed as a horror movie but in reality, we all know that it's just a really good sci fi movie, there aren't many jump scares, honestly the biggest one was probably the scene with the pooping egg. The ending of the film was very good. Watching this movie, you think to yourself, wow she is an insane person, but we all know she isn't, because us the audience knows that the film is about an invisible man. I could have done with more scary than sci fi, but it did a good job with it. I feel like I got the film spoiled from the trailer because you saw in the trailer the suit when he got the paint all over him. And in the opening scene in the basement of his home, I saw a suit that had the exact same design, so it wasn't. A really shock to me when I found out how he was invisible, so I feel like they could have avoided any sort of spoiler in the trailer. It would have been more enjoyable not knowing how he was invisible from the beginning, the acting was just acting, nothing to spectacular, Elizabeth Moss did a great job capturing an insane person. So I'll give her props for that. I know it sounds like I'm hating on this film, I'm not. I loved it, got to watch it with a group of friends late at night and had a good time."
1156,"The Invisible Man: Great thriller even tough we know the Invisible Man exists. From the opening scenes the tension builds up as Elizabeth Moss escapes from her violent controlling partner. He fakes his death and then begins to gaslight Moss, he's a scientist so a special suit is no problem for him. To onlookers it appears that she is going insane, imagining things, then she seems to attack people. Great SF/Horror drama directed and written by Leigh Whannel. 8/10."
1157,"This film puts a twist on a character as old as time. With practical effects at its helm and not really relying on many jump scares, this film makes you question EVERYTHING you see and everything you hear and leaves viewers at the edge of their seats.Parts of the film are a bit patchy with regards to transportation (how the invisible man gets everywhere) which is hard to look passed at times for very observant movie watchers but for the average watcher it will not be an issue."
1158,"The Invisible Man Review:When Cecilia's abusive ex takes his own life and leaves her his fortune, she suspects his death was a hoax. As a series of coincidences turn lethal, Cecilia works to prove that she is being hunted by someone nobody can see. The Invisible Man is written and directed by Leigh Whannell, the man behind movies such as Upgrade, the Saw franchise, and the Insidious franchise. To be honest, this movie looked really bad to me with the release of its trailer. I assumed it would be another cash grab from Universal attempting to revive their ""Dark Universe"". With that universe they made movies that were both bad and flopped at the box office. If you haven't seen 2017's The Mummy, that basically sums up how bad these movies have been. Flashback to a couple weeks ago and the reviews for The Invisible Man ranged from 85%-92%. There were only a few reviews so I didn't think much of it until it maintained a consistent score from critics and audiences. Rather than waiting to see this for free I saw it opening weekend and was pleasantly surprised to see a horror movie that kept my attention throughout its duration. The screenplay didn't have stereotypical dialogue, like the trailer presented, and had a consistent story. This is a really thought out story. Whannell knows how to write a good screenplay, which he displayed very well in Upgrade. There's a good amount of suspense. Right off the bat, you could tell something was off and the suspense kept building. One of the coolest techniques used throughout is the camera panning to different areas of a room or a hallway with nothing there. Also the camera follows Elizabeth Moss so there's always the sense of someone being there. This happens within the first five minutes already. Also there was some cool imagery I noticed with the original Invisible Man designs hidden throughout. Speaking of Elizabeth Moss, I don't understand how she gets better and better with each role. She takes her character to a new level. The people around her think she's crazy for her beliefs and as an audience member having seen some of the stuff she saw, I still questioned her sanity. She's shown that she's very good with horror roles and I can't wait to see her in her next role, which I believe is Shirley. Benjamin Wallfisch, of course, composed the score and he's good at creating suspenseful music to keep the audience on edge. Overall the suspense was on point. With almost every horror movie, though, there are some plot holes. For a movie that mentions security cameras pretty frequently, there are a few scenes had they just looked at the security cameras everything would've been solved. Halfway through the movie there's a scene in a restaurant, I will say it took me by surprise, that had they just looked back at the tapes the movie probably could've just ended there. It's hard sometimes to find a solution and Whannell tried to move the plot along. The movie can also be predictable at times. There's jump scares throughout, which I guess makes sense however I do not like them much, and you can tell when something bad is happening. I didn't expect much more though. The Invisible Man is a movie that is much better than expected and I would recommend it to horror and sci fi lovers, since it's also a good sci fi movie.My Grade: B+"
1159,"Well I wanted to love this. I was excited going into it after seeing the trailer. I mean Leigh Whannell, right? Not to mention Elizabeth Moss!
The first half of this film was actually pretty good. The second half, ugh not so much. It also felt about 20 mins too long, something I've never said about a Leigh Whannell script.
**Spoilers**
For me the ending scene was like, cue the music, set her mid screen, and fade out....total intro to a franchise. Felt almost super hero-ish. Only thing missing was the words on the screen : ""Coming soon The Invisible Woman."""
1160,When leaving the theater I couldn't help but recognize the major flaws of the plot. The true initiating action is the supposed suicide of Adrian (the invisible man) which later is revealed to be not true. This in itself would be nearly impossible. The show a photo of his dead body which arguably could be staged but when it comes to that how could his death be verified without a body. The brother could not have possible controlled the process of proving his death when there was no body for the police to see. Or if there was a body are we supposed to believe cops would not be able to recognize if he was still alive or at least been in possession of is body. Though there are several other examples of flaws such as the insanely fast quick change ability of Cecilia at the end into the invisibility suit and back out of it all before he was able to bleed out all without making a noise. Also how could she have managed to get to the part of the house with the suit in that time. In the end although this movie does a great job at truly kicking off a dark universe it's plot holes are hard to ignore.
1161,The film itself was pretty good I was enjoying it there was some likeable characters. It was Abit slow at times which was a little frustrating. However i wasn't keen on the ending at all I was dead set on a 7 but the ending made it a 6. We'll never know if Adrian actually had something to do with it which is insanely annoying.
1162,The entire 5/10 goes to the first five minutes of the movie. The rest is predictable and just lots of nonsense. The end is also not a surprise. Too bad for an otherwise decent premise about a hysterical woman who feels overrated by a billionaire.
1163,"Wasn't planning to review but after seeing all this praise I had to. SPOILERS LIKE CRAZY BEWAre. ESPECIALLY # 4.This movie is mediocre at best. Very easy and expected plot and a forced story that is way longer than it could have been.1. In the hospital scene where Moss's character was on the floor and Mr. InvisIble was beating all the guards to death, why didn't she pick up the gun that was right next to her and shoot him in the leg. Why'd she wait 5 minutes, just so we could see some action scene and once he ran out the door, decide to pick up the gun.2. Moss is hard to look at for extended periods of times. Just like Micky Rourke is. All those closeups made me cringe.3. Did the suit give him super strength too? Because we was breaking limbs and throwing people around like rag dolls4. There are plenty of movies where women are in physically abusive relationships, they run away and somehow plot and end up killing the man at the end. And we're supposed to cheer them on? Enough with J. Lo for example. The men never tried to kill the women. At least J lo worked on becoming a fighter. Moss was a coward in her actions. Booooo5. How can someone be on the other side of the room, you get punched in the face and blame them? Booooo"
1164,"I loved this movie. The cinematography, the sound, the plot, and the special effects. The script was not cheesy and Elizabeth moss did an amazing job in her role. The story drew me in from the very start, and kept me watching throughout the whole movie. The reason I Rated this a 9 is because I feel like some more background on the characters was needed. But seriously, well done!"
1165,"The plot sounded interesting, but the movie could've used... a lot. A new main actress, and maybe a director too. The cinematography wasn't great, and whomever was in charge of the audio wasn't given proper directions; sudden and loud bursts of sound does not a horror movie make. I fully believe if it had been done properly, it would have been a great movie.
I was let down by the way it was made, not the plot."
1166,"Now this is how you bring the classic Universal monsters to the modern era. After years of them trying and failing to get it right, even attempting a cinematic universe with these characters, they have finally got it right with this great horror thriller! With an excellent performance from Elisabeth Moss, a great script, well-done suspense, and intense thrills, The Invisible Man is exactly what the studio should've done to bring back these classic monsters in the first place. It also has a great plot twist that I definitely didn't see coming. And now I really hope they will continue and bring the rest of the classic monsters to this time. 8/10"
1167,"I really love this movie for its film score, use of soundtrack to create tension and atmosphere, timing of its suspense / jump scares and of course, Elisabeth Moss's wonderful acting.The cinematography and editing was great, although I felt the movie was a bit too long. The story line / plot twists are a bit predictable like a Scooby Doo episode, but a few of the jump scares / suspense moments were great.This is more of a thriller drama movie, not for action Sci-Fi fans. You could call it a slow-burn psycho horror-like film and the tech/sci-fi stuff is just the side dish.Overall, go watch it especially in an Atmos theater as I think this is one of the few non-action movies I have watched that really use Atmos surround well."
1168,"I am not a fan of horror films, as they tend to become blood lust epics. Whilst there is some blood in this, the film excels in building the thrills through tension and good story telling.
There are some clever Special Effects, but the film does not become a slave to them. Instead you are swept along with Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss), as she tries to navigate the ever increasing insanity that is foisted on her.
Strong performances by the whole cast and a storyline, that once you accept the 'invisibility' premise, is fairly persuasive that the narrative is more or less inevitable.
Good horror works by letting you do the work. Scenes where there is no visible threat, but you know it's there means you help create the tension.
If you like suspense/horror without too much blood and mayhem, this is for you."
1169,Great movie it had a lot of suspense and it's not like most movies now where you can already predict what's gonna happen next I had anxiety the whole movie because I didn't know what was gonna happen It had many jump scares And good plot at first when I saw the trailer I thought it was stupid but the movie made the plot reasonable for it being about an invisible man
1170,"A completely different and enthralling take on H.G. Wells' story as a superbly cast Elisabeth Moss finds herself in an abusive marriage. She drugs her bullying husband (the ever-gorgeous Oliver Jackson-Cohen - a millionaire expert in optical science) with Diazepam and escapes in the middle of the night taking refuge with a cop friend of her sister (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter (Storm Reid). Afraid to even venture to the mail box; she is relieved to hear of her husband's death and to find he has left her $5 million. Soon afterwards, however, spooky things start to happen and she begins to believe that her husband's death was faked... Now we embark on a cleverly told psychological thriller. Moss does all the heavy lifting in this, and she does it really well. It is taut and edgy; at times perhaps a little gratuitously violent, but oddly - by the end - seems perfectly scientifically plausible."
1171,"Went in with an open mind as I didnt know what I was expecting but it wasnt this! Elizabeth Moss is such a great actor and she didnt disappoint in this either. The atmosphere was so tense and there was a few times I almost jumped out of my seat! The only reason I didnt give it 10 is because it's so frustrating watching Ci and everyone thinking shes crazy, but she pulls off crazy pretty well lol. Awesome movie!"
1172,"The Invisible Man is a new horror thriller, partly written and produced by Leigh Whannell, the director of Upgrade and Insidious: Chapter 3.In the film, Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) manages to escape from her violent friend Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). In addition to being violent, Adrian is also a control freak who determined how Cecilia should live her life.
After being freed from her ex for two weeks, she learns that he has committed suicide and given her a lot of money as an inheritance. Despite all the evidence, Cecilia does not want to believe that Adrian has committed suicide. During her research to prove that he is still alive, she notices that she is experiencing many bizarre coincidences. It feels like Adrain is still present in her life, but she cannot see him. As she tries to prove this to her family and friends, they increasingly start to see her as disturbed. Cecilia must now prove that Adrain is still stalking her invisibly before she ends up in a psychiatric institution.Leigh Whannell has once again managed to make an exciting film with this film, even without you actually seeing the danger. He has portrayed the film in such a way that the viewer also feels like there is an extra presence in the film. This movie is a bit like a better Paranormal Activity movie where the characters are also harassed by an invisible demon. Unfortunately, the film loses its horror tension during the film and changes more into a Sci-Fi thriller.If you look at the film too critically, it can sometimes look like a lesser film, because if the main characters had acted a little smarter, she could prove faster that she is being stalked by an invisible person. In some places where she is stalked, you would expect that there would be cameras somewhere that could film that an invisible person is still doing things around her.Elisabeth Moss also performs good and credible acting as someone who is stalked by an invisible person and has to prove this to the rest. The rest of the cast also does good acting as her family and group of friends trying to support her, but gradually believing less and less in her invisible stalker stories."
1173,"This movie had me jumping in my seat the entire time. I love how the character evolves throughout the movie from an abused, insecure victim to a confident aggressor. Excellent performance."
1174,"Pretty dumb movie with a lot of plot holes, but it was entertaining. My local theater chain is going down and I only went to see this to use up my rewards points before it got padlocked or another chain buys it out. They definitely didn't clean up the script on this movie and fill in the plot holes. Elizabeth Moss is also a pretty terrible actress that drags down everything she's in.But anyways, there are a lot of plot holes in the film, starting off. Number one, even if the boyfriend killed himself, cops have to examine the scene, examine the body, the coroner has to sign the death certificate, body has to be given to the funeral home, etc. So people would have to have been paid off to let all this happen, which is just ridiculously unlikely.The whole Invisible Man thing is just so stupid and even more unlikely to work in 2020. The whole plot has to be massaged and contrived to make it all believable. For instance, Moss appears normal and likable to everyone she knows, but they all write her off the minute the Invisible Man does things to hurt her life. Cecilia is across the room from James's daughter before she gets hit out of thin air. Instead of assessing what happened, she immediately wrongly blames Cecilia and the father leaves with her. Had Sydney immediately pointed out what happened rationally, they should have immediately figured out what was going on and believed Cecilia, but the writer couldn't allow that to happen. It's nonsense. Cecilia's sister also gets a vile, nasty email purportedly written by her and totally believes her sister did it when she clearly has no idea what happened, has no history of doing anything like this, has no reason to do it, shuts the door and holds it against her instead of hearing her out or considering that she could plausibly have been hacked at least. The Invisible Man also is superhuman and capable of smashing multiple guards like the Hulk with his bare hands. Punching and smashing people apparently does not damage the capabilities of the suit. During Moss's first encounter with the Invisible Man, he is slashed but the suit isn't compromised until later, when one stab finally damages the suit and makes it visible. What? Way to be consistent!Some issues I had with the suit, which is inspired by the same tech that people hated in the Bond movie ""Die Another Day"", were that it's a bit archaic if you keep up with today's tech. There shouldn't be cameras jutting out, with gaps. The suits material should be something that's all made out of OLED material, which is plausible. This looks like something that would have been made in the eighties, lol. The suit also leaves no shadows. I mean, more power to Oliver if he figured out how to stop that but it seems unlikely. Flashlights, motion detectors, rain, even dust and foreign objects should be visible on The Invisible Man but his suit is always whistle clean everytime, which is remarkably unbelievable. The SWAT team at the end of the movie knows about the Invisible Man but don't even bother to wear thermals in the mansion, which is nuts.There are so many other plot holes, like why Cecilia doesn't ask to investigate where Oliver and Tom's cars are when these attacks happen. Why not walk around the neighborhood and see what you find? Floors have to creak, stuff has to be moved, an big, invisible man would still make a presence.So yes, it is a terrible script, but it's still a fun movie that will cause a lot of discussion amongst your friends. I preferred Hollow Man to this. Hollow Man had an issue with shadows, I think, but for the most part, it was more believable. It could have been a lot better, it's a shame."
1175,"Great acting by everyone, full of suspense and avoided cliches and cheesiness. This was clever and entertaining. Would definitely recommend."
1176,"With The Invisible Man¬∏Leigh Wannel continues his hot streak. This movie blends the fantastical elements and real world horror so well. The actual journey that the main character's on is the same journey so many women escaping abusive relationships face. It's just taken to a much more extreme level and more literal sense with some of the things that she's facing. In part of the struggles of modern day of people getting others to believe their stories, trauma and not to think that they're going crazy. The story of The Invisible Man provides a way to do that. They're having all the thrills and fantastical elements while at the same time it's terrifying and feels real. It doesn't have to do big things in the moments to be terrifying. It slowly builds the tension as this woman tries to continue on with her life, but clearly someone is doing something around her to try and drive her crazy and people don't belive her which ties so much into real world situations. Instead of starting with jumpscares and all typicall horror tactics, it instead looks at what actualy scares people in real life.The movie also relies really well on practical effects rather than CGI. While at the center of it you do of course have visual effects on to make a man invisible, the way this plays out in the scenes is they're using actual real world trickery with things actually moving, rather than CGI objects. So when someone gets hit, you feel it. When someone slams into something, you know that it's real and it just ads this visceral element to this movie that's filled with all kinds of things that we know aren't real, but they feel real.This is a type of movie which doesn't work if you don't buy into the performances. Thankfully, Elizabeth Moss gives a great performance and she feels like a real person, rather than a movie charecter. She's not too charismatic, cool, funny etc. She feels like a real person you would really know and that would do things like this. As you start moving into the part where everyone thinks she's going crazy, you buy into the performance even more because you bought into her as a real person.If you dont know, this movie was made for under $10 million, but it just looks great. The shots are framed so well. Because you're looking for the things moving and what's not supposed to happen, you're paying so much attentiont to the shots which are framed so well and they are gorgeous the way that they're shot. Some of it just looks so clean. I'm seriously wondering how did they make such a cheap movie look so beautifulFinally, the movie just provides the expirience that you want from a horror thriller. Very early on you buy into the character's struggle and you're constantly on the edge of your seat waiting for something bad to happen. Tension is always buliding little bit at a time, it's escolating more and more, and its moving faster and faster. You're getting more and more invested as you watch it and that's what movies should do. You should be getting more into it as the movie goes along.First half of the fim is very slow and deliberately paced. There's not a bunch of jokes to fill in the entertainment nor is it bunch of jumpscares to keep you engaged. You have to buy into it's slow burn nature. I think that's very well done, but people expecting a fast-paced horror movie won't get what they were expecting.The only baf thing about the movie is that in order for the movie to happen, there's a lot of plot conveniences, contrivances and a few gaps in the logic. That pulled me out of the movie at certain points in time.Overall, besides a few plot conviniences here and there, The Invisible Man is a great horror thriller that has a well constructed story, great characters that you belive in and that relies on actual scares that are based of reality, rather than jumpscares.8.6/10 go see it in the theatres."
1177,Only for people who enjoy thrillers. There are few moments where you know it's just fiction. Good acting by people and good visuals.
1178,"I enjoyed it very much. The trailers were trash and totally mislead me. The movie is far better than the trailers. Although it starts of a bit slow, it quickly picks up. The level of intensity was high and kept me at the edge of my seat.I like how the story of this movie is completely different from the novel with the scientific part and the invisible part being the common thing between the novel and the film. I'm glad they didn't copy the plot of the book or else it would have been very predictable which it's not.Elisabeth Moss delivered a fantastic performance. Her acting was very natural and convincing. The direction was also good. Thank you Universal Pictures for finally delivering this movie after so many changes and delays."
1179,"This movie was amazing the pace, twist and turns. I loved how it was shot and directed the whole cast was very good and no one over acted the lead from the hand maiden's tale was perfectly cast. If your looking for a great thrill it is a must see"
1180,"This film is the perfect thriller, slow tension building, great directing, unexpected twists and superb acting from aldis hodge, elisabeth moss and storm reid. oliver jackson-cohen playing the invisible man was a smart casting choice. his acting wasnt on par with the others when he was visible in certain scenes so him being invisible during most of the movie was a good decision."
1181,"The invisible man is perhaps the biggest surprise of the year at least so far,when i saw title of film and clips of trailer i thought this will be another bad horror type that will annoy me with its decisions and scares,but i must say that this is one really great psychological thriller that offered some great storytelling and some great acting and twists,also how invisible man was used in moments he was killing was really brilliantly filmed and cool to look at,elisabeth moss was highlight of entire film and i must say she give one of best performances of year,invisible man is a film that was a big surprise for me and it was great watch"
1182,"SYNOPSIS:
Two weeks after the escape from her abusive boyfriend, Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss), begins to seemingly be stalked by her supposedly now dead boyfriend, Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) who's found a way to be invisible. As no one believes her, she has to find a way to stop the abuse and manipulation.REVIEW:
Leigh Whannell is a Director to look out for from now on. From his work on Insidious to Upgrade and now this? Amazing. In the nicest way ever he is quite the number. I'm never going to look at an empty corner the same way again. I want to start by saying that this isn't a perfect movie. There are minor flaws like continuity errors to having visible breathe in California, which maybe I'm being ignorant to weather, but I lived in California and do not remember it ever being cold enough to see my own breathe. Then you have an Uber driver who one person who goes completely unnoticed somehow. Being able to prove things if you just checked a security feed. However, with that being said, what a damn good film. Like, initially I was spotting these errors then Whannell did one of those *takes finger and pushes chin to make me look away* deals. There is so much yes in this film. He uses the camera to really plant seeds in your head. 20% of this movie is empty corners and chairs and the whole time your thinking ""he is right there, I'm with you Cecilia."" I'm shouting at those oblivious cops who are just too close-minded to see that there is clearly an invisible human RIGHT THERE! Can you not see the camera suggesting it (just completely forgetting they're in a movie)? Some people, am I right? Can't help everyone.Then the acting by Elisabeth Moss... WOW. Is it too early to say Oscar nom? Probably. Either way she was incredible. Another stand-out performance to me was Michael Dorman as Adrian's brother/attorney. His performance was very believable and he was very good at being a character you hate, but also sympathize with. All around the performances were great. This film has so many memorable moments that I know I'll remember throughout the year that's accomplished by superb camera work, sound engineering, acting, pacing and everything else. I will definitely be seeing this film again, not because you have to, but because I want to know if I missed any background details and I simply enjoyed the heck out of this film. Go see it! 8.6/10."
1183,"A bad film that praised by the most pretentious in our society. Hollow Man is a better film than this. Invisible Man is about a scientist driven insane by becoming invisible. In Hollow Man Sebastian couldn't sleep because of his invisibility.Showing a slow decline to sanity.
This film misses the important point about the Invisible Man. He isn't Evil."
1184,"In the world where the quality of movies is going down it is sad that this movie gets such a high rating. Awful plot with many evens which don't correlate with simple logic.
But !!! The real maniac here is this movie's Audio Engineer. In casual moments this guy pushes volume to the maximum. They took casual so called audio drones which you can be found in many affordable audio libraries, and then the mixer just pushes it to some crazy level. Such a cheap production.
Very sad."
1185,"Well, After a long time This thriller movie made me really THRILL. The performance and acting was great indeed, Prove the real creativity of the Director. I enjoyed the movie 1s to last whole time, Not a single minute i was bored. I like these type of linear movies which are rich in story and easy to Understand. Thanks for SURPRISING us with this Amazing movie."
1186,"This is the best horror movie I've seen in a long time.... consistently suspenseful and unpredictable. Moments where I genuinely gasped out loud. An insane roller-coaster ride that thrilled me from start to finish. This is a must-see for fans of the genre like me. And Elisabeth Moss was, of course, incredible in this role. Can't say enough good things about this film. If you have hesitations, go see it. If you love horror, go see it. If you hate horror, go see it. üôåüèº"
1187,Elizabeth Moss is simply magnificent in portraying the constant distress and creating an almost constant tension that I'm not sure I've experience for such sustained periods of time in a cinema. Just the right amount of twists and the perfect score for the film and tone set throughout. A pleasure to watch.
1188,"The original HG Wells story saw the titular character, Griffin, become obsessed by revenge and murder and in this version, the title character is similarly nasty, but is very much a peripheral character as we follow Elisabeth Moss Cecile who escapes from her controlling partner in a brilliantly tense opening. Her fear of Griffin tells us a lot about the power dynamic of the relationship and also serves as a metaphor for a certain type of toxic male. However, we soon are into the thriller aspect - Cecile believes Griffin has developed the ability to become invisible and is stalking her. Is she crazy?
For me this film worked incredibly well. Such a tense and anxiety inducing film, with a few shock scares and a thoughtful ending. Really engrossing and enjoyable. Moss is predictably excellent. She has done a lot of on screen suffering but has an inner steel you totally buy. Although because of that, I do wonder why she didn't leave that awful man earlier!"
1189,"This new incarnation of the Invisible Man story is getting rave reviews thus far upon release. This is likely well-deserved praise, as Blumhouse Productions takes the concept and applies an interesting social dynamic (that of the controlling boyfriend/partner). The problem with some viewers (like myself), however, is that unless you can identify with that specific scenario, there isn't much else to this film.For a very basic overview, ""The Invisible Man"" begins with Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) fleeing from her ultra-controlling boyfriend Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). Though physically escaping his presence, the ordeal has led to Cecilia becoming extremely agoraphobic-until receiving the news that Adrian has passed away (and left her a large sum of money in the process). That solves the problem, right? Not so fast. Just as Cecilia begins coming out of her shell, she's haunted by the seemingly invisible presence of Adrian, of which no one believes, of course.""The Invisible Man"" clearly uses that former horror property to create a metaphor film here for a scenario that many women face (controlling partner). Even when the woman has escaped the relationship, that ""invisible"" presence lingers, if you will. Absolutely nothing wrong with this and I can 100% see why it will strike a chord with many viewers. What it does mean, however, is that the climax/catharsis of the movie will only be reached if the viewer is fully invested in Cecilia extracting her revenge on Adrian. There is almost literally no other driving force to be found here, and that might be somewhat of a problem.What if the viewer can't relate to that scenario at all? Does the film offer anything else besides the metaphor? As a 34-year old, 6'8"" male, I cannot relate to the psychological or physical terror of being controlled by another human being. I can try to ""fake it"", but it simply isn't a scenario that gives me even a bit of pause. Beyond that, unfortunately, ""Invisible Man"" did little else to draw me in.In terms of plot, it is quite predictable. I wish there would have more ambiguity over Cecilia's invisible hauntings. Maybe play up the ""is she crazy, is she not?!"" angle a bit more. But that was never the plan here, as again the reason the film will work with so many viewers is because they'll need to see Cecilia triumph over Adrian in a very physical way.I also didn't find any of the proceedings particularly spooky or unsettling. This was probably due to the predictability of the plot. When I was 99% certain it was indeed Adrian in some sort of invisibility guise the whole time, it sort of took the punch out of things for me.Actually, I think the metaphor angle would have worked much better for me if more had been done with Adrian at the beginning of the movie. While perhaps the mere threat of a controlling partner is enough for some viewers to become invested, I think I could have benefitted from actually seeing Adrian's despicable behavior, which viewers (oddly) really only get at the very end when the outcome is all but decided already. He does come off as incredibly smarmy and villain-worthy, but it was just ""too little, too late"" for me by then.Overall, ""Invisible Man"" is a film that will really, really work if you can become invested in the central premise/metaphor on which it is built. If you can't, though, it will likely lack enough ""anything else"" to keep it from being a rather middling experience."
1190,"Just pure epicness, better than the original. I know that's taboo to say, but it is the truth. They did a hellavu job with this one."
1191,Omg.! You must watch this masterpiece I read the reviews and I see decided to go for it. Best decision ever. The lead actress was dead on. I will be looking for her in the future. Hats off to all the characters. Don't know the director but boy he has a huge future in writing. Thank you for finally üòä giving us a real story.
1192,"This was definitely the best horror/thriller movie I think I've ever seen. Had anyone else been casted or anyone else directed or produced, I think the movie would've been botched. But this movie was very well done. Good jump scares and flowing story that still makes you think and connect the dots."
1193,A perfect reimagining of the original one from 1933. This movie will give you anxiety I tell you but it has also a very important message to give.
1194,"This movie is an absolute train wreck when it comes to plot structure and plausibility. I will leave this spoiler-free as a warning to people who are debating watching it, but the spoilers are ultimately what makes this movie so silly. Without spoilers though; the movie makes ZERO sense. While the acting is great for what they are all given, the plot and script are so silly and laughable that it makes the intensely serious acting equally laughable. Characters have ZERO common sense, public cameras don't exist, dialogue is borderline preschool, and the plot is as if a 15 year old wrote it (a lot of moments that anybody above 20 would say ""okay thats not how this works""). I DO NOT recommend this movie to anyone. Brutal"
1195,"Not sure why there is such glowing praise for this movie other than it was something new to watch in the epic void that is 2020. Cliches abound, not one scene even made me worried let alone scared. I kept thinking it would wrap up by the next scene, and yet one predictable storyline after another kept being added on.I like Elizabeth Moss as an actress but the script was ""eh"" at best."
1196,"The plot is boring, the acting is meh (for the main cast). I'm not a huge fan of horror but I love a good thriller. This was neither. The only redeeming quality was the supporting cast. Elizabeth Moss is lucky to have her ties to the cult of Scientology because there's no way she could legitimately find work as an actress."
1197,"The movie starts promising but other than the music there's nothing scary or thrilling plus they added a dash of terrible acting and you got yourself a wasted time. A crazy lady, a rich ex who supposedly can't get enough of the crazy lady. Plot holes all around. A cop who witnessed a murder and then say nothing at the end"
1198,"I just don't know what's wrong with any director who shoots a film in the dark. Why on earth would you film a movie that no one can see? Unless, of course, it's ""The Invisible Man."" Eureka!Congratulations, you have lived up to the movie's title, in spades. Since I can't see anything, I can't watch it. BTW: the lightbulb has been around for some time. Use it.Just as an aside, Elizabeth Moss has to be the most overused, overrated actor of all time. She almost singlehandedly ruined ""Mad Men,"" but that was just too good. ""The Handmaid's Tale"" was so bad that even she couldn't stand out in the swamp. Still, she was unwatchable. In this movie she was unwatchable, but literally so.In the meantime, I'll wait for the sequel: ""Everything Illuminated."""
1199,This movie was fantastic it was the perfect combination of jump scares and psychological scaring. MUST WATCH!
1200,"Firstly I don't understand the amount of negative reviews on this film. If you liked Woman in Black you will like this film. It works on an emotional level as well as being suspenseful. A lower budget and lack of big names has suited Universal better than their last few "" classic monster"" outings. Don't let the bad reviews put you off, it's rare a film gives me the creeps and this was one of them."
1201,Only a very few plot problems but all shows have that. I liked it. I gave it an 8 and would recommend it for entertainment value.
1202,"This film had so much potential but between the plot holes and the direction it took as a whole it was underwhelming at best. I'm guessing they were hoping to get the audience swept up in the ""action"" that we wouldn't notice the continuity errors, factual errors, or overall dissatisfaction this film brings to the table. Great cast, everyone did really well with the roles they were placed in but the writers missed some critical points in the film that really could have made it great."
1203,"Some lady leaves a house at 3 am in secrecy. And what a mansion it is. Oh and it also has a lab in the basement. Apparently she drugged the man she was in bed with, turns off all alarms, but in the end manages to get a car alarm started. She runs to the closest street where her surprised sister picks her up, just as the guy is about to catch up with them.The lady, Cecilia, ends up at the place of the sister's boyfriend, I think, who is also conveniently a cop. He's got a daughter living with him. Then we learn that the guy was abusive to her, that's why she had to escape. She is still completely paranoid thinking he'll go after her. But then she gets the news that the guy committed suicide. She's approached buy the guy's brother who is also a lawyer and in charge of the estate. The guy left Cecilia millions.But sure enough the guy, now invisible, goes after Cecilia, making her life miserable. He writes an ugly letter to Cecilia's sister pretending to be Cecilia. Then he kills someone and makes it appear like Cecilia did it. She of course claim it's an invisible guy. That gets her thrown in a mental institution. There she is informed that she's pregnant. She's visited by the lawyer again who lets her know that she's losing all the money unless she has the baby and returns to the guy.At the mental institution she executes her plan. She attacks the guy with a pen causing his suit to malfunction, making parts of it visible. Now he has to kill the entire security staff to get away and that gives Cecilia a chance to escape. That leads to a confrontation at the cop's house. But she does want to face the guy one more time to discuss the terms of her surrender so to speak, but there she will take her revenge.The Invisible Man is one awful ridiculously long movie. The intro is about 30 minutes long. It takes another 30 minutes for some action to start. Frankly, I had a hard time caring for any of this. The lousy 3rd rate cast didn't help a bit. Finally at 1 hour 11 minutes there was a death scene that caught my attention, but things didn't quite pick up after that either. The thing just drags along. Any time you hope it will come to an end, there's another 30 or 15 or 10 minutes to go. There's not much worthwhile here. We learn nothing of the science behind the invisibility suit, nothing about the abusive guy. The camera is on the ugly Cecilia the whole time and she has nothing interesting to offer. In good 2000s fashion, this movie attempts to make up for it's lack of ideas, dialogue, visuals with constant insufferably loud noise effects.The Invisible Man is an utter failure of a script and movie. Don't waste your time."
1204,"Excellent movie!Well built, It keeps you in tension and twists.
It creates a minimalist atmosphere in some moments."
1205,Have patience and don't judge anything for 1st 30 mins .A truly fantastic psychological thriller and This was tense from start to finish. and a great take on the horror genre.Brilliant mix of classic tense Hollywood thriller and intellectual comment on gaslighting in relationships (and arguably could be seen as commentary on gaslighting in politics too)
1206,"Thouroughly enjoyed this movie, best film ive watched in ages, had me in suspense for 2 hours, last hour was especially good i thought. Not to everyones liking but best film ive seen since lockdown p.s dont watch trailer spoiler alerts üëç"
1207,"This was a good modern take on the original movie, it was creepy and thrilling. Acting was good. Nice addition to the monster universe reboot"
1208,"I'm sorry but this is dross.
There are a total of 10 minutes interest.
Please avoid."
1209,Really not worth the watch. It's a combination between Hollowman and Enough. Watch one of those instead and save yourself the frustration!
1210,This movie was very well done. The acting was great and the plot was intriguing. We really loved it! It made for a great movie night. Not sure why all the other people on here are leaving such bad reviews- some people over critique movies. Just sit back and enjoy it!
1211,If you can set aside the plot holes mentioned by other reviews then you'll enjoy Moss's great performance and a modern take on The Invisible Man.
1212,"By review title I mean good movie to help you fall asleep. As other reviewers stated, music is louder than dialog so most of movie I just watched and guessed what was going on as husband was sleeping and I didn't want to put volume at full. The plot was ok, kind of vague with no backstory. No, who I am, how I got here, how I know these people explanations straight to this invisible guy is trying to kill/frame me. Nice camera work of panning to empty spaces and conveying feeling of is someone there? But again, dialog was so low and overwhelmed by the music it just ruined it. So, if you want a nice quiet movie to play on repeat while you fall asleep, turn volume down halfway and drift off, you wont be missing anything."
1213,If Hollywood is going to keep making trash like this then I hope it goes bankrupt. Kate moss was a complete joke of a protagonist. Extremely tired acting that becomes increasingly grating after only a short while. Nothing interesting nor redeeming about this film. Save yourself and watch anything else!
1214,"I really enjoyed this one. I like Elizabeth Moss from Handmaiden's Tale and she really did a great job here. Movie picked up right away and kept me glued to the screen throughout. One thing is - even though I accepted the science (fiction) part, several scenes came across as a little unbelievable."
1215,"Unlike majority of people that took the effort to comment here, I find the ending to be quite fine. It may seem messy to some, but I could hardly come up with a better ending myself (then again, I am not a film director). So, I definitely recommend watching this one and not being burdened by low expectations. The movie delivers in every aspect possible and it's probably in top 10 so far in 2020."
1216,The Invisible Man is full of twists and it psychologically plays with your mind. This movie was unique and the acting was incredible. Cinematography was also amazing. Each scene gets you at the edge of your seat and you're left to wonder who's right or wrong. This is a must watch for people who enjoy sci-fi and mystery/thriller.
1217,I don't know what these bad reviews are on about! It's a fantastic movie!
1218,"Great movie, well made and as great as the original.
Id watch again."
1219,Anyone that says this movie isn't scary is wrong. This movie is very creepy which makes it scary for those that actually get the genre.
1220,"Jealous abusive husband, forces a woman to get up the courage to finally leave; which is completely believable, and sometimes it works out and other times it can make things worse. Husband doesn't want to let her go in this case and uses technology to make her and people that care about her, start to question her sanity. I won't ruin the ending, but she figures things out. One of the somewhat ironic things is that in the movie, the main character even asks why her exe-husband is spending his time torturing her; when he has money and is good looking, which really is a question that sticks with you during the movie. Hollow Man was much better."
1221,"Agree with the users here , DOnt know who is giving this title 7+ . No cohesive story or plot. Was boring.. Kate is average in this movie! You cannot make a Dead Cat Bounce is true here."
1222,"Good, enjoyable. Good story. Gets more engaging as it progresses."
1223,"The movie started out very tense, it's totally believable the man sleeping on the bed is some kind of psychopath and the girl is desperately trying to escape. Then after she thought she was safe at her friend's house, the invisible man starts to haunt her.The issue here was the audience didn't know whether if the invisible man was real, which was a good selling point, to keep you guessing. For all we know she might be crazy because of the trauma and the medication and did all those things herself, it could've been an ending like a lot of movies would've ended.But, the movie actually gave us what we wanted to know, and a little too early, that the invisible man was real. This takes away a lot of suspense and what was a thriller becomes a sci-fi, bad(s) vs. good.His brother being a part of this was a twist, but it was uncalled for. It would've been believable if the invisible man was really dead, and his brother had to carry on the ""mission"" to torture this girl. By being ""invisible"", he's not using any tech, but actually using his brother to implement his will, that would've been a decent second half of the film. The main guy is DEAD, better to keep it that way and reveal it at the end that he's still dead.So obviously there are ways to improve this film, but I'm glad I saw it."
1224,"There were many errors, which even I can fix. Watch it and decide for yourself. Hollow Man was a far better movie than this."
1225,"Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) escapes from her controlling partner Adrian Griffin to her friend James Lanier and his daughter Sydney. Two weeks later, she is surprised when her sister Emily comes with the news of Adrian's death. Adrian's brother Tom is handling his estate which leaves Cecilia $5 million. Mysterious things start happening and she suspects Adrian's hand in the matter.I was intrigued with taking the invisible man to the horrors realm. The start needs to give Adrian more time so that the movie has a firmer grasp on its villain. When the situation starts to turn, I get the feeling that the tension is not quite high enough. Looking at an empty room for the invisible man is intriguing for about two minutes. Then I realized that I already know the cause and therefore there is no mystery to the movie. Also, it's unlikely that the dead man is the automatic suspect. I'd go with Tom first and she should be investigating Adrian's death. James is possibly the worst cop ever. A lot of it could be set up with more of Cecilia and Adrian's relationship before the escape. The ending is also problematic. Being over two hours, the last bit should be cut for various reasons. The premise remains intriguing but I would change a few things."
1226,So a guy discovers how to become invisible and his big idea on how to use this ability is to annoy his ex
1227,"The acting in this movie is SUPERB. a lot of foreshadowing that wasn't too obscure and, my god, does this movie know how to handle tension; the first scene had me holding my breath for it's entirety. and the ending is so good and gratifying !!"
1228,Wife and I were wondering if renting for $20 was worth it. It surprisingly was. Wife was on the edge of hr seat. No just a hallowman remake
1229,"It is common for me to come here and have a look before I actually spring for an unknown movie. I didn't do that this time. I should have. I didn't quite get halfway through before I couldn't wait any longer for something to actually happen. I had assumed that this would be some kind of homage to the original classic, with some FX made possible in this modern age. What I found instead was a disjointed mess with a truly irritating lead actress and a fairly inept supporting cast. Plot holes galore, stupid moves, you name it. Another thing; I kept being distracted by the lead's too-white front teeth. They're obviously not real, and probably expensive, so why not choose natural looking ones? Anyway, if they just wanted to make money with this, I guess it succeeded, because it only cost seven million to make, (only? I can remember when that was a lot of money) and they took in a lot more than that. So, a lot of disappointed people walking around. If you're thinking of watching this, think again."
1230,"OMG what a imbecile movie, so childish. a suit full of cameras, thats totally clich√©istic.
Script, acting, dialogues zero, no substance and consistency. The Kevin Bacon remake was way much better, not to say the Chevy Chase version, witch was also a comedy. can't believe the rating, people are sooo superficial nowadays...well Millenials, what else do u want."
1231,Who feed the dog when cislea not in the house????and what she meant by controlling husband..... In that biggest hotel where Emile die... There is no camera ????? In the password she said clearly they met in 14th Dec 2017 year ... In this 2017 no cctv in this world??????
1232,"Very slow, very boring. Fell asleep 13 times. The acting was AMAZING though by the lead female actress. She deserves so much props. I gave it a 5 because there was a few twists that had me like ""oh wow"". But then got bored again 3 minutes after each ""oh wow"" moment."
1233,"This is a great movie, a must see! A really interesting take on the original H.G. Wells story. The beginning put me in mind of the movie 'Sleeping with the Enemy' which is one of my favourite thrillers. This movie is full of drama and twists and true to it's mystery thriller genre. Watch it!"
1234,"There are lots of tension, lots of spookynes, good sound and musical effects, the special effect inkluding its acting are great, the kinda plot has been used before, and youll get what you might have expected, but there are a few glitches and the film lasts a bit too long, so the grumpy old man awards just 6 stars for this, even though it is a recommend."
1235,You want reality? Go live your life. Great flick. Highly recommend.
1236,"Good movie
Have mew idea
I was completely focused with the movie"
1237,"This movie starts with a woman (Elisabeth Moss) escaping her, assumed , abusive husband. Where soon after she is haunted by him after his ""suicide"". Of course Moss tries to convince everyone that he is still alive and haunting her. What you don't expect is the twist of how he is doing it.A refreshing take on all the invisible man type movies (hallow man etc). I won't ruin the ending for you but man are you in for a treat.An unexpectedly Good thriller that leave the audience pleased."
1238,"You know if you look through trash long enough, you might find a gem or two. And it looks like of the two masterminds behind the original SAW, the late bloomer(director of this movie and upgrade) was the real gem. And i have a feeling his meteor is just beginning to catch fire. He has the potential to achieve maybe 80% de palma and 20% kubrick. this movie has many nice ideas and it doesn't really compromise even at the end. The only thing i didn't like was the ending because it completely turns the main character 180. But if you been drudged through too much hollywood trash, this is a much awaited shiny little gem to pickup and put in your pocket."
1239,"Decided to treat myself to a suspenseful flick for my Birthday. Wasn't sure if it would be too bloody for me but as I love suspense, decided to go. Wow! Without giving anything away, this kept me gripped from the first scene! There were several 'boo' moments that caused me to jump out of my seat! However, the whole premise and delivery were very very good! I may make my husband go see it with me!"
1240,"When I first watched the trailer for The Invisible Man a couple of months ago I had no real desire to see it. I've never been into the story and the last iteration was Hollow Man and that was terrible. The trailer looked at best average but the fact that it was being released in the film graveyard that is the first 3 or months of the year I wasn't going to see it.Well, it came out and the reviews and audience reaction were much better than I expected so I decided to see it. It is much better than I thought. In fact, it is a really effect suspense thriller. There are some really quietly intense scenes. It is not really a remake but a reimagining of the invisible man character. It stars Elizabeth Moss as an emotionally abused wife that leaves her rich, controlling husband. The scene that she leaves him is done very well and has some real tension. He suddenly notices she's gone and nearly keeps her from escaping. She escapes to stay with a friend that is a cop.played by Aldis Hodge. Cecilia is obviously very disturbed by the abuse she suffered. She is so afraid of her boyfriend Adrian find her that she doesn't even want to see her sister because Cecilia thinks Adrian would follow her. Soon, Cecilia starts feeling Adrian's presence in her friends house. She goes to Adrian's brother to tell him that he is stalking her. He assures her that he is dead and says that she was left $5 million dollars by Adrian payable in 4 years as long as she was arrested for a crime. Then the film gets very intense. Cecilia is convinced that Adrian is invisible and is after her. Obviously, everyone around her thinks she is crazy. Even her friend that is a cop will not believe her. Obviously as an audience we know he's there but the great thing that director Leigh Whannell does is that he doesn't show Adrian for a while. He suggests he's there subtly. There are long shots that had me scoping to seif Adrian was there. It was really tense for a while. The best thing about this film was Elizabeth Moss as Cecilia. The story is told from her perspective. She carries the film. It is told from a point of view of an abused woman that is haunted by the memory of her supposedly dead husband. The film is more of a psychological thriller than a horror film. Once Adrian appears the film goes into full slasher mode. The reveal is really good. He is determined to ruin Cecilia's life. And he pretty much does. I don't like spoilers but the film has some twists that are not all that surprising but the film does lose steam in the last 20 minutes. All in all it is very well done, probably as good as an invisible man film can be. It's nice to be pleasantly surprised by a film that I originally had no desire to see.Grade: B"
1241,"You may remember The Mummy, with Tom Cruise, it was meant to be the first in a series of Universal Monsters remakes, the ""Dark Universe"" series. But following the negative reviews and underwhelming box office, this project was dropped; any further Universal Monsters remakes will be made as individual stories. The Invisible Man is one of the famous classic movies that would have been part of the franchise, most people will recognise the Claude Rains original. This contemporary reimagining of the scary movie, based on the book by H.G. Wells (although not credited), is one I was most excited about, written and directed by Leigh Whannell (Saw, Insidious, Upgrade). Basically, Cecilia ""Cee"" Kass (The Handmaid's Tale's Elisabeth Moss) is trapped in a violent, controlling relationship with wealthy optics scientist Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). One night, she drugs him with Diazepam and attempts to escape. While trying to take off the dog's shock collar, Cecilia sets off Adrian's car alarm. She rushes to jump over the high fence and to the road where she meets up with her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer) to pick her up. Adrian nearly catches her, but Cecilia manages to escape. Adrian finds the dropped Diazepam bottle on the road. Cecilia hides at the home of her childhood friend James Lanier (Straight Outta Compton's Aldis Hodge), a police detective, and his teenage daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Two weeks later, Cecilia is informed that Adrian has commits suicide and left her $5 million in his will, handled and organized by his brother, Tom (Michael Dorman). As Cecilia tries to move forward, she becomes plagued by various misfortunes and strange occurrences. During a job interview for an architect's position, Cecilia faints and is taken to hospital. The doctor tells her that high levels of Diazepam were found in her system. Shortly thereafter, in her own bathroom, she finds the same bottle she drugged Adrian with. She arranges a meeting with Tom, bringing James with her. She insists that Adrian is still alive, having faked his death, and has used his scientific expertise of optics to become invisible and is tormenting her. Tom disregarding her concerns insists she is letting the memory of Adrian ger to her and explains that his brother abused him also. Cecilia turns to her sister, only to discover she received a hateful email from her account, alienating the siblings. Cecilia goes home to read the email and breaks down. She is comforted by Sydney, until she is hit by an unseen force, she assumes Cecilia did it. A furious James rushes his daughter out of the house. Cecilia tries several tactics to catch the figure, including pouring coffee grounds on the floor to see its footprints. She calls Adrian's old mobile phone number, and hears the ringing coming from the attic. She finds the phone, and finally reveals the invisible figure pouring paint over him. A violent struggle ensues, and she flees the house. Cecilia visits Adrian's home to investigate, finding a scientific laboratory with a number activated keypad in the basement. There she discovers a suit that renders the wearer invisible. She takes it and hides from the figure when it returns, escaping another attack, who is wearing another suit. Cecilia meets with Emily in a restaurant, they reconcile, and Cecilia tries to tell her sister about the situation. Suddenly, the figure grabs a large knife, slits Emily's throat, places it in Cecilia's hand, and frames her for murder, with many witnesses. Cecilia is taken to a secure treatment centre awaiting trial. Whilst there, Cecilia is told that she is pregnant. Tom visits her to inform her that her inheritance has been cut off as it appears that she has committed a crime. Tom tells her that she will lose her fortune and be admitted permanently to the institution unless she agrees to return to Adrian and raise his child. He implies that he helped Adrian stage his suicide, and that he knew she was taking birth control during their time together, which he tampered with. Cecilia refuses but manages to steal a pen from his briefcase, which she uses later to slit her wrist to lure Adrian out. When he tries to stop her, she stabs him repeatedly, causing his suit to malfunction and flicker in and out of visibility, drawing the attention of security. Adrian incapacitates and murders them as he flees, but Cecilia follows him with a security guard's gun. Adrian subdues her and admits that he will not harm her while she is pregnant, so he will kill Sydney instead. Cecilia races to James's house, where she finds the invisible man attacking him and Sydney. She manages to kill him, but unmasking him, she discovers it is Tom. The police arrive at Adrian's house, and find him tied up in a cupboard, he claims he was his brother's prisoners. Cecilia claims that Adrian is playing mind games and sent Tom in his place knowing this would happen. In an attempt to get Adrian to confess, she meets him at his house for dinner to discuss her pregnancy, while James listens in on a wire. Through some difficulty, she does get the information she required, before heading to the bathroom. Moments later, the security camera captures Adrian seemingly committing suicide with a knife, followed by Cecilia emerging from the bathroom, discovering his body, and calling the police. Out of the camera's view, she taunts him one last time. When James arrives and asks what happened, she confirms what the camera saw. James spots the invisibility suit in her bag, possibly realising what she has done, but accepts her story and allows Cecilia to leave. Also starring Benedict Hardie as Marc (Architect), Renee Lim as Doctor Lee, Nicholas Hope as Head Doctor, Sam Smith as Detective Reckley and Nash Edgerton as Security Guard. Moss gives a superb performance as the frightened and tortured but heroic woman stalked and terrorised by the unseen monster. This different perspective of the well-known story is very clever, from the point-of-view of the ex-girlfriend, with great use of optic trickery and camerawork to make you question whether something is there or not, with jumpy moments and plenty of eeriness, a most satisfactory and creepy horror thriller. Very good!"
1242,Gave it a 3 just because of elisabeth moss. I cant understand how this god a cinema release and Upgrade 100x better movie got straight to dvd.... and the movie summ... a man tolls his ex wife there you go
1243,The twist is okay. I love how the movie does not try to scare me but the horror is absolutely there.
1244,"""He said that wherever I went, he would find me, walk right up to me, and I wouldn't be able to see him."" CeciliaAs I sit here thinking about the coronavirus and The Invisible Man at the same time, I realize they both speak the same theme: Forces are out there sometimes almost incomprehensibly lurking in our lives and our imaginations. The Invisible Man is a superior horror-fantasy-thriller that asks you to think about the dangers of living in a film without multiple jump scares and ghoulish bad guys.The imagination does the heavy lifting here with more mind-blowing scares than James Whale's 1933 sci-fi horror treat, where Claude Rains is wrapped in bandages and discarded in the end as a psychological nightmare. The fantasy here seems too real.Bay Area architect Cecilia Kass (Elizabeth Moss) believes her husband's suicide (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) is a hoax. This tech- mogul scientist, she claims, is stalking her despite the suicide evidence. Beyond H.G. Wells's intriguing conceit 120 years ago and this remake in Leigh Whannell's horror-thriller adaptation is the delightful demand the heady horror makes on each person in the audience, who probably has had a relative or two haunting the backroads of memory.Real or not, it doesn't matter because the terror is real enough, and while some of the tropes such as no one believing her story or a jump scare or two, the story relies on the reality of stalking. Like the virus, it can be invisible and therefore more vicious.Cecilia has the usual doubting sister and a cop friend, who has a daughter ripe for being beaten up by the phantom. However, the truly terrible part of the film is the haunting that seems impossible to stop, the abuse Cecilia suffers and no one can see (sound familiar Harvey Weinstein chroniclers). In order to stop it, Cecelia must use her own intelligence and luck just to survive.Pay attention to how these gifted filmmakers draw us in, even though the premise is preposterous. I suspect the real horror is the thoughts we have about our own invisible antagonists and our toxic but unseen abuse no one believes."
1245,"A lot of bad reviews on here. These folk are dissecting this movie piece by piece, counting what appears to them to be plot holes. Many are questioning the believability of such a scenario where someone can wear a body suit, become invisible, and travel from place to place so quickly.I enjoy such a movie by turning off my brain before I enter the movie theatre. I suspend any sense of reality for the 2 hour duration. For me you see, I am there to be entertained. Yes it may be far fetched, but I enjoyed this for what it is - good solid entertainent.
This is a fabulous movie on that entertainment level. Its very gory, and there are a couple of unexpected ""Wow"" moments that are guaranteed to send shivers down the spine. Excellent acting from the lead actress.I thouroughly enjoyed this movie for what it is, entertainment."
1246,"A rather strange take on the Invisible Man story...If taken at the movie's face value, then this is a mediocre thriller with many unexplained / ridiculous logic-less points... Going with this... This movie gets a lame 2-3 out of 10...On the other hand... If one can speculate on those plot issues and come up with an alternate explanation (which changes the story entirely...), Then this could be quite a good movie.Going with my take on what the story twist is... Then the issue becomes the details in story telling... Which wasn't the best in the world...Nevertheless, with my version of the plot, my rating jumps to 6-7 out of 10... Still many unanswered questions but at least more of the movie becomes relatable...
Spoiler alert...
Going the ""face-value"" route... There were many ridiculous actions taken...-- She didn't take the phone from the attic which is her evidence of his existence...
-- She jumped down from the attic when she would be safest up there since he can't climb up without lifting the ladder... She has plenty of time to call for help with the phone in her possession...
-- The scene at the hospital with CCTV clearly showing she was not responsible for any of the killing... Why run when he already left...
-- chasing after something invisible by herself doesn't look like she is afraid of him (something she has claimed from the beginning...)
-- only one of the hospital staff with guns would come out to the car park when she (a patient) is running around the place with a weapon... Hmmmmm...
-- she finds the absolute evidence in the Invisible suit but she hides it instead of bringing it with her to the police?Many many more of such things make me believe this is not really how things unfolded...My take...At one point, she was shown the picture of the dead Alex, which looks suspicious like how she left him at the end...I postulate that she actually did the killing at the beginning of the story... Then she was caught by the police, and what we watched is her explanation to the police on what she claimed happened...She may or may not be crazy but she is the killer and the plot ""holes"" we witnessed are actually her story telling missing many of the details since she was making it up...That last scene of her trying to convince James that Alex killed himself is exactly the position she is stuck in... Trying to explain to/convince the police how it happened...James is just one policeman who reached out to her and she convinced herself that he is her best friend who will side with her...Unexplained points are still her sister's death (can't tell that story unless she is really dead in the manner told...) And Tom's death (or not)... Plus how she escaped from the asylum... Surely these things can be investigated but let's assume she was desperate to bring the story to Alex's suicide and the lies expanded beyond her control...This makes slightly more sense to me but still leaves an unsatisfying taste in my mouth... The story is a bit like ""the life before her eyes"" but messier...Because there is a really good chance that I am wrong about this... Plus some still unexplainable plot points... I can't go to my own version whole heartedly...Hence... My rating for this movie will split the difference and land on a 4.5 out of 10..."
1247,"In 2000 Paul Verhoeven made HOLLOW MAN; a personal vision on the concept of an invisible man. The movie was not a big success but it become a cult one over the years.
If you took that movie and cut off all related to the laboratory and experiments, you basically get 2020 INVISIBLE MAN and stretching of the same but less interesting part of the story. It has some good moments but others are almost boring and the characters and actors do not help too much. Elisabeth Moss does as much as she can but her characters looks more crazy than it should. The rest of the cast mostly unknown are not especially good and basically cliches.
There are some good scenes and some suspense but not enough to compensate for two hours of the main character afraid of her shadow.
In brief; these type of thrillers had been made before without resorting on sci-fi and this is not definitely a sci fi movie.
In brief; avoid it."
1248,"There is intelligent in the mind of the writer and more in the whole movie making. From the sound effects to every other detail. From the first scene to the last one I was on the edge of my seat, gasped for the whole scene with the sister. This is an amazing movie that shows what a controlling relationship can do to both parties. Splendid"
1249,"I was excited going into The Invisible Man, but also a little sceptical because I personally found that Leigh Whannell's last film, Upgrade, was a decent film but definitely overrated. I also chose not to watch any trailers for The Invisible Man, so I didn't know much more than the basic plot and who was starring in it.Thankfully, I was blown away by this film in almost every way. First of all, I have been a big fan of Elizabeth Moss ever since she first appeared as Peggy Olson on Mad Men, over a decade ago. She was also great in Us last year, but she proves in The Invisible Man that her acting is only getting better. I couldn't believe how good she was, and her performance alone was enough to lock me into the story and keep me engaged throughout.The musical score was phenomenal, and the use of sound design was extremely effective. It could have come across as extremely cheesy when Moss' character, Cecilia, was fighting someone that we couldn't see, but the wonderful use of sound design made it all work extremely well.There are plenty of scares in The Invisible Man, and they all had the desired effect. The story started off in a place of fear and paranoia for Cecilia, and then it kept growing from there. It was an extremely well constructed narrative.There were a couple of twists towards the end of the film, one of which I could see coming from a mile off and the other of which happened right at the end and I'm not completely sure if it worked for me. There were also a couple of real-world elements which I had to suspend too much disbelief for, but this wasn't a major detraction from how much I loved The Invisible Man, and I can't wait to see it again.SCORE: 88%"
1250,"I was genuinely surprised that a horror movie like this early in 2020 didn't suck. Most studios just throw out really bad horror movies in January and February just to get rid of them. The Invisible Man is the rare exception. While a had a lot of issues with the film, it still was a very solid effort and did the one thing a horror movie should do, be scary. The film's biggest trait is that it does not rely on cheap jumpscares. It instead relies on a natural build up of tension that pays off with an interesting and unique scare. The film also doesn't continuously use the same type of scare. Some horror movies will continuously use the scary face trope to get a reaction but The Invisible Man doesn't. Each scare is unique in its own way. I won't spoil any of them because they are quite creepy and need to be seen and not explained. Elisabeth Moss does a great job in this film. She is able to communicate this sense of loneliness while being surrounded by everyone and was able to convey the emotions of fear, sadness, and joy in a natural yet intentionally creepy way. The rest of the cast does a fine job but really don't compare to Moss. The only thing holding her performance from being top notch is the screenplay. Some of the lines of dialogue were very awkward and took away from some scenes because of how corny or lame they were. That didn't happen throughout the whole movie but when it did, it was noticeable. The rest of the film's technical aspects were pretty good. The direction from Leigh Whannell was unique and interesting and the cinematography was pretty great. Each shot was visually interesting and had something to offer. The way they shot some of the scenes was great. Exchanges were shot from many different points of view and the camera was able to spin around and follow characters exact movements during action sequences. One technical aspect I took issue with was the score. While the actual composition of the music was good, the repetitiveness of it was a little irritating. The film kept using the same song for more intense scenes and it got distracting after a while. It didn't delve into different ways to use music for scenes with high amounts of tension and I really wish it had done that. The film also has a lot of plot inconsistencies and dumb character decisions. One such inconsistency that isn't spoiler related is when a car crashes. The front of the car is really banged up but it's shown less than a minute later and it's completely fixed. Overall, The Invisible Man is a mostly smart horror movie with a great lead performance, story, direction, and cinematography but is almost undermined by a weak screenplay, plot inconsistencies, and dumb character decisions."
1251,"Excellent movie! The writing, Moss was AMAZING! I just love her as an actress. It was not so much a horror as in terrifying, but more on the edge of your seat which we were! Highly recommend. Best movie we have seen in a long time."
1252,"The invisible man can trick the viewers into thinking they are watching just another cheap suspense thriller - a victim that, after running away from its murderer, finds a path to revenge.
The plot twist was unexpected and very well put into the narrative. The whole movie is very well written, the key shots made in the beginning all correlate to essential parts of the story later on.
The somnoplasty is pretty much astounding, every breath feels as real as the suspense music that surrounds the characters throughout the very intense scenes.
Overall"
1253,"THE INVISIBLE MAN is GREAT. Masterful, great pacing and suspenseful from the start, and actually SCARY. Most films these days have silly dialogue or the characters do stupid things that knock me out of the movie, but not here. Dialogue was sharp and realistic, and the movie kept up great suspense.
Universal studios had planned to do a Monsterverse with all the famous monsters, but when The Mummy under performed, they decided to change course and paired up with horror factory Blumhouse to make a real horror movie. Above all, it was unique. HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.
This director, Leigh Whannell, previously gave us the action thriller UPGRADE, and is now in pre-production on the remake of ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. So that project is in good hands. Can't wait."
1254,"Often times I want a movie to hurry up and end because the last 30 minutes tend to drag. 'The Invisible Man' however, is one I didn't want to end. It had my attention the whole way through and was So intense! Go in with an empty bladder because you will not want to miss even a few minutes on a toilet break! Definitely recommend for those thriller fans out there!"
1255,"I asked my husband if he liked it when we left the theater and he said ""I felt tense the whole time."" That's a good thing in this scenario...You have read enough reviews to know the story but, believe me, not every cast could have pulled this off...Elizabeth Moss is an incredible actress and her emotions and terror felt real. The supporting cast were amazing (and not at all hard on the eyes!) I didn't ""see"" the abusive ex until more than halfway through the film and although I also hadn't heard much about him, I found him terrifying. The score was excellent although a little loud for us (we're old! :)) It really helped to build the tension. I loved this movie and would see it again...I'm not a huge fan of violence but it was appropriate to progress the story...Just know that this is not for anyone under 18 in my opinion...It's quick, but it's graphic....All in all, highly recommend for thrill seekers and fans of psychological dramas...."
1256,"Leigh Whannell, known for creating a small but yet effective sci-fi film Upgrade, takes the left-over of a failed cinematic universe and turns it into one of the most intense psychological thrillers I have seen in years.After escaping from her abusive husband Adrian, Cecilia struggles to adjust having her freedom knowing that one day he will find her. And while his apparent suicide may seem good news for her, Cecilia realises soon after strange things start happening her still-living ex has invented an invisibility suit to do one thing: torment her life even more than before.While it is technically another remake of a 1930's horror icon, Leigh Whannell's reboot has more in common in with this generation's social horror thrillers like Black Mirror and Jordan Peele's Us and Get Out. Whannell uses the story of a woman being stalked and gaslighted by her invisible ex-spouse to explore the real-life horror stories that were revealed during #MeToo from victimized and abused woman. While we don't actually see what her toxic relationship with Adrian was like before she left, the story makes sure that we as the audience never question what Cecilla actually believes but to morally question everyone else choosing not to believe her even if the idea of an invisible man sounds crazy. By limiting the actual screen time of the Invisible Man's visible form of Adrian played creepily by Haunting of Hill House's Oliver Jackson Harper, Whannell makes sure that we focus on how damaged and hurt his victim is rather than relate to the title character himself. The story establishes very early on that Adrian's invisibility is not what makes him a monster but his cruel mind games on Cecilia that he feels is justified in his own sick way.Whannell knows in order to make a movie about an unseen assailant scary is to not rely on visuals. Long, drawn-out scenes with no score but with incredible sound design sets in the dreadful atmosphere. Stefan Duscio's cinematography weaponizes wide shots of empty corners, hallways and rooms to show how isolated and vulnerable Cecilia is while making you as audience feel paranoid if Adrian is listening and watching. And once the Invisible man does strike, Whannel crafts his attack sequence in very raw and physically brutal ways to reflect the horror of abusive relationships. Even when we visibly see Adrian wearing the suit that makes him becomes the titled villain, the tech-based design gives off a surprising creepy Lovecraftian feel. Once the score made by Blade Runner 2049's Benjamin Wallfisch does kick in, the mixture of classic orchestral music to loud jarring electronic beats makes the scenes feel even more intense and dreadful then they already are.But what sells the cruelty and terror of the Invisible Man is Elizabeth Moss's amazing performance. The small moments of her joy and happiness she has with her friends and family show what Cecilia's life could be like if she didn't have Adrian controlling it. But once Adrian goes full invisible, Moss makes you feel what is it like to be a victim who feels trapped and hopeless. From her just starring at what appears to be nothing or talking to empty space, we buy that her character is both terrified yet also frustrated with being used or ignored by others. Moss's grounded acting helps keep the movie's premise from going too far into a campy slasher film.The collaboration of Elizabbeth Moss as a performer and Leigh Whannell in the director chair make this modern-day reincarnation of The Invisible Man a true horror masterpiece."
1257,"A modern version of the classic horror story this time focusing on the madness of the victim rather than the invisible man. The plot is well thought out and the special effects / action scenes are well put together and it successfully builds up the tension and suspense before going for the physical violence. Great performance from Moss and good use of camera shots to add to the atmosphere, but is a bit long overall and the surprises aren't that surprising."
1258,"Been laughing so hard at all the criticism around here because ""feminism has to be everywhere"". Jesus christ u all talk so much about feminism being angry and pointless. Guess who's being pointless and angry at a movie that's not even feminist. It's just a person getting revenge at their abuser... like so many movies.... lolGreat movie btw, great plot, it was one of the best movies of the year so far for me."
1259,"The Invisible Man is a good film with an amazing cast, Elisabeth Moss is oustanding. The script is fine with creepy scenes, a lot of suspense and an action touch. Not a masterpiece but a good film. The cinematography is correct and the special effects are cool. An entertaining film."
1260,"Part ghost story, part psychological thriller...if you've lived in the time of late 80's to early 90's thrillers such as ""Final Analysis"" or ""Basic Instinct"" you will appreciate this movie a lot more. Resident pasty victim Elizabeth Moss plays Cecilia, fresh off escaping a bat-nuts husband now has to contend with his suicide. She is traumatized to the 1000th power and now lives in constant fear regardless of his supposed death. In her escape, she has been ""gifted"" a lot of money, IF she can keep out of trouble. What a strange addition to a will, you say. Yeah, BIG dumb thing. However, she takes his gift but is now haunted by some apparition that creaks floorboards, pulls sheets off beds and so...well, typical for a movie like ""Paranormal Activity"" Unfortunately, the trailer gave away a lot. In fact, wish it wasn't named the way it was, because we know science is involved. How much science? No one seems to care. Only that the master of optics has created something that gives him powers to take his abuse to another level. Do they ever explain why the somewhat less than modelesque Moss gets the stalker treatment even though smart, handsome science guy can have ANY girl he wants? Nope. Only that that is pretty honest to what an abusive relationship can look like. Power and picking on the abused.
Look, there are a TON of questions left unanswered, but for a late February movie and with unrecognizable actors, it's a homerun...I'd say. Let your expectations be what they are, but I like Moss. She's like Jodie Foster's little sister. And hard to believe she is the same person from ""Mad Men"" or the earlier reviewed ""Her Smell."" I would say, in terms of having REAL women play these roles, it's great to see her in a lot of these flicks. Empowering as it may seem or ""woke"" as it may try, it's still a solid thriller in the above mentioned films. A LOT isn't just special FX heavy, it's actually simple tricks to give you the creeps. And made even more impressive that most of the time, Moss acts to nothing."
1261,"I have to be honest and admit I wasn't entirely bothered by this movie. Oh yay, another adaptation of a horror classic, and possibly the worst one to boot. Sure, Leigh Whannell is behind the camera and Upgrade was a welcome surprise in quality, and as much as I dislike Elisabeth Moss, there is no denying how downright talented she is. But I mean, the invisible man? Really? Oh boy was I surprised!We follow Cecilia, a victim of an abusive relationship with a wealthy and respected technology invigorator. The film opens with her escaping him, and I use that word carefully. She didn't leave him, she escaped. She has to rig the cameras and drug the guy in order to jump the eight foot wall that surrounds their property. Even the dog has a stun collar on to prevent him from leaving the immediate area. Crucially though, we never get flashbacks to the abuse, only a half-hearted retelling from Cecilia herself. Unfortunately for Cecilia, Adrian's field of work is optics, and he's just created a way to turn invisible. He fakes his own death and uses his newfound technological marvel to haunt and gaslight her at every opportunity.It starts small at first, like turning up the hob when she leaves the kitchen, but it quickly escalates to footsteps on a bedsheet, and even further to hitting a child in her vicinity. Tormenting turns into framing and separating her from her support network, and pushing her to the point where she comes across as insane to anyone who will listen. This last point in particular made the film a real talking point for survivors of domestic abuse, because many victims face that very same wall when they seek help. Of course for Cecilia it's amped up to eleven, but nonetheless the feeling of being a victim ignored and disbelieved every time is sure to hit home to those who have actually been there.While the movie does a really good job with the story in many regards, like focussing on Cecilia and her struggles rather than the titular invisible man, and offering a number of unexpected moments that turn the film completely on its head, there are still some problems to be addressed. I guess this is going to get nitpicky, because honestly these points didn't really matter a whole lot, but they're worth considering. At one point Cecilia goes to her sister for help, but she's met with aggressiveness and a door slammed in her face thanks to an email sent from her account. In the email she tells her sister things like ""I never want to see you again"" and ""I wish you died instead"" Besides being quite clearly out of character, why would someone say those things and then immediately knock on their door looking for help. If I was the sister, I wouldn't have been grumpy and slammed the door in her face, I'd have been utterly confused and urge to know more; try and work out where the email came from and why.There's also the small matter of shadows, in which I mean the invisible man doesn't cast one. He doesn't bend light itself, so he would still block light from its source and cause a shadow, but not here. He is completely and utterly invisible until something happens to reveal him, from rain to paint to extinguisher foam. This is a really small nitpick though because it opens the way for the film's strongest and most enthralling aspect; negative space. Stefan Duscio's cinematography is absolutely fantastic, constantly lingering on empty spaces in a room. The way the camera will pan away from a character in order to look at an empty hallway, or just linger on a wide shot when the character walks out of it, or follow nothingness around corners, or literally just have shots of empty corners or doorways, or peak through doors and windows as if being watched, or even when there is a character on screen and the shot is framed in such a way that it feels like there should be a second character filling space but there isn't. This not only adds huge amounts of tension and anxiety to the movie, but it's also an ingenious way to actually film an invisible character. There's nothing in these shots, but thanks to the context of the movie, you know there is something there. You spend the whole time watching for small movements, scanning the area for hints of what's lurking in plain sight. I can tell you, it makes you very hyper aware of the empty spaces in your own home. And this isn't even mentioning the fantastic longshot action sequence in a hospital ward.Usually I'm a little hesitant to see horror movies in the cinema, and the main reason for that is jump-scares. On a big screen in a dark room with surround sound, jump-scares are dialled up to eleven. Even the mention of a ghost in Parasite last week sent me into an irrational panic. But here I figured it's just a dude. An invisible dude, sure, but a dude nonetheless. And it's true, there's nothing supernatural about this movie at all. In fact it's alarmingly grounded and realistic. Not only that, but the guy's invisible right? That means the trope of turning on the light to reveal something terrifying cannot physically fit in this movie. I'll be totally fine! I wasn't. Oh man I really wasn't. This movie is jumpy as hell. It made me jump harder than I've jumped watching a movie in a long time, with sudden rushes of adrenaline and my back going up like a cat. The biggest offender for me is a pretty obvious one; he gets doused in paint, suddenly revealing him. I went in expecting this, because honestly it's the most obvious way to reveal something invisible. But the way it's done, building the tension and putting in multiple camera angles of the situation, and then making everything suddenly happen so blisteringly quick that you don't have time to process the situation. She grabs the paint and chucks it, revealing him super close, and she lurches back to the corner of the room, all in the space of a single second. I didn't even register there was a can of paint there until she was huddled in the corner, so it took me completely by surprise. There are other moments as well, like an unpredictable event at a restaurant, random glitching causing him to reappear and disappear, and unforeseen hits and punches that literally come out of nowhere, but none of them made me jump more than the most obvious one in the whole movie.Crucially though, none of those jump-scares felt cheap or relentless. They're well-placed and serve the film really well in service of the tension and general feeling of unease, rather than the other way round. The film's horror lies in the unseen, in the empty spaces, in the not-knowing, in being slowly driven insane by an abusive ex given the ultimate power over you. The invisible man is a stalker through and through, constantly making you feel like you're being watched, that someone's there with you. That's not a supernatural fear. It's not even an unlikely fear. It's something we've all experienced from time-to-time, and this film captures that feeling perfectly.Once again, Elisabeth Moss sells everything about her performance, from the desperate pleas to be believed, to the outright terror she endures, to the self-confidence of getting her pound of flesh. There is nothing this woman cannot do, and as much as I'm not really a fan of her, there is no denying how insanely talented she is. The rest of the cast do really well, particularly Oliver Jackson-Cohen as Adrian and Aldis Hodge as James.The Invisible Man was definitely a surprise, in more ways than one. The trailer doesn't instill an awful lot of confidence, but Whannell has successfully delivered another smart movie brimming with creativity. There's twists and turns, ingenious use of camera work, a tightly-written story despite a number of plot holes (how did he always know where she was, all the time?), and a fantastic lead performance. I give The Invisible Man a flawed 8/10."
1262,"Remember when Universal Studios planned to remake all the Universal Monsters movies and turn them into a Marvel-esque franchise (the planned saga was called: The Dark Universe)? Man, I am so happy that didn't work out. Thank God Tom Cruise's ""The Mummy"" flopped as hard as it did, because we might have had another boring, artless PG-13 schlockfest instead of receiving Leigh Whannell's ""The Invisible Man."" As a side note, when I sat down to review this movie, I released I'd unintentionally seen all three of Whannell's films: ""Insidious: Chapter III"" (very blah), ""Upgrade"" (decent, but familiar), and now this (the best thing I've seen from him yet).Don't get me wrong: this movie is not perfect, there are plenty of issues with it. There were dozens of times when I thought to myself, ""No one would really do something like this unless it were to further the plot,"" or ""Do people really talk to each other like that?"" Still, if I had to choose between an actiony remake of a Universal Monster flick, or a more horror-based remake like this one, I'd choose this horror remake every time. While there may be dozens (and I mean dozens) of tiny problems with this movie, there are some truly great and shocking scenes, and the way this movie handles some of the crazier, more violent stuff in this movie is pretty darn awesome.If you compare it to movies like ""Hereditary"" or ""The Witch"", this movie is laughable. I've given this a 3.5/5 Star rating, because I think this is one of the better MAINSTREAM horror movies I've seen in recent memory. It might not be as artistically intriguing as ""Gretel & Hansel"" or ""The Lodge"" (the only other horror movies I've seen from 2020 thus far), but it is a hell of a lot more fun than both of them. ""The Invisible Man"" won't reinvent the horror genre, but it is good escapist entertainment."
1263,"The Invisible Man is the brand new Blumhouse production. As expected, it is a horror movie that also deals with another genre. Here it is the science fiction. After criticly aclaimed movies such as Get Out or Us, by the well known Jordan Peele, it was time for viewers to experience an original story, written and directed by Leigh Whannell. I didn't know this director and I also didn't know that much about this movie. I only saw one trailer, and I didn't read any reviews, which I think was the best idea to fully appreciate this kind of movie.
The story is about a woman, who is terrified by his boyfriend who decided to fake his death, and starts to terrifies her, by literraly being an Invisible man.
I really enjoyed this movie! It is my favorite movie of the year so far! It's been only 2 months, but I can tell you that I had a great time! The story in itself is not inovative, but the way the filmmaker is building the tension is really impressive! All the shots in the house helps to create this creepy atmosphere of being watched by someone who is invisible. I also loved how he does use the jump scares at the right moment! Moreover, thank you for all of these scary scenes without music! Finally a guy who understand how to scared the audience!
Spoiler alert: the 2 twists really worked on me! Maybe that I was too dump to get them, but I don't care! At least, it worked!
I only have few negative points:
At the end of the 2nd act, it was no longer scary when it was the invisible man point of viewI understand that Adrian is a sociopath-killer, but I would have appreciate to have a little bit more background about his relationship with CeciliaThe dog? What's the purpose of this dog? In my opinion, he is useless"
1264,"An 'UPGRADE' to his brilliant directorial debut, pardon the pun.... This followup proves Leigh Whanell's wonderful n unique eye, his style refined even further here. Tense, scary, unnerving although straightforward.... This is such a great movie, I loved it, highly recommended. To have experienced it in a full house with dead silence was great. What can I say about Elisabeth Moss, fan of her since the Mad Men days, then the Handmaid's Tale. She is one of the finest of our generation."
1265,"Invisible man is good and suspenseful. However, its not to be taken serious. Just a good pass time"
1266,This movie is a waste of time. Garbage 2020 I have never seen a movie like this ridiculous. And a poor story
1267,"Scoobydoish stupid boring reimagening of a classic concept...even the invisible man with kevin ""crispy"" bacon was a better remake....stupid dont waste your time!!!"
1268,"First of all, I would like to say that this movie was the best movie I watched for a long while. Its beginning was not cliche, the thrill at the beginning made me feel more excited for the movie. I think the personality of the main character was really good, unlike the classic main characters in other movies. The development of the story was actually really evocatory. I never got bored during the movie and the ending was pretty satisfactory. The action and the tension of the film were in point. I also loved how the costume that provided invisibility and its structure were shown, it made the movie more realistic. And lots of people are saying that this movie has a lot of plot holes, but I don't think it does! For me everything was sensible. If you haven't watched this movie, go and give it a chance! I think it will be worth."
1269,"Two valuables hours of my life that wouldn't come back, don't waste your time watching this, the lack of human morality and sense in characters makes this movie an unrealistic junk. Hollywood has forgotten how to make good movies, it is over five years that I haven't seen a good movie comes out of Hollywood."
1270,I could see the invisible man. This movie should be called The Invisiblen't Man. I hate this damn movie bacause i coule see the invisible man. END OF STORY.
1271,"This movie is bad. And I mean bad, bad. One of the worst rip offs I've ever seen, as in how cheated you feel after wasting your precious time watching it.I'll be direct: everything you think is happening, is really happening, and every plot hole you see, even the bigger ones, are never ever covered.Just a quick example: cameras. They are everywhere BUT the places they absolutely need to be, say, a damn restaurant. It is so bad it is cringeworthy. No reason for the things that happen, not to say for how people act in this movie. It is one of those ""dumb teenagers in a horror movie"" kind of people.Skip it. Thank me later."
1272,"Once again, she did it again! Elisabeth Moss plays an excellent character in this movie. I don't think they could've just picked any actress to play her role and I don't think she could've played it any better than she did! I fell in love with her in the show called ""The Handmaids Tale"" and now I'm absolutely in love with any movie she plays in. If you want to watch a kick ass thriller movie, watch this one. Not to mention, the ending is amazing which really counts!"
1273,"Low grade effects, bad story, a horrible ""twist"". This film is just all around trash. There is nothing that could save this movie from itself."
1274,"I went on to the movies to watch this film without even watching the trailer, or hearing from it from friends or reading any reviews, so my judgement of the plot was based on the last movie I went to see which was about invisibility, and that was John Carpenter's Memoirs of an Invisible Man (1992), starring Chevy Chase and Daryl Hannah, a film I don't have words to describe, but maybe you should check it out if you found your taste in the garbage can like I did.My expectations were below the line and I got pleasantly surprised by this film. It is not a film about discovering invisibility or about science fiction, it's not even about the social implications of invisibility. Science play a minor part in this film, which is great because when you go for the title, you expect to watch something that will develop around the amazement of the possibility of being a transparent and how well the FX team got it on screen. Like Chevy Chase chewing gum or wearing makeup in that scene.Well, but what is it about? It is about abuse in a relationship. And in here I draw an outstanding reference (which I think the director had in mind) from another movie, a classic called Sleeping With the Enemy (1991), with Julia Roberts in her prime, and Patrick Bergin vigorously playing the villainous husband. In this film, Julia Robert's character, Laura, is a captive wife in an awesome designer house by a beautiful beach. The movie theme explores how a marriage can seem perfect from the outside and abusive from the inside, how people can turn whatever feelings of love they have into possession an then into obsession and of course, it explores fear (it's a dramatic thriller).This film has left a huge mark on me because, being a young man, I couldn't understand how women let themselves be involved in abusive relationships to the point of being violated in every way by someone who should love them (and clearly does not), and chose to stay in that situation only waiting to be abused again. This film made me understand the part fear takes in an abusive relationship, and how trauma is driven from this fear and instrumentally placed over the love as to drive women so insecure, so fragile that they become highly paranoid and obsessive about their own actions and how those actions could trigger a situation they want avoid at all costs. It's a really powerful movie and a powerful feeling, and the thrill of being able to experience the point of view of a woman in this situation is even more powerful as a statement. The film also gives a statement about a the heroic courage of the character to engineer a fail-safe plan to leave this relationship, and has a ""rebirth from the ashes"" theme also.The Invisible Man drinks HEAVILY on that, as even the designer house by the beach (but in a cliff by a beach) is in the movie. There's an abusive husband, a ""perfect"" marriage, and the overcautious and brave abused wife, which escapes violent obsessed husband only to be haunted by the trauma of him suddenly appearing and hijacking her back to him.The elements are all really well placed, but the movie then tweaks this by turning the husband invisible. And here's when the thriller alarm goes wild and you start to scratch the arms of the movie seat as the point of view of the paranoid abused wife becomes THE moral question. Gaslighting is brought on screen as we watch our heroine pour coffee powder on the floor trying to proof that someone who shouldn't be there is actually right there. It goes on taking from us all the possible flooring we could stand on, as we watch the invisible man cornering her more and more into madness, even murdering people and blaming it on her. And as a brave female hollywood protagonist could only, she crawls out from the bottomless pit of structural female discredit (she gets institutionalized) and finds a way to hurt her creepy ghost stalker back by herself as help won't come from anyone - even the tall, muscular, mindful and terribly handsome police officer who takes her in after she escapes from her husband -, and finally gets to higher ground.This film has a really well balanced measurement of pain and pleasure, as it ends with a vindictive ingenious supper with protagonist and antagonist giving perfect closure to the story. I couldn't really ask for more."
1275,I simply watched out of curiosity. If you want to waste a couple hours.
1276,"I really enjoyed this movie. I'm kind of a baby when it comes to ""scary"" movies. I watched this alone and was honestly afraid to sleep because I kept thinking someone was watching me. This movie had me talking to the TV telling Cecelia to DO SOMETHING! And after watching it a second time I love it even more! There's an element of SURPRISE! And little things that I didnt catch the first time watching it. Please watch this. Also, Elizabeth Moss does an amazing job."
1277,"Elisabeth Moss is in at least 80% of the frames. And she goes around looking as she always does, which is: As if she hadn¬¥t had one single day of fun in her whole life. She is neither a good actor or pretty. So yeah, she nails it: We get the exact same Elisabeth Moss as we always do. Without her, this movie would have scored higher."
1278,"Disappointing film.
So many glaring plot holes and badly written characters one of which we never truly know who he is or why there other than a thin plot device. Script is poor, story barely exists.Same long drawn out shots of nothing hoping to build some kind of tension.
Skne of the dumbest decision making I've seen anyone make in a film since The Strangers......just can't see anyone doing some of the idiotic things she does.
Kne minute hes clutching, next all working fine, paint like water.....even emulsion not that thin and couldnt rinse off that quick. ........also the second half gets worse as it progresses.
Ending was lame.Just watch the original or better still the far superior HOLLOW MAN if want an updated gripping version of the invisible man."
1279,"In your average horror movie I am continuously scanning the background, but in Leigh Whannell's adaptation of The Invisible Man the horror is right behind you. You just cannot see it. The film is part of the Universal Dark Universe franchise, but reimagined by Leigh. Elisabeth Moss creeps around the gorgeous house, great production design by Alex Holmes, we are led to believe she has drugged her wealthy boyfriend Adrian played by Emerald City's Lucas; Oliver Jackson-Cohen. And in those few moments you could cut the tension with a knife.Barely escaping from this gilded prison with her sister's help, Cecilia finds refuge with her friend James and his daughter Sydney, but always feels someone is watching her. Attempting to beat her agoraphobia she eventually makes it out of the door to the mail box. A small victory. But when Adrian commits suicide, Cecilia's fears are over. With her and Harriet Dyer's sister Emily both amazed when he leaves $5 million to Cecilia, with a few unlikely codicils. But Adrian's lawyer Tom, his own brother, played by For All Mankind's Michael Dorman, assures her everything is fine.And it is. Using Adrian's $10,000 a month will allowance Cecilia sets up a Parsons College fund for Sydney, Storm Reid playing thecool daughter of Aldis Hodge's policeman James. And Cecelia feeling confident enough to work again, but why are her architectural drawings suddenly gone from her case during her interview?, and why is Diazepam suddenly on the bathroom counter?, the same medicine she used to drug Adrian, as she passes out. The hospital results show she had high levels of the Diazepam in her blood. She never took the pills.But Cecilia starts to wonder what if tech billionaire Adrian isn't actually dead, what if he created a way to make himself invisible? Could the man who abused her while he was alive, still be psychologically, and worse, terrorising her in his 'death'? We can see the duvet slipping off the bed, we know someone's there, as the photo is taken, but we cannot see him. Maybe just a foot outline on a sheet.I don't know HG Wells's The Invisible Man, other than there was a series with David McCallum when I was a kid. But Leigh Whannell has created a monster who question's Cecilia's sanity and in a shocking OMG moment ultimately robs her of her family. If no one can see her tormentor, then no one can help. But Cecilia has survived worse when living with Adrian, the painful admitting to James and Emily of the awful life she had is heartbreaking. Apparently self harm scenes were cut from the UK version which would have showed even more the psychological harm he caused her. And I cannot think of a better actress to play Cecilia than Elisabeth Moss, we are willing to invest in her as the abused woman who takes the fight to her abuser. With Tom offering Cecilia a menacing option we're totally up for it. Especially as Cecilia has an ace up her sleeve in this chilling sci-fi thriller.A terrific script and big success for Blumhouse. They are really having a moment with three of their films currently in cinemas. With an impressive score by Benjamin Wallfisch and haunting cinematography by Stefan Duscio that together builds up the suspense. As a horror fan this was superb from Leigh Whannell. The loft scenes were fantastic but it isn't relying only on the jumpy moments. Far too sophisticated a piece of work for that. Well done to the cast and crew."
1280,"Directed by Leigh Whannel and starring Elisabeth Moss, Oliver Jackson-Cohen and Aldis Hodge, it's actually pretty good.I will praise the film on its focus to tell a good, neat story instead of world-building or franchise-creating. The directing is pretty well done by Whannel, with well-done clever camerawork always hinting the prescence of ""the invisible man"". The jumpscares also feel rather nostalgic, yet surprisingly refreshing. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch is also terrific and equally haunting. It also feels very modern which honestly is perfect.I suppose a flaw could be the lack of characterisation in, well, any of the characters. Even for Cecilia, other than her past experiences, we are never properly introduced to her as a person. Just more as a victim, which isn't false.There are also a few plot-holes in the writing, but they aren't the ones big enough to fall into and are easily overlooked.I suppose The Invisible Man proves that remakes aren't always a bad thing, as long as it stays composed and focused on the main objective: to make a good movie. And that's exactly what it did."
1281,"Another Great Film By Blumhouse. They are Making Horror Cool With The Young People while Putting Out Good Movies for the Rest Of Us. This One is a Buffet Of Thrills. The Action In this Kinda Reminded me Of Terminator 2. It Had that Feeling of a Horror Movie. Elizabeth Moss did a Fine Acting Job in It Too, The Action With The Actors Goin Up Against a Invisible Enemy was Great Too!! This Film Delivered!!"
1282,"This is a near perfect horror/thriller, with little excess and an intricate plot that fits its pieces together perfectly. Beautifully acted, a great score, real scares.Anyone bashing this movie must be on the same page as the invisible man: narcissistic sociopaths who hate how this movie plays out."
1283,They did a stalking movie but then they failed to pick the lead woman role properly. She don't look like someone successful and good looking man would stalk. 'You' from netflix is more believable because the girl is someone everybody will stalk.
1284,THIS WAS A VERY INTERESTING TAKE ON THE ORIGINAL MOVIE... I HAVE TO SAY... THEY DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB.
1285,"So many holes it was like Swiss cheese.. Unrealistic scenarios, unrealistic tech, terrible acting.. Completely expected at every turn.."
1286,"Excellent thriller from start to finish. Unsure I bought the ending fully, though. For her to be able to pull that off."
1287,"I feel like this was a B level script. The storyline is a little silly and predictable. I think the only reason this movie is good at all is for Elizabeth Moss' excellent acting, music and cinematography."
1288,Simply put a great suspenseful film. Wicked and creative. Great change of pace from the plethora of failed doll killer films over past decade.
1289,"Elizabeth Moss should be in every movie ever made. Period.I mean, the movie has some flaws but lizzie moss steals the freaking movie, she and everybody in the cast is perfect. The plot was interesting and very well executed, the directing and dialogue was great and is a must watch from 2020 and by far is the best movie of the year (yet)."
1290,"Ghost movies are scary because we can't see the source of fear and stalker movies are scary because the source of fear is real. Here the person is very much real and as you might have guessed it, you can't see him and while the premise might seem simplistic, the end product might surprise you. This movie works best if you are able to put yourself in the shoes of Elizabeth Moss and try to imagine how terrifying it would be to be terrorized by a real human being while not being able to tell anyone about it.While it starts of rather well with a number of good stalking sequences that made me scan the entire screen trying to spot the man, the overall feeling towards the end left me unfulfilled. Despite the predictability of the plot, the movie itself is an enjoable experience if you like stalking thrillers as it has solid music and camera work. Moss is great as she is able to capture the paranoia combined with the despair of no one believing her. What I found impressive about the film is how seemingly easy it is to tear down a person's life if one knows which buttons to press."
1291,"This is a very entertaining thriller. However, for those who are seeking to explore the character of The Invisible Man further, as in the original 1933 film, please note that the focus here is the character of The Invisible Man's girlfriend, played very competently by Elisabeth Moss.In the #MeToo and #Timesup era, this is a new, intense and, at times, nerve-shredding look at domestic violence, blended with the sci-fi of The Invisible Man legend. It is a story about the heroine's suffering and how she brings herself to fight back.A number of films that this reminded me of whilst watching it included Sleeping With the Enemy, What Lies Beneath and, to a lesser extent, Joker. There is also a sequence that closely recalls the plight of Virginia Madsen's character in Candyman. Therefore, if you enjoyed any of those films, you are likely to enjoy this one as well.Fans of all the fantastic thrillers made in San Francisco may also enjoy the fleeting glimpses that we receive of the city (although the film was primarily shot in Australia) and admirers of John Carpenter's The Fog will also be pleased to see the town that featured as Antonio Bay making a ""blink and you'll miss it"" appearance towards the climax.However, once again, if you seek insight into the particular psychoses of The Invisible Man, you are best to watch the original Claude Rains film. Otherwise, there are plenty of jump scares and this is a very effectively made psychological thriller that effectively communicates the heroine's plight to the audience. A marked improvement on the Tom Cruise version of The Mummy."
1292,"From Start to finish this movie keeps you captivated. Script, acting and camera work all A++. The suspense is consistent right until the end. Must see!!"
1293,"I really enjoyed the invisible man, it was a different kind of thriller and it works. Elisabeth moss slayed as the leading lady, developing well throughout the film and delivering a killer ending. The acting was good, the storyline development kept a good pace, and the action scenes awesome. Really enjoyable thriller."
1294,A good thrilling movie from start to finish. Elizabeth Moss was excellent as a tortured protagonist... music was a bit much at times but otherwise worth the money to see.
1295,"The production, direction and performances are quite good. The plot is quite clear since the trailer and you know where is going and what to expect, but still managed to surprise and entertain until the end. Although a remake, the adaptation is great."
1296,"Taking a classic horror premise and delivering it with effortless style and striking intensity, The Invisible Man is a gripping and powerfully distressing watch throughout.It features a stellar lead turn from Elisabeth Moss, pitch-perfect direction from Leigh Whannel and clever writing throughout, all of which makes it more than just a horror-thriller, but a genuinely impressive piece of cinema as a whole.There's a lot that's great about this film, but the best place to start has to be with the outstanding central performance by Elisabeth Moss. Having proved her talents on countless occasions in the past, Moss brings a staggering level of depth and intensity to her role, lifting what could have been a run-of-the-mill horror-thriller to being so much more.From the very first frame, Moss brings a palpable sense of unease and distress to the film, as her character desperately escapes from an abusive and controlling husband, only to be just as tormented even away from him.Her performance isn't your average horror turn, shying away from melodramatic screams and shrieks in favour of dark and intense emotional depth throughout. And with that, her character and the film's assessment of her mental state becomes so much more gripping.Because, while there certainly is tension and horror excitement throughout, The Invisible Man stands out because of its emotional intensity and intelligent, modern perspectives on abusive relationships and mental health.With Moss as the centrepiece for its exploration of the extents to which emotional distress can take a person, The Invisible Man strikes up hard-hitting and intensely affecting themes, which in turn lend real gravitas and dramatic depth to its horror thrills.So, even if you're not a horror fan, this film has so much to offer you, from its brilliant lead performance to its intelligent, striking and powerfully intense dramatic themes - a real triumph for what you might at first see as little more than a generic horror.But, if you are a fan of the genre, don't despair, because there is still a lot to enjoy from the thrillseeker's perspective. With sleek and tension-filled directing by Leigh Whannel, The Invisible Man doesn't pull its punches when it comes to intense thrills.Although it does jump the gun a little early when it comes to bringing big, action-packed horror into the fray, the film's dramatic intensity works in tandem with Whannel's eye-catching direction, developing a powerful, almost ruthless brand of horror that's brilliantly tinged with hard-hitting dramatic depth.The film changes and develops brilliantly over the course of its two-hour runtime, but the horror always stays at the centre. Even in its quieter moments, you find yourself looking around the screen to see if the Invisible Man is hiding somewhere in plain sight - evidence of how effective Whannel's directing is.All in all, I absolutely loved The Invisible Man. More than just your average horror, the film takes a brilliant and simple concept and gives it stunning depth, gravitas and intrigue throughout. Bolstered by an amazing lead performance by Elisabeth Moss, it's an entirely gripping watch throughout.And with good action and horror fare to bring pace, intensity and ruthless excitement to the table, the film is just as thrilling as it is enthralling, all brought together by director Leigh Whannel's eye-catching and brilliantly effective style."
1297,"It's quite rare that a remake of a classic film ever reaches the same heights as the original, and even rarer for the updated version to surpass its predecessor. The Invisible Man (2020) is that rare remake. Leigh Whannell's follow up to 2018's Upgrade (a fantastic grind house sci-fi thriller) was always going to be an uphill battle, especially since he chose to adapt a classic novel that was made into one of the most iconic horror films of the 20th century. I personally had high expectations for this movie after seeing what Whannell did on Upgrade, and can thankfully say that he did not disappoint. The Invisible Man is a great movie, not a perfect movie, but damn near close. When judging the film against its apparent goals, it's hard not to tick off all of the boxes: it is legitimately suspenseful and scary, it actually has something deep to say that is thematically woven throughout, and the technical aspects of the film are expertly crafted. I'll address each of these points individually, starting with the horror elements. Whannell is no amateur when it comes to horror, and that is quite apparent in this film. He seems to understand the basic, yet often forgotten concept that is essential to any horror film: the audience must care about the character who is in danger for it to be scary, and you have to slowly ratchet up the tension throughout the scenes so that when the jump scare comes, it feels earned. Whannell wrote Elizabeth Moss' character Cecilia to be incredibly sympathetic, a victim of an abusive relationship who only wants to get her life back, yet he never strayed too far to make her seem helpless. We understand right away that she is smart, determined, and capable, but still vulnerable. This balance is executed perfectly thanks to Whannell's tight writing and Moss' stellar performance. This serves the horror aspects of the film so well, not only because you care when Cecilia is danger, but because since she isn't completely helpless, the audience can intuit that her stalker ex-boyfriend is that much more threatening to make her so unnerved. This movie also suited my taste quite well, in that more time was spent building suspense than throwing jump scares at the audience. When the jump scares do come, it's after the tension has been heightened to a fever-pitch so the resulting scare is amplified and legitimately frightening. Moving onto the deeper theme that motivates the action and horror, again Whannell knocks it out of the park. Abuse, gaslighting, and PTSD are real world problems that the audience can relate to, and Whannell ties them in perfectly with the antagonist of the titular invisible man. The whole idea works as a metaphor just as well as it does as a horror movie: women get tormented physically and psychologically by men in ways that the rest of the world can't see, and often are labeled as crazy because of it. This thematic statement is evident through every twist and turn the plot takes, every scare sequence, and every choice a character makes, and as a result, elevates the movie from good to great. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't gush about the technical mastery that Whannell displays here. After seeing Upgrade, I knew that he had inventive and thrilling ways to stage and shoot action, so I was excited to see what he did in a horror setting. Throughout the film, and particularly in suspenseful scenes, Whannell's takes are long and lingering, often meander away from the subject to show an empty chair, or open doorway, before panning back to Cecilia. This tactic is brilliant because as the camera wanders around a space, seemingly showing nothing at all, the audience is on the edge of their seats, wondering if that empty chair actually has an invisible man sitting in it. This is just one way that Whannell uses the concept to adapt his visual style in a unique and effective way, but there are countless more scattered throughout including the return of the fixed-tracking shot fight scenes that he used so well in Upgrade. The Invisible Man is a meticulously crafted film, with a powerful and relevant message, that never fails to put the audience on edge and then scare the hell out of them. I wouldn't be surprised if in 5 or 10 years, this movie is considered to be one of the modern classics among others such as 28 Days Later, Get Out, and Midsommar. Go see this movie in theaters, it is well worth it."
1298,"Incredibly suspenseful. The smooth yet suggestive camera movement is giving a very convincing terror, because the viewer could trully felt the sense of dread coming from every corner everytime the character enter a new scene. Well done."
1299,"All of us who have watched Hollow Man - early 2000s, this is a recap with a some twists and decent thrill.Story and screenplay are decent, background score is good and overall you would like to be stuck to your seat waiting for What' Next.Am sure, all of us love drama and watching some great shows with storyline, this one is one those lists which you would like to watch because you want to and like to know what happens in the movie.I still believe movie could have created a greater buzz and interests in the audience if they hadn't reveal that there is any Invisible Man, trailer shows Kate Moss throwing paint and revealing the suspense for us. If the movie title could have been something different and team could have been creative to keep us on edge with a suspense, just around Kate Moss being acting crazy and why .. showing actions where she' being thrown into the window and more .. and we would have been left wondering if it' someone real after her or something unexplainable. Currently after watching the trailer I went ahead with Hollow Man rewind and knew there' something sci-fi etc.Even I laughed at my own so called promotional approach but I think, my experience and amazement would have been a lot more if I had found during the movie that it's really her husband in some sci fi suit :DOverall, a decent watch.Possible, new audience who haven't watched Hollow Man will like it and rate 7+ .."
1300,"The seen-it-a-thousand-times deliberateness to the acting and directing, complete with drawn out and pointless ""suspense-based"" camera pans, left me angry at this time-waster. But when the dog magically appeared (I guess it can walk through walls), and was illogically ""set free"" in a wall-enclosed property, I knew this was going to be pure crap."
1301,It kept me on my edge all the way trough!!! Loved it
1302,"Really good! Had me at the edge of my seat the
Entire time! Rarely to come across films like this nowadays! Highly recommend it!!"
1303,"In what is undoubtedly the best film of 2020 to this point, The Invisible Man is a brilliantly directed take on a classic 'monster' story. Sleek, visceral, and at times genuinely scary, the film once again proves that it doesn't take more special effects, green screen, or CGI to improve the quality of a horror film. The use of empty space is remarkably terrifying at times and I was consistently impressed by the story choices that director Leigh Whannell made to make the film entertaining all the way up until its final moments. Quite simply, this is one of the best (and for lack of a better term -coolest-) horror films I've seen in recent years.9.3/10"
1304,Now this is a true horror movie. It was scary from the very start. A must see to all horror movie goers.
1305,"I was freaked out through the entire movie! Amazing actors, I cried twice!"
1306,"Each person acting did an amazing job, especially Elizabeth. The build was slow but worth it. 10/10 recommended."
1307,"Can Elisabeth Moss do any wrong? Not from what I have seen of her, and i have seen much of her film and TV work."
1308,"This is by far one of the more impressive horror/mystery films I've ever seen. The script, editing, and pacing were all great. Elisabeth Moss obviously carries the film - showcasing her outstanding acting prowess yet the others definitely performed well also.I found myself short of breath, or not breathing at all, several times throughout the film. At one point, something so shocking happened that my mouth dropped right open and I audibly gasped in sheer disbelief.This would have been a perfect film if minor details weren't dropped (ie: who was taking care of the dog that entire time)? Overall, a fantastic watch. Highly recommended."
1309,"I don't want to ruin anything for anyone but I'm a certain scene within the movie, watch the plates while two characters are at dinner. The food moves with each switch of the camera from one person to another. I tried to keep this as vague as possible so that it doesn't ruin anything for anyone, but I couldn't take the scene seriously after seeing this happening. Still an awesome movie overall though. Just thought I'd share this to see if anyone else had noticed this."
1310,"We all have had that scary sensation - someone is there. Or are they?This movie does a great job of playing off that fear. Suspenseful, edge-of-your-seat, with a number of ""oh"" moments in the theater.Enjoyed it!!"
1311,The movie was decent overall. Huge plot holes though. Like how did she stab herself in the arm and drag down the vien and then 3 seconds later be running around with no blood and clean arms....
1312,"With the recent letdowns of earlier horror films released this year I was expecting all that much from this most recent horror film from Australian writer/director Leigh Whannell who also helmed 2018's body horror/action thriller ""Upgrade"" and previously the third installment of the Insidious franchise in 2015, however I was quickly proven wrong within the first ten minutes of the film during the dark and incredibly tense sequence when Cecelia Kass (Elizabeth Moss) escapes her torment at the hands of her sociopathic, evil, but brilliant scientist lover Adrian who specializes in optics technology.Even though he physically doesn't actually appear throughout the vast majority of the film, surprisingly he still manages to maintain a sinister presence over just about every scene in the film, illustrated both through his psychological torment over Cecelia who with her wide eyed paranoid stare and somewhat insomniac appearance makes it all the more easier for Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) to both manipulate her as well as her friends and family into distrusting her and causing her to become more isolated and frantic as the film progresses.The entire cast, which also includes Aldis Hodge as her close friend James who is also a cop, Storm Reid who plays his teenage daughter Sydney, and Harriet Dyer as her sister Emily all unanimously turn in great performances and even some smaller bit parts were done quite memorably. I've never read the book or seen the original The Invisible Man from 1933 so I can only judge this film as a standalone effort. However from what little I do know about the source material it appears that Leigh Whannell decided to take a different approach or reimagining of the story as opposed to a direct remake, which in my opinion is how you do proper remakes. Surprised, you bet I am!"

1314,"Ever since Black Christmas remake METOO film i should say, i was looking for another good BlumHouse film and Invisible Man delivers.Leigh Whannell is no doubt, a terrific writer and genius He is the true Saw creator.Elizabeth Moss acting was brilliantly done.Good flick with a nice little twist."
1315,"Well made film that gives it to you early on and spreads out evenly through out the entire film.
Pretty cool cinematography as well."
1316,"Hand down one of the thee best Psychological horror thrillers written and directed by Leigh Whannell who has done a fantastic job in delivering a emotional intense film from the Book by H.G.Wells.First i want to say that this film theme might be a little close to home for some people that have been in abusive relationship it might trigger some bad memory's, though the film doesnt show the abuse you can tell there has been abuse by the amazing and convincing Acting from actress Elisabeth Moss, who through out the whole film brought some of the best acting ive seen in a while.The way she portray a desperate woman trying to escape her abusive husband only to find her self being stalked by something unseen is incredible acting. Its also the way the film is done with the camera work so well done it make you paranoid just watching it. Its the way it doesnt just stick with the characters the camera would pan across the room and stop at a certain point giving the impression that something or someone is in the room, it clever filming because you make you throughout the film watching every corner, corridor and doors making your paranoid which put you in the shoe of Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth).I've gotta say this film is not afraid to go to places where it gets extremely dark and extremely intense, with some Gory as hell scenes with some creepy as hell moments that really set the tone for this film.The visual effects are Spot on as well, so you might be thinking this will be just another Poor execute film but you miss this one your be missing out of a fantasy film that really keeps you on the edge.This is a new take on a classic universal monster that you will not want to miss and it's definitely worthy of going to see in the theater, especial with it psychological tone that will keep you on edge and the dark undertone of the story giving an amazing performance throughout that you will be watch you own home for a while after.Dislikes: There are some part of the film if you go in with logical thinking, that these small parts might be a little disbelieve-able but as a whole the film is good."
1317,"This movie is amazing!
Hereditary vibe in one scene"
1318,Jeez this movie freaking awesome and the story very nice i like this movie and i am recommended üòé
1319,It was surprising a superb movie ... really love to watch it again
1320,"The construction is very well made. I would totally watch again. I watched this movie after watching Joker as my last movie at the movies and well, it was as much as interesting to me. Very well done."
1321,"After staging his own suicide, a scientist uses his power to become invisible to stalk and terrorize his ex-girlfriend, who recently ran away from the abusive relationship they were in. When the police refuse to believe her story, she decides to take matters into her own hands and fight back.This movie was quite bad. I completely disagree with most of the good ratings and reviews critics are giving this film.The plot is the core of a film, if the plot is bad the movie is most likely gonna suck. I didn't have any problem with the story, I thought it was quite a good idea to put a horror spin onto the original and add in the trauma of the main character having experienced abuse from her partner but the film lost this towards the end, it felt like that horrible thing that happened to her for 2 years has just been forgotten about because there's an invisible man and the movie also didn't make us feel sorry for the protagonist and the years of abuse she went through. I feel the movie would've been more effective emotionally if they added some flashbacks or even showed the abuse in present time. It wasn't only the loss of the plot that got to me, there was many potholes, the movie could've been solved at the start (I won't say how because of spoilers) but when that happens in a movie and the character decisions are dumb it makes the 2 hour movie you just watched feel pointless. The ending was super cheesy.With that said, acting was okay but the shots were very effective in rising tension by making the audience feel like were following a subject that we can't see or try doing a dutch angle making it seem as if it was a first person shot of the invisible man peaking.The score, which many people praised, felt way too loud and in your face. It felt as if it wasn't the visual aspect scaring us it was more audio based. Which is understandable because the bad guy is invisible but that's one of the problems of putting a horror spin on something you can't see. It's very difficult.This movie is watchable so go watch it if you want. I think the casual film watcher would enjoy this but I personally disliked this film.Grade: D+"
1322,Didn't now was DC until after seeing the movie.Really bad.2nd part terrible.
1323,"The whole package. I was expecting less more comic bookish, but I got scared a couple times, maybe 3."
1324,Elizabeth moss is the most annoying actress ever. This nonsense movie is a total waste of time. Plot holes everywhere.
1325,"After seeing several 5-6/10 movies the last couple of weeks I have begun to fear that I had lost my passion for movies (this has happened before). But holy crap this changed my mind and really took me by surprise, what a masterpiece. From the first minute till the end it keeps up the suspense and you're emotional invested in Elisabeth Moss character Cecilias fate.Some might think, 10 out of 10, isn't that a little high? I say NO! It kept my interest up for the whole 124 minutes without even once looking away, there are Oscars worthy acting from Elisabeth Moss, that's simply amazing and now after watching the movie it gives me goosebumps just thinking about her performance. So there's not a single thing I would change in the movie. My biggest problem is that I can't wait to see it again! It's equally amazing that the director, Leigh Whannell now in my book have two 10/10 movies in a row (Upgrade was the other one), I think that's a record."
1326,What else more could you want from a movie. Non stop heart pounding! Definitely a must watch even for a $20 rental it was so worth it!
1327,Very tense movie. The storyline is perfect with spectacular ending. I don't want to spoil anything but it will leave you speechless. GO SEE IT!!
1328,"A true masterclass!
I could not find any flaws with this brilliant thriller."
1329,"Kind of interesting story about a psychopathic woman who contrived to murder her loving husband.Think about it. The movie presents NO evidence that Adrian is anything other than a loving husband. When confronted with incontrovertible evidence that her brother-in-law is the one who has been terrorizing her, this mentally ill psychopath then plots to kill her husband.#believewomen? I think not."
1330,"Only thing hard to believe is if the guy was that rich he would have chosen a much more attractive girlfriend rather than the main caracter.Great movie absolutely need to watch, 9/10"
1331,"A friend was determined to see this movie and I was somewhat interested in the revised premise. However, 20 minutes in, I leaned into my friend and whispered ""this was written by a man, she's so unbelievable."" I have just gotten home to look it up (because the name Leigh didn't really tell me) and I am not surprised to see that I am right.I can tell you this is not necessarily a bad thing: not all writing is marred by the author's gender. However, I just felt from the beginning that this writer didn't understand what it is like to live in a society where you are expected to be responsible for how you are treated all the time, the self-blame of it, yet raised to be constantly compassionate. I felt that way immediately when she didn't take the dog with her in the first few minutes of the movie (studies show few women leave without the pet because, if she is subhuman, imagine how he'll treat the non-human, especially if she loves the pet! It is a concern for shelter-planning).Later, it just felt false in that she was too brave. The writer/director didn't understand how it feels to be broken down. Sometimes broken women are the bravest people you'll ever meet, but there are little behaviours and expressions that leak out to show how the bravery is forced (this is likely a combined issue with script, directing and portrayal work, but even one can throw off the others).There were just a whole bunch of tiny things that broke the fourth wall for me, where I thought ""wait a minute"" and had lost my suspension of disbelief. By the climax, I was mentally critiquing the special effects rather than lost in the tension of the moment. I wish I could get my money back or, better yet, a chance to revise some of these characters. She was not redeemed in my eyes, nor a hero in her survival."
1332,To be honest this was a LOT of fun. There are many scenes in this film that surprise you and even the ones that do not are so much fun for a thriller.Is the movie predictable - oh YES! Is the ending anything special - NOOO! That is actually what ruined it for me. It was Hollywood trying to make another political point. I am getting tired of this bull.But regardless the cast was great and the specific scenes where they try to thrill you - worked.Ok job overall.
1333,"When I was kid, I would occasionally fantasize about being invincible. I got hours of fun just thinking about the possibilities. What I never fantasize about, was being invisible and using it as a tool to terrorize my ex. Avoid this pile of steaming ..."
1334,"It's not the worse movie that I've seen, but it's not the best either. I've read most of the spoilers that came to my mind while watching (i'll admit that I'm late as far as viewing this movies it's Dec 2020), however, there are a few that aren't mentioned or at least I didn't come across them.(1) Who found Adrian's body and did the police show up to his house? i would assume that Tom's DNA would have been used to verify Adrian's identity if the ME or police couldn't without fingerprints on file, or dental records.(2) Why would Cee's plan include dressing downstairs after escaping the bedroom? Couldn't she have dressed once she safely made it OUT of the house?(3) Why would her sister put the car in park to ask questions when she's driven in the middle of the night to pick up Cee? Wouldn't waiting until they were at an IHOP or Denny's or anywhere where it would have been safe to ask questions been better?(4) How did Adrian gain his wits so quickly after consuming the doage of pills that he'd been given? How did he not know that Cee was in the house tied up by robbers or behind the house nude because someone intended to break in, but was clumsy enough to hit his car and set off the alarm? He automatically knew what was going on after waking up and gave chase through the woods...(5) After Cee knew for a fact that Adrian was stalking her - why did she endagner James and Sydney by staying in their home? After all, they were kind enough to take her in and try to keep her safe.(6) Was Tom on the plan from the start? This was never explained. One could say that he wasn't because he stated that he hated Adrian and was glad that he died, or was he only complict after he found out Adrain was really alive and feared for his life?(7) How could Tom have stored Adrian in a basement and he lived 2 weeks without food or water? If one were to believe the story that Adrian tried to use to pin everything on Tom. Were the police that stupid?I'm not going to address the other plot holes/questions because they have been brought up quite frequently. However, some obviously did not pay attention to the movie. The fire extinguisher was used to put out the fire during the cooking fiasco. Cee said that she would never have peace unless Adrian was completely out of the picture. Would could James have done at the end other than what he did? He knew Cee was a victim, was pregnant, had the invisible suit plus access to Adrian's millions. He didn't have much to work with, did he? After all, there was footage of Adrian slicing his own throat."
1335,"It's watchable but that's all. Don't think about it too much - have it on in the background, too many plot holes and no character development."
1336,"This is a great movie that only really works because of one person. ELIZABETH MOSS. She carries this movie and she is amazing in it. The rest of the cast is great too but she is amazing. It portrays a toxic and abusive relationship very well and Moss gets across the pain she went through without us even seeing it. The Invisible Suit thing can be slightly cheesy, but it doesn't hurt the message of the movie. It is very well made. The production design is amazing and the action is pretty intense as well. It does raise a lot of questions, but I think its a good thing.Check it out. I really like this movie."
1337,"Elisabeth Moss is incredible!!! In my opinion she is the reason why this movie is so good. One of the best horror/ remakes / reboots of all time. If you have not seen this please do oh, it's absolutely a breath of fresh air (that you can't see LOL)!"
1338,"Conquanto seja realmente pavoroso um ""stalker"" na vida de qualquer pessoa, esse filme √© bastante mal feito. O roteiro √© sofr√≠vel e tamb√©m os efeitos. O final √© bacaninha, mas s√≥. While a stalker in anyone's life is really dreadful, this film is quite poorly made. The script is poor and so are the effects. The ending is nice, but that's it.#movieslover #telecine"
1339,"Heat sensitivity cameras, motion sensing alarms, freeze spray, plush rugs...all easy to get these days,...no, just play that everyone thinks she is deranged. Utter, utter drivel. Gave up after 30 minutes, 29 too long."
1340,"Is this a thriller? Horror? Drama? I liked it but trying to figure out if I was meant to be scared, or intrigued...Started off strong and then confused me with what was happening and meant to be happening."
1341,Perfect way to muck up an excellent original. So disappointing
1342,"472 brainless decisions later, the movie finally ended. I understand characters in horror movies make choices that the audience members wouldn't make, that is part of the fun... but are you kidding?! This was ridiculous.
I guess kudos that the female lead got to save the day in sneakers and not high heels. That got the 1 star review.
Would not watch again. Ever."
1343,"I have to say i enjoyed the movie. But the producer and director did not get the casting right. I mean come on. Elisabeth Moss may be pretty to some but not to me. You need to have a pretty and hot girl to play this role. What would make a man jealous to the point where he will not leave you alone even after he is dead. Certainly not an average looking woman. I am not sexist. Its just facts and logic. The woman has to be smoking hot that he wants you all to himself.
So that bit just just didn't work for me.
Go watch it. It is enjoyable but could have been a lot better!"
1344,"I haven't rated a film 1 for a long time now. None other film deserves this more than this one here. There's 0 acting, the conversations are ridiculous and the plot is just horrible. The first few minutes were compelling, it went downhills from then on."
1345,"Elisabeth Moss is great in this athmosperic nailbiter of a thriller. Nice to see a ""normal"" looking heroine with ""flawed"" skin who acts like a normal woman would under these weird circumstances. Reminded me a little of ""Sleeping With the Enemy"", but was even better, with more twists and scarier scenes. The cinematography and music score was very effective and underlined Moss' emotions. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie. Bravo!"
1346,"The Invisible Man has a pretty interesting concept, although at times this concept seems like a one trick pony placing a little too much importance on jump scares (although not too much I must say). I thought for the most part though the plot was pretty well executed and full of suspense. It was very enjoyable and never got boring, but it was fairly predictable in parts and never reached a booming crescendo. Saying that though there were some shocking surprises thrown in too for good measure. So overall a decent and thrilling ride.As I mentioned there was a little reliance on jump scares, but the fact that the plot revolved around an 'invisible man' meant that this was inevitable to some extent. What I thought the film did really was to create a constant sense of suspense and unpredictability. This lead to some truly remarkable set pieces, with some fantastic effects, which felt very original.I thought Elizabeth Moss was great, conveying the emotional breakdown and transformation of her character very well. She's very watchable in these sorts of full on roles, and she was easily the best part of the film for me. The supporting cast weren't amazing, but weren't bad either.I think overall The Invisible Man is a perfectly decent film, a pretty good horror film, and definitely worth watching. Full of atmosphere, full of suspense, and despite never being truly scary, is very entertaining at least!"
1347,"When I watched the trailer for this film I was unsure, but after watching it I can say it was amazing, throughly the film I couldn't tell If the woman was crazy or If she was being hunted by her husband. Such a thrill to watch left me on the edge of my seat. Would highly recommend this film."
1348,From the moment it started I was gripped. Talk about edge of your seat stuff!Elizabeth Moss can do no wrong in my eyes.......She's the bomb and boy does she deliver in this movieA great reimagining of an old classic for the 21st century
1349,"I was offended by this movie. I did not like the acting cast or the characters, for the ugliness of the characters in the script and when I looked for prettiness in the acting cast there was nothing pretty to look at. I highly did not like the psychological slavery horror. I highly liked Antebellum, Bloody Hell and the Net Flix AI movie. This is a very artistically gotesque movie in a psychological manner, I also did not like the portrayal of Science Fiction technology that deviated from the traditional stereotype. This is why I was offended. I also hate Downers use."
1350,"I'm keeping my reviews very simple for your benefit. If you vaguely think you'll like this movie, you will. Don't read further reviews. I highly recommend you dive straight into it."
1351,"Well I had no idea what to expect, usually like some idea of what's going to happen, so glad I didn't. Really has you on the edge of your seat, no idea what's going to happen next, full of twists and turns. Has you rooting for the heroine (Elizabeth Moss superb), but you're never sure what will come of her. I think it was really original, didn't read any negative reviews and can't see why there should be unless you're very picky. Great thriller at the end of the day, wouldn't describe it as sci but but simply a thriller. Very satisfactory ending. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Very stylish too."
1352,"They ramp up suspense action scenes and when it gets unbelievable, they just cut and skip ahead. Happens like 3 times. Really bad writing."
1353,"This film is meant to be a slow burner! I think the pilot light went out.
No back story, sorry no story!How is this getting such good reviews.No scares, no chills, so boring!"
1354,"Has no resemblance to original story ,very week story line basically rubbish"
1355,Plot holes and stupidity galore.I'm all for suspending disbelief but this film was just plain bad. So many scenes make no sense from a logical or common sense perspective.The whole scene in the Psych ward would have been caught on cameras multiple times and they are cleary in frame in several shots.I wanted to like it and enjoy it as a fan of Hollow Man and the original Invisible Man series but this was just bad.
1356,"Has some serious logical flaws in regard to its optics tech: Powering issues, cleaning issues, weight issues and damage from external factors & mobility issues. Not to mention size problems, since such a suit wouldn't be easily wearable. Apart from the previous - that is, it's still not easily implementable, the rest is pretty good: Good cinematography, scenery and decent acting, with rising tension throughout . But centering the entire script on just this cloaking device/method and how 2 narcissistic psychopaths can use it to confuse and evade others and turn everyone's life into a crazy nightmare is a bit over-plethoric and somewhat tiring. Similar to exhonerating every psychopath's dream: To use invisibility like that and do what he wants and escape unnoticed, since nobody's seen nothing or turn the blame elsewhere from lack of visual evidence. Gore is decent and the story allows for a gradual understanding of how two narcissist genius psychopaths work and think. If you haven't seen it it's a plus, although it spends too much time playing hide and seek with someone who makes absolutely no other noises? and infiltrates any space available? (-2). The ending was good, although fairly predictable: Dealing with a syzygy of psychopaths, you'd assume the worst: BOTH would be involved AND alive. Overall, a novel idea (combining sci.fi with horror), so it's worth a watch. See Predator (1987) - or any movie in the Predator vs Alien franchise, after you watch this, for a more (scientifically) informed take on the same optics effect."
1357,"I went into this movie with pretty high expectations considering the high Rotten Tomatoes score it received. While the movie is enjoyable and entertaining, I was ultimately disappointed by the end. Without giving anything away, I'll just say that I think there is so much more they could've done with this premise. It could've been so clever and unique. Instead, they settled for pretty much exactly what you would expect, and somehow stretched it to make it last two hours. Most people here are complaining about the logic issues, but honestly that didn't bother me. I would recommend watching, but manage your expectations."
1358,Elisabeth Moss elevates every minute of this film with her fantastic performance as a mild mannered victim of an abusive and controlling husband who believes he faked his death and is using some sort of scientific or supernatural process to torment her. She does a marvelous job of keeping us wondering if she's truly lost her marbles or is experiencing these things for real and writer/director Leigh Whannel has fashioned a smart and feminist take on this classic story that's easily worthy of your time.
1359,"An excellent adaption of the Universal classic: wholly original, modernized, and thrilling, building off writer/director Leigh Whannell's fantastic science fiction debut Upgrade."
1360,Excellent thriller and fairly good acting. A nice surprise ending -- for once!
1361,"Watching a film for a change rather than the rubbish dramas airing in the UK, I have to say that despite the negative reviews I enjoyed this intense psychological Sci-Fi thriller.
Elizabeth Moss was in practically every scene and we shared in her anxiety throughout.
Ok, there were plenty of plot holes and logic anomalies, but it is science fiction.
I think the film is weighed down by the title and the expectation of the reworking of the H G Well original novel of the same name."
1362,"To reboot or remake a classic and being this a Universal Monster movie there are high hopes that are usually let down, which in nearly all times is the case. I find myself feeling that this movie was perfect for the time. Invisible Man made sense being done now. Here Elisabeth Moss does a fantastic job. I loved how the story develops around the concept of controlling a human being even during death. It made parts to feel uneasy. Plus the power her ex has with the technology to control her without being in sight was great. I did love this movie."
1363,"Ignore the naysayers. Especially the ones who whine about plot holes and character development. This is one tight little horror flick, where every shot held longer than expected, made me feel uneasy. A few breathtaking jump scares, and a nice, satisfying twist at the end. This is the best horror movie I've seen this year. Writer/director Leigh Wannell is a genius!"
1364,With the pandemic I think studios released the movies they were not in love with and are still holding on to their best movies for later this year or the beginning of next year. There was an abundance to stream but The Invisible Man was one of the few movies I thought was actually good.Elisabeth Moss had an excellent performance. Really making me feel the horror of the situations she was in. The concept was nice. It was executed well with some terrifying scenes. Not just seeing the horror but making you imagine the horror. There were some by the book scenes but the creators also did create some memorable unique scenes. Worth the watch
1365,"A few shocking moments which is good! Not a bad movie but just some silly moments and plot holes, but I usually expect those from a thriller."
1366,"Another big budget Hollywood thriller about a genius, and adapted for the screen by a moron. This movie is so stupid that it's funny as all hell. It's just so hard to believe that anyone could dream up such crap, and that some people would actually think it's good. It is good, good for a few laughs actually. It was so stupid funny that it reminded me a lot of some of the 1980's campy horror films. Those films were trying to be campy however, where it's quite clear this film is not trying to be. Which makes it even that much more funny. The 1933 version of The Invisible Man based on the same H.G. Wells novel this film is based off, actually happens to be one of my all time favorite films. That's honestly the best thing this 2020 film can do for the world, be an advertisement/reminder for the old classic masterpiece that the James Whale version truly is. Do yourself a favor and watch that baby! Now there's one of the all time great Sci-Fi films of any era. It's an amazing film. This 2020 film, well I pretty much recommend one watch just for the laughs. I'm giving it a 4. For the record I did enjoy this more than that bananas Tenet film. I'm giving that mess a 3/10. Nolan can't even tell an interesting, nor relevant story anymore. The 1933 version of The Invisible Man is an easy 9/10 for me. There, now I probably criticized enough things for everyone to give this review a thumbs down. :)4/10"
1367,"Look, I knew not to expect an Academy Award winning movie, but I figured the plot would be a bit more fun. The first 10 minutes of the movie were interesting. The rest was either too predictable, complete nonsense, or left me checking my watch to see how much longer until the end.The whole sister/email plot line was ridiculous. The whole ""house is empty because the owner has been dead for months, yet the dog is still living there"". Really? No security cameras at the restaurant? Come on."
1368,When she returns to the empty house the dog is there.Who was taling care of it and how did her husband survive all that time hidden as a hostage behind a wall for what appeared to be weeks without toilet or food and water.The killing of her husband also left me confused. He clearly did NOT kill himself.
1369,Its just a glorified lifetime movie network movie with way to much hype. I had to fight to pay attention
1370,"The first 5 minutes of ""The Invisible Man"" were so dark, the only thing I could see was the time on the bedside table clock. There seems to be a large group of young directors that feel like making a movie that is too dark to see is very ""artsy"". I have seen this on TV as well, like the final episode of ""Game of Thrones"" and ""The Walking Dead"". Please stop, turn on a few lights."
1371,"There's nothing to see here
You can fast forward from start to end and it wouldn't matter."
1372,Very slow and doesn't pick up. Lots of plot gaps and very predictable all the way through.
1373,"The Invisible Man, being one of the most famous horror stories of all time, is a rather odd movie. It does have some good scares and set pieces, and an especially good scene in a hospital, but it just raises too many questions. It is one of the better Blumhouse horror films out there, but considering I haven't liked any of their movies except for Halloween. There's some good ideas, but by the end it feels mediocre and confusing. It also went on for another 20 minutes after it actually ended. There's odd camera work that doesn't seem to pay off in any way, odd character beats, and the ending message doesn't seem to work in any way whatsoever, at least not to me. There's confusing plot questions that seem to rack your brain and prevent you from enjoying some decent moments. It's got a more clever approach to the Invisible Man than most other adaptations, but it could have been a much better horror movie, with scarier scenes and scenarios. Overall just meh, but points for trying. If it's the kickoff to a new Universal monster franchise, I may be curious to see what they do next."
1374,Excellent movie very well done. Better than hollowman. Story was solid and some parts were very eerie. Not a horror movie but a solid action thriller. Very good graphics and direction. Good blood and a strong kill count with really good acting. I mean what's not to love
1375,"This is good. Elizabeth Moss never ceases to amaze me with how good she is.Cecilia leaves her abusive husband in the middle of the night. A few weeks of looking over her shoulder and barely making it ouside her friends house (whom she is staying with), she learns he has taken his own life due to the sadness of her absence. She finally feels like she is free from the terror of her husband. Then,,, strange things start happening. Almost like she's being,,, watched?So,,, just watch it already!!"
1376,"Great remake, I enjoyed it. Would recommend. Hard to make an old movie better"
1377,"First of all, Elizabeth Moss is absolutely brilliant in this film. She perfectly captures the fear and paranoia of her character and her performance is definitely one of the most memorable of the year. Second, this film has some intense and downright brilliantly directed scenes.While I enjoyed this movie very much, the ending was a little sloppy to me. At the end of the movie, she gets her revenge on Adrian(The Invisible Man) by using the invisible suit she hid earlier in the movie to kill him, but there is a huge plot point that happened earlier that revealed Adrian knew where her hiding place was. Wouldn't he know she hid the suit there? Did he not notice one of his suits were missing? I don't like nitpicking movies, but I was left a little puzzled. Also, the ending would've been more horrifying if Adrian got away with it and the movie hinted at the fact that he might continue to haunt her.It's extremely frustrating when a great movie doesn't stick the landing, but overall I thought The Invisible Man was well made and an intense experience."
1378,"Great watch, will watch again, and do recommend.This really is a ""what if"" they extended the scenes from ""Hollow Man"" where Kevin Bacon gets into the public and starts messing with people.I am starting to worry about Elisabeth Moss though, she seems to be type-casting into all these heavy handed dramatic roles, or maybe that's just how she acts. She's certainly good enough to pull it off, so it's not a downside of the movie, it's just part of a note that this movie is very much a slow-burn suspense. On the premise alone, the first 2 acts are going to be that way as it is established that she is / isn't crazy and there is an invisible man stalking and sabotaging her.My biggest problem with the movie is that there has never been a more plausible and clearly reasoned explanation for the events, to include camera footage and dead bodies, than she has in this story. If someone finalized a version of a wearable inviso-suit, then this is exactly the type of nonsense they're going to get up to, especially if no one knows about it.It is a little irritating how they handle him once he's been exposed as well. Mostly it's because of the premise that no one believes her, but you'd think people had seen a ghost movie, or would have a clever idea.If the movie sounds good to you at all, then I really think you'll enjoy it."
1379,"When I saw the trailer for this movie I had mixed emotions. The first half seemed like an effective psychological thriller about an emotionally and physically abusive partner. Then the second half turned into a silly action film with the hallway scene giving me flashbacks to Luc Besson's Lucy. It just felt like two completely different movies. And I was getting preemptive disappointment that the cold, methodical and tense horror that I saw in the first half would not be fully realized by the end of the movie. Now that I've actually seen it, I still feel that is the case.The first hour to hour and a half is brilliant. Elizabeth Moss's character is smart and likable which makes her torment genuinely frustrating. I had to root for her to escape the abuse. Shots are lit in subtle yet effective ways. My favorite was a scene in an attic lit entirely by the flashlight of a phone, or at least it appears that way. Often in dark settings it's difficult for filmmaker's to balance realistic lighting with communicating everything they want the audience to see. A phone flashlight is such a simple solution but it keeps from breaking immersion and visual communication in a way that I really appreciated. And there are decisions like this one littered throughout the film which make it a creative and thoughtful ride.For me the movie becomes irritating about 45 or 30 minutes before the end. Without spoiling too much, there's a scene where the main character is framed for a crime by her invisible abuser in the middle of a restaurant. It was shocking enough to make me gasp, but once that initial surprise wore off I couldn't help but wonder ""wouldn't a fancy restaurant like that have cameras? Police would want to see the footage right? Then she would be cleared of any wrongdoing."" But no. People still think she's crazy and she is blamed for the crime.I'm not one to usually pick apart plot and complain about it over the filmmaking, but in this case it did interfere with my ability to really enjoy where the story was going. I'm already sympathetic to the main character's struggles so the movie skipping over what seems to be a clear win for her is unfairly frustrating for me as a viewer. This frustration continues when we get to the fight scene in the hallway that was shown in the trailer. It's about as silly as it looked in my opinion. This is especially annoying though since I was enjoying a majority of the film so much. The whole scene is filled with conveniences and plot armor for the antagonist. I couldn't help but roll my eyes at several moments.Despite all of this, I would still recommend The Invisible Man. The overrall product may not live up to the ground work laid out by the beginning, but it is an intelligent and suspenseful movie. It also tells the story of a distrusting and broken victim of abuse without falling into any cliche traps. She doesn't lose all self sufficiency, but she still needs time and care before she's ready to be her own person again. And that's the core of the story. A woman torn down again and again reclaims her life from a genius abuser with power and connections. I can get behind that."
1380,"Great acting, keeps you on the edge of your seat, but it has been done before. Some great twists though."
1381,"In this movie, the main character Cecilla Kass, who is played by Elisabeth moss, is in an abusive relationship with Adrian Griffen. Griffen commits suicide after Kass's escape and leaves her 5 million dollars. Throughout the film she is terrorized by an invisible figure who is later revealed to be both Griffen and his brother in an invisibility suit. After this is revealed Kass uses the suit to fake her abusers' suicide.
The theme of the film is a classic battle between good vs. evil. This can be seen in the first scene in the move when Kass makes her daring escape from the abusive Griffen. Throughout the film she battles with the thought that her abuser is still alive and trying to convince others of the reality that griffen is not really dead while struggling with her own mental health. This can be seen when kass is committed to the hospital as a result of everyone around her believing that she is indeed insane, unable to cope with the torture that she endured under Griffen.
The film does a good job portraying the villain as present and unable to be seen. In the scene where Griffen attacks Sydney Lanier, the daughter of James Lanier, it is made to look as though Kass hit Sydney. James was letting Kass stay with him and his daughter at the time, and Kass and Sydney had up to this point created a strong bond. This is a key point in the film as everyone around her starts to turn on her and question her mental stability. Also, when griffen uses Kass's phone in order to drive a wedge between her sister, the film does an excellent job of using context and subtle actions in order to alienate Kass from the people that she loves.
Using good lighting and sound techniques the film does a good job of revealing the villain's presence, while at the same time concealing his character."
1382,"As you can see from other reviews, this is a marmite movie: you either love it or hate it. I fell somewhere in the middle. Like a lot of people I liked the initial premise. Instead of the usual trope of seeing how he becomes the invisible man, we switch sides and come in a few months/years down the line and follow his abused and terrified girlfriend, Cecilia, as she escapes and tries to live a new life being cared for by her sister's friend and his daughter. Cecilia lives with agoraphobia and PTSD until her sister comes to tell her that Adrian, her abusive ex, has killed himself. Excellent. Clever. Different from previous versions. Of course we, the audience, know that he isn't dead because it's called ""The Invisible Man"" not ""How I Hid Until He Died"". I was happy enough with that and content to wade through people thinking she was still struggling and even losing her mind as long as she killed him at the end. However when that ending comes, I was a little disappointed. And I was for one reason: We were presented with what could have been a great bait and switch. Earlier in the film we meet Adrian's brother Tom who is handling Adrian's estate after his suicide. During this meeting he tells her she has been left $5million to be paid over time. There is fine print saying she is to commit no crimes, etc. Later, Cecilia's sister is killed and it is made to look like Cecilia did it. Tom turns up and tells her that as she committed a crime, she is no longer entitled to the money. There is some other stuff but I won't fully spoil it. Fast forward, Cecilia kills the invisible man, only to discover it's Tom. Does the movie end here with a ""Haha, you thought you knew what was coming. Yes, Adrian was a ba$¬•@¬£d but he had killed himself after all."" ? No. As we are trying to make a social comment we have to swing back to ""Adrian was a ba$¬•@¬£D and now she has to kill him"". For me, and probably just me, the movie would have been better for the twist as it would have subverted my expectations. Tom did actually have something to gain from harassing her, killing her sister and making her look crazy. He would have got the money back and revenge for his brother's death. It fit nicely. It's still a well done film, and if that hadn't happened I wouldn't have felt I missed out.
But it makes me wish they had. See it and decide for yourself."
1383,"The notion that, less is more, is naturally well suited to the tale of an invisible man. Whether due to budgetary or technical restrains the concept can be effectively used to advantage. In the original 1933 film with Claude Rains full advantage is taken of the concept of invisibility to have a hat or a pipe move without visible support and thereby help create a creepiness. That sudden movement in the corner of the room, the confusion as to whether something has been moved are all unnerving elements that will unsettle. This is replicated to some extent in the new film but things soon become more blatant and the tone changes. Indeed for much of the first third we are presented with a physiological thriller and what appears to be a serious tale of domestic abuse as Elisabeth Moss escapes her domineering but very rich husband, who, as it happens and unbeknownst to her, dabbles in the art of optics, that's, becoming invisible, to you and me. In Paul Verhoeven's The Hollow Man (2000) the idea of invisibility was logically constructed and then carried to its logical conclusion as a wild and horrific ride into sex, violence and gore, following the notion that once that old beast in man is unleashed there is no stopping him. Whereas the new film takes us along the ride as victim and fair enough it is not a pleasant trip. We appreciate the full extent of the horror and degradation caused by the sadistic manipulations and violent acts of the abuser but then, just when perhaps we were beginning to imagine the invisible might remain invisible, the film changes gear and becomes fairly exciting. Not sure about the ending and not particularly happy with the structure and balance of the movie but Moss does well enough and at least a fresh approach has been tried."
1384,"I'm halfway in the movie, but I'm thinking of one thing midway through.... when she goes back... WHY IS THE DOG STILL THERE? Like, the dude died. Wouldn't someone have taken the dog? Super sus. I'd be like ""someone's in cahoots"", or it just shouldn't been taken out. Guess I'll find out.Updaet: I knew there was something fishy."
1385,"It is a a good movie, but not big deal, just normal, I waited more surprises or suspense for the final"
1386,A simple premise but a fantastically gripping story. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.
1387,"Leigh Whannell takes what could had been a laughably trashy redux of Hollow Man and instead crafts an excellent horror movie.When a frightened Cecilia (Moss) leaves her abusive and wealthy boyfriend (Jackson-Cohen), she's terrified about reprisals from him. But instead she receives word he committed suicide which should comfort her. Unfortunately, Cecilia begins to notice strange things when by herself.Much of the movie is resting on Elisabeth Moss' shoulders as the tormented Cecilia seeking escape from a dark past. And she is great. The psychological anguish and dread that Moss conveys is gut-wrenching at times. The underrated Aldis Hodge has a supporting role as her faithful friend. Oliver Jackson-Cohen (The Haunting of Hill House) is literally not onscreen much but he's an intimidating presence.Whannell's direction is cool and confident. Some may consider the movie a tad too long but I thought it was effective at building the suspense and dread. It's a wonder how good this movie is when it could had easily been so stupid and pointless."
1388,"2020's The Invisible Man is an excellent attempt by Universal to revive its Universal Monsters after less than ideal attempts with Dracula Untold and the Tom Cruise The Mummy. The movie re-imagines the Invisible Man as a stalker thriller as Cecilia Kass(Elisabeth Moss) flees an abusive relationship from wealth optics engineer Adrian Griffin with the help of her sister and friends and is only able to move on with her life after his apparent suicide, but Cecilia soon finds her life under assault by strange and inexplicable happenings.Cecilia makes for a very sympathetic protagonist with her arc involving the lingering trauma of surviving an abusive relationship serving as a great source of audience empathy and fear. Where the 1930s film was a much grander film in scale where Griffin's ambitions were about proving his superiority to those in power, here Griffin has a much more reduced presence in the story often times as invisible to the audience as to our protagonist.The downplayed presence of the Invisible Man means the movie plays more with the psychological aspects of the story than the special effects(though those do still come into play). The movie lacks the macabre humor the the 1930s classic, but considering the type of story the movie wants to tell it makes up for this in ways involving character and unease. The Invisible Man is well worth the praise that has been heaped upon it and makes one optimistic about the possibilities that await other Universal Monsters in the modern era."
1389,"Personally, I was quite underwhelmed by the original Invisible Man movie. It's kind of quaint for its time, but the story isn't all that interesting. So I was fascinated to see such a wonderful fresh take on the idea. This movie holds up as a great suspense thriller, with such a simple concept. It's clear that Leigh Whannell knows how to manipulate the audience to have us holding our breath and sitting on the edge of our seats. There are a number of great quiet and still moments in this movie where I found myself searching every inch of the frame waiting for something to move. Whannell truly puts us in the mind of the victim. I also appreciate what this film is doing with the allegory about the real-life abuse of women. It's such a smart way to address our culture's struggle with believing women without making a movie that is overtly about the Me-Too movement. I wouldn't say the way The Invisible Man addresses those themes is subtle, but it fits perfectly with the plot of the film, so I appreciated every minute of it. Elisabeth Moss does a marvelous job of playing that constant fear, and when she starts to turn a corner and begins to fight back it feels like a realistic character progression, rather than an unlikely personality shift.I like that the film doesn't take much time to address the mechanics of The Invisible Man, since the science is ridiculous. However, there were times when I couldn't stop myself from thinking about the logic problems this all creates. I start to wonder about how someone sees and breathes when invisible, and many more little nitpicky problems about the technology. Likewise, this movie uses one of my pet peeves, where we see a bad guy caught/killed and then every other legal issue for our hero magically goes away. Thankfully, the film doesn't slow down much to let me contemplate any of that nonsense. It's an intense thrill-ride from beginning to end. It's also worth mentioning how well they handled the effects in the film. I don't know if they had a guy in a green bodysuit, but when people were grappling with someone who was invisible, it felt real. The Invisible Man is a great example of what Universal should be doing with their classic monsters. Instead of desperately trying to manufacture some pointless cinematic universe (like they did with The Mummy,) you just make a solid updated version of the story as a standalone film. This is a great example of modern horror, and I'd love to watch more movies like it."
1390,"I dont really know how to rate this, should i rate the cast, the thrilling, or the writer.
One of the best movies I've ever watched.
You'll stay shocked about what's going to happen.
The conflict of the story is great."
1391,"This is all my subjective opinion-Keep your expectations in check and I think you'll have a good time if you've been tempted by any of the promotional material. If you're looking for a tense movie, not a scary one, you might enjoy this. There is some blood.Elizabeth Moss is fantastic in this movie. I really believed that her character was being tormented.This is NOT an adaptation of H.G. Wells' book.Plot-
The movie follows Cecilia (Elizabeth Moss) who has escaped from her abusive husband and is later tormented by the eponymous Invisible Man.I thought that the pacing was fine, but there were some slower moments for me. I never checked my watch though or found my mind wandering to other things.The ending felt rushed, but it wasn't bad, just ok.Cinematography-
Great. There are a couple of scenes at the beginning of the movie that really tease you. Tension is built well.I only remember there being one jump scare.Length-
At two hours it was fine. If the ending had been fleshed out more it could've pushed it a little further.Believability-
I didn't think that stupid decisions were made, and I can't think of any damming plot holes after one viewing.Soundtrack-
Good and I might listen to some of it. I enjoyed the end credits theme.Would I watch it again-
Not anytime soon. I'll have to wait a while (forget things) to really enjoy this again."
1392,"I don't know why people are reviewing this film as a ""rubbish"" or ""waste of time"" movie. But, in fact this movie is very good. I enjoyed it watching.Plot of the movie was an average one but the direction is what makes the movie worth watching.Movie is scary and thrilling throughout.One of the best thriller movies of 2020.Ignore the negative reviews and go watch it. Thank me later."
1393,Wow ! Very good movie: Only the end could be a little better
1394,"It's nothing new or special but I really liked it. I'm a harsh critic usually but this one wasn't bad. Had some good twists and turns, good cinematography and music. Plot was like any other horror movie. Overall worth a watch for serial horror fans."
1395,"Could the storyline have been a bit more subtle? Yes. Could the characters have a bit more development? Yes. Was I thrilled to the bone? Yes! Purpose of this movie 100% achieved. Great acting, strong female character. Lots to love!"
1396,"Good thriller! And Moss is exceptional in it! Is her husband invisible, or is she just going crazy? Either way, she looks terrible as the movie goes on, and her acting made me feel slightly insane too! Poor gal! I also liked that, at least exteriorly, the movie was set in San Francisco, which I live near, and Stinson Beach, which is in my county! But I guess this was actually shot in Australia. Oh well...
This is one of those make-you-jumpy kind of films, so keep your lights on, and stay out of the attic!"
1397,"This film directed by Leigh Whannell was a surprise.A scientist fakes his own death to torment his former partner by turning invisible. Elizabeth Moss plays Cecilia, a woman tormented by her ex-boyfriend. Taking the element of science fiction, this is a film about the traumas left by the abuses in this case committed by a man towards a woman and how even if the abuser disappears it can still remain in one's mind.The cinematographic techniques and the camera shots that the film uses are forceful to show us in the environment that there is someone who cannot be seen, this drives Cecilia more crazy and nobody believes her. It may be a clear metaphor when a woman is abused and sometimes they don't believe her. And what is sad is that they can be close people who you trusted. She must draw strength from anywhere to fight it with interesting turning points on how to get rid of a scientist who is a genius but who is a controlling psychopath and who is ahead of everything.It is not a perfect film but it is a little different from the others of its genre because of the atmosphere it raises, the suspense and also a good level of acting. I won't say more, it's a good movie."
1398,"In this modern revisit to Universal Picture's classic 1933 film of the same name, director Leigh Whannell updates the original story effectively to suit present day society and mindset. Elisabeth Moss stars as Cecilia Kass, who is in an abusive relationship (Jackson-Cohen plays the boyfriend). After being found dead, Kass' boyfriend is seemingly haunting her, leaving her being presumed mentally insane. When horror films works a plot through thoroughly, it sometimes takes the edge of the film, and the only reliable sources of actual horror sensation are the jump scares. In ""The Invisible Man"" however, an uneasy atmosphere is constant throughout the film that intertwines perfectly with the otherwise well-worked plot, despite sporadic lacks of originality."
1399,I loved the plot bc I never saw it coming. It's a new form of scary+thriller movie. Absolutely worth the time.
1400,"After Universal's dismal remake of The Mummy and having recently watched several weak Blum House productions it was only word of mouth recommendations that made me look forward to watching this latest version. I admire the writers for totally re-imagining the story, here the main player by far is Mr Invisisible's ex-girlfriend very well played by Elisabeth Moss. There are no mad scientist experiments into achieving invisibility but instead the crux of the story is that of an abusive relationship, with the woman being very much the victim. Only her ex is able to fake his own death, then terrorise her without being seen which provides the horror element. The film clocks in at just over 2 hours, some horror fans may get bored at times but I was gripped. The film has a couple of very memorable scenes, the restaurant being one in particular (wow!). The movie was cut in the UK by 3 seconds to gain a 15 certificate, thankfully the disc release is 18 uncut.I hope any further Universal/Blum collaborations will be as good."
1401,"Not the same old formula for invisibility. Well done film listed as a horror, though I felt it more suspense. Casting was great and acting was top shelf. I found the storyline easy to follow and well wrapped up in conclusion. We rented the BR, and watched the cut scenes, I applaude the choices. Filming was great and the pacing and action held you in place. All in all a well done movie."
1402,"This film takes a while to really get going, but once it does, it will have you hooked.
This is a grounded and tense take on the Invisible man, landing itself firmly as a great thriller.
It has quite a few surprises and doesn't end up being as predictable as you may originally think.
Give it a try, you most likely won't be disappointed."
1403,"If I ever make a horror film when I make it into Hollywood, THIS is how I will make it. The Invisible Man features and conforms to many of my film-making styles and I found that very satisfying. Subtlety, silence, a slow pace and a terrifying atmosphere are the most crucial ingredients to horror and the film had plenty of them. One would typically expect a modern remake of a 1930's horror film to be a stinker, but for this one, expectations will be fulfilled, if not exceeded. While it does not exactly break new ground, it does pretty much everything right. One of the most admirable things about this movie is that it's based in science, not fantasy. The Invisible Man is not a mad scientist who drinks a potion, he's an ingenious optics engineering tycoon who creates a suit covered with hundreds of cameras to manipulate light and fool the human eye into thinking he's not there. The inventive modernization of the source material (with a feminist twist) makes the film more compelling and believable, thus more frightening. Elizabeth Moss is perfectly cast as a woman suffering from domestic abuse. She always seems to have the look of trauma, paranoia, and fear on her face. However, one thing that I would have added to the movie was flashbacks of her character's relationship with her boyfriend, especially the beatings. Being my favorite movie of 2020 so far, The Invisible Man earns my highest recommendation and a 9/10."
1404,"Yes the story does have holes in it, some things don't add up but it doesn't detract from the movie whilst watching it.Its a tense watchable thriller.Reminiscent of 70s horror movies this one is a good, jumpy, spine tingler.
Well produced, directed and acted out in a classy top class thriller style.
Its definitely well worth watching just don't think too hard about the little things that don't make sense.
Enjoy."
1405,"""The Invisible Man"" is a 2020 mystery horror film directed by Leigh Whannell starring Elizabeth Moss and Oliver Jackson-Cohen.
‚ö™
All in all, this modern adaptation of the classic H.G. Wells story is a pleasant entry to the genre of the modern horror film and an important film for the franchise in general that delivers some impenetrable, twisted fun. Blumhouse dusted off an old tale that has been forgotten by most and effectively transferred it to the twenty-first century, thus becoming a surprise hit that no one really saw coming. Undoubtedly, the movie wouldn't be as half as terrific without the phenomenal, by paranoia and panic characterized performance of ""The Handmaid's Tale"" superstar Elizabeth Moss whose amazing acting dominates the mainly taciturn scenes that are primarily characterized by the cinematography instead of dialogue, and thus makes the fear become real in the first place. It successfully breathed new air into the franchise and moved away from the renowned, Claude Rains lead feature from the thirties and created something on its own: Bandages, gown and shades made way for a trypophobia causing high-tech suit, and this is only a small detail of the delighting new adaptation that displays an unsettling and distressing atmosphere and poses as a phenomenal start for the relaunch of the Universal Classic Monster franchise that has been attempted many times before."
1406,"After escaping from an abusive husband, Cecilla struggles to move on with her life and feels that the terror might not be over. She thinks her husband has found some way to follow her and terrorize her further.The Invisible Man is anchored by the stellar performance of Elisabeth Moss and the tight script by Leigh Whannell. Together, they're a perfect team, creating a story that moves quickly and supplies more than a few well-executed jolts and shocks to make your jaw hit the floor. If you want to nitpick some of the logistics, you could, but the film doesn't allow the viewer much time to think of these things while it's playing out which helps a lot."
1407,"Unique story, few jump scares here and there and some twists towards the end, but the ending is not satisfying and drags a little."
1408,"Strongly beginning psychological thriller with an outstandingly playing Elisabeth Moss, dynamic camera work and a sound design that remains in your memory, but which increasingly throws logic overboard towards the end.7,0"
1409,"I honestly thought that The Invisible Man was going to be a flop on all levels except for the box office, but The Invisible was a pleasant surprise. The Invisible Man gets so much right, the camerawork, the acting, the cinematography, and the really good CGI with a small budget. And after The Mummy (2017) failing to reboot the Dark Universe, The Invisible Man gives the best opportunity where The Mummy fails.What I like about this remake is that the plot is completely different. Adrian Griffin uses a suit in this outing, which is a more realistic take than the novel. The plot also had a really good execution. The pacing was constantly intense and intriguing. The Invisible Man also has a lack of jumpscares, which is the cancer of the horror genre. Jumpscares ruin the intensity of a scene and movie; and after watching The Invisible Man, Leigh Whannell proves that he knows how to make a horror intense.The camerawork is really good too, the best part in my opinion. It's hard to film nothing and have a direction, but The Invisible Man makes it look easy. Leigh Whannell does a great job at making it seem like there's a presence in the room, and it creates such an intense and creepy atmosphere.Overall, The Invisible Man has a lot of potential to restart the Dark Universe. Almost everyone loves the classic movies, and them being rebooted to modern times would be great. Almost everything in The Invisible Man is perfect, the creepy atmosphere, and camerawork are top notch. And since The Invisible Man was released in 2020, The Invisible Man has a goo chance to be the best movie of the year."
1410,Some parts i was not so happy with but i had a good movie experience and the ending was extremely satisfying. All in all a pretty decent movie
1411,"If you like constant tension, constantly thinking ""what will happen now?"" and plot twists this film is an excellent choice.It's a thriller, not an horror movie, so that's a plus too because it can be watched by anyone except sensitive people (like young kids).Awesome movie!"
1412,"To summarize, a super talented physicist who has virtually discovered the key to invisibility, can attain anything and anybody he wants, is obsessed over a not so special woman who is super manipulative in making anyone believe whatever she wants, as usual, finally putting an end to the psychopathic journey of the man, we know, nothing about in reality but a modulated version of her (or not).What a waste of real talents over a crazy little thing called love! Period"
1413,Most negative reviewers don't understand that a good horror movie doesn't need detailed script... This movie to top notch classy and beautiful in easy ways... Loved it
1414,"Good one time watch if like me the movie shortage caused by covid has you searching for anything you can get your hands on that is at least watchable. It has some plot holes if you look too closely, and I will likely never watch it again, but it was entertaining for what it was. I don't regret my time spent watching it."
1415,"Amazing performance by Elizabeth moss. But what I don't understand about the movie is: does the suit gives him superpowers, he just became powerful after wearing the suit. And how did he convince his brother to wear the suit and go and try to kill somebody? And what is her relationship between the family she's staying with?The ending was badass though."
1416,"There is a 1933 movie based on the story by HG Wells, ""Scientist Jack Griffin was always given the latitude to conduct some of his own lab experiments. His sudden departure, however, has Flora worried about him. Griffin has taken a room at the nearby Inn, hoping to reverse an experiment he conducted on himself that made him invisible. Unfortunately, the drug he used has also warped his mind, making him aggressive and dangerous.""In this modern take the scientist, an expert in optics, is an abusive partner. His home looks out over the crashing Pacific waves of Northern California. His girlfriend is played authentically by Elisabeth Moss as Cecilia Kass. Fed up with is controlling her she slips out of their bed after drugging him and hides away in a different community. However she soon gets a communication via an attorney that he had died and left her a generous inheritance, with a few strings attached.Soon strange things begin to happen, Cecilia suspects he isn't really dead and that via a discovery of invisibility was tormenting her and ruining her life. This is a fictional story, of course, but it is very interesting and entertaining in its own way. The impact of the movie hinges on Moss' performance and she carries it very well.I watched it at home on BluRay, my wife skipped. The soundtrack has some deep, window-rattling bass in it, unless this movie is viewed in a theater or using a home system with a powered subwoofer than much of the impact of the sound track is missed."
1417,"I already thought, this movie is great by the trailer, but it is even better, than expected.It¬¥s not a flat horror movie, it is more a thriller and a very good one. The atmosphere in the whole movie is fantastic and filming technique and acting is just great. So great, it will be terrifying for some people.And the end of the film.... I did not expewct that, is very good and is rounding the whole film.Great work."
1418,"After seeing Justin Dec's abysmally terrible and borderline offensive directorial debut, ""Countdown"" this weekend, I was in much need of a reprieve.Countdown is about an app you download and it tells you when you're going to die. It's an incredibly predictable film with one too many subplots that don't tie together whatsoever. Over- used jump scares that you can see a mile away. And of course there's a priest and Latin literature and rituals and all that stuff we've seen a million times before in movies that were 10 times better than this one. Countdown is also a cheap rip off of the Final Destination films.But what I found most revolting about this film is that it inserted a social commentary on the #MeToo movement and it backfired big time. Our female lead is only strong, courageous and powerful because in the finale scene, we see her flat belly, and supple breasts as she wears a tight black tank top and is pretty much covered in sweat.But no really- it's not about objectification. Mmm hmm. Whatever, Justin Dec.For your next film, take some damn notes from Leigh Whannell. Whose that you say? Why, he's the director of 2020 version of The Invisible Man. You HAVE to see this movie.I don't want to sound arrogant, but I knew this was going to be an excellent film as soon as The first shot popped up on the screen. It was an eerie contemporary mansion perched on a cliff. It was dark and stormy and desolate. But there were strange amber orange lights coming from within the home. That combined with the haunting soundtrack told me that this was going to be a film made by a real artist. And it was.Our lead character, Cecilia, played by Elizabeth Moss, has just left her boyfriend. And we see right away that this is no easy feat. She seeks shelter in the home of an old friend and his young daughter because she fears for her safety.We begin to discover the boyfriend is quite dangerous. And without giving anything away, I can still share the premise of the film (well, because it's the premise and not a spoiler). Cecilia begins to sense she is being stalked by an invisible man. And she is. Cecilia's terror and panic is so real and vivid thanks to Whannell's skilled use of angles and extended camera shots.There's a chilling scene when we see things from Cecilia's perspective when she's all alone at night. We are forced to look at a stove. A door. A portable clothes rack. Everyday objects and vignettes in everyday homes. But we KNOW something is wrong. We KNOW someone is there but we can't see him. And it's not because we see objects fly through the air (that comes later of course). It's because we SENSE a presence. We feel like we're home alone and are certain someone is in the house with us. I can't recall the last time I saw a horror film where what was NOT on the screen frightened me. This was actually a new movie viewing experience for me!!!And my goodness how refreshing to see a horror/thriller with minimal jump scares. But the ones that ARE used are timed perfectly. This is not a film that throws stuff in your face right off the bat so that you're bored by the end and your nerves are shot to hell. No, this film takes it's time. The terror is unleashed slowly, inch by inch. And with each inch we get pulled in closer and closer. This works so well that by the end of the film I was sitting upright in my chair, wide awake and eyes glued to the screen. I didn't think about my little life in the two hours I was sitting there. My mind did not wander. And that's because of pacing, convincing actors, some genuinely scary moments and a really fulfilling ending.Elizabeth Moss does such a great job of slowly descending into madness. And the fact that no one believes her makes her craziness even crazier, and we begin to panic with her. I love that she is not the typical sexy blond leading lady with her breasts always out. In fact, she becomes quite sick looking as the film progresses. Oddly unattractive. But she is a strong and powerful character nevertheless. Her frailty, or her ability to combat her own frailty is what makes her strong. It doesn't have a damn thing to do with sex appeal and I wish ""woke"" movies would give some consideration to that. Elizabeth Moss's performance is a great example of TRUE wokeness (hint: it has everything to do with what you're made of and not what you look like).And thank you Leigh Whannell for including the character of James. It is SO nice to have a black guy in these movies who DOESN'T have to develop a romantic relationship with the leading white lady. And he's not gay. And he's not your stereotypical mocha colored black guy that seems to be in so many bad horror movies. No, this guy is a big, dark black man. And he's a freakin cop and a single father. Not a word is said about his trials as a black man or the issues he faces as a black cop. No discussion on whether his daughter's mother is on drugs or something like that. Whannell refused to make him a typecast puppet. He's just a normal damn person.This film had ALL the ingredients to make the ""white chick fall head over heels for the black guy"" and vice versa. But they left it alone. And voila! What we end up with is an excellent horror/thriller/sci fi film with suspense and scares throughout, characters who behave in believable ways and we like them for it. And don't let me forget about that soundtrack. Especially the number at the very, very end right before the end credits role. Superb.I'm putting The Invisible Man right up there with standouts like Hereditary, Midsommar and Us. Not because it's anything like an Ari Aster or Jordan Peele film. But because it's new and exciting and refreshing, just as those guy's films were when they were released. I'm going to keep my eyes on Leigh Whannell. Looking forward to seeing what he does next."
1419,"Really dark in places, so hard to see, very slow moving, awful script, and comes with the added bonus of some wooden acting in places. 4/10"
1420,"There was a lot to like about this movie (Elizabeth Moss) and the premise was ingenious. But the creators squandered whatever benefits they had going for them. A lot of decisions the main protagonist made were just dumb and didn't make any sense. And there where plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. It was extremely frustrating finding myself yelling at the tv ""what the hell did you do that for?"" or ""why didn't she just... "". You get the drift. One example: Cecelia is laying on the floor of her room in James' house where she's staying, crying, when James' young daughter comes in to comfort her. She sits down on the floor at least 5 feet away from Cecelia. Cecelia sits up and smiles and tries to reassure the girl that she's ok. Earlier on, Cecelia had gifted the girl with $10,000 a month for a year to pay for her college tuition so these two were extremely close. Their conversation and their demeanour towards each other is friendly and comforting. Out of the blue, her invisible husband slaps the girl hard across the face. She screams out in shock and pain and James comes running in to see what's happening. His distraught crying daughter then tells her father, ""She attacked me! Keep her away from me!! Cecelia tries to tell James it wasn't her but he believes his daughter. This is what doesn't make sense. Cecelia was sitting on the floor leaning with her back against her bed at least 5 or 6 feet away from the girl. She wouldn't have been able to reach the girl to slap her from that distance away without moving considerably closer to her but Cecelia never moved from her position. The girl was sitting directly in front of her so would have seen if Cecelia had lunged towards her to slap her. Anyone in that situation would have said, it couldn't have been Cecelia that hit me because she was nowhere near me and never made any move towards me. But no, despite all evidence to the contrary the girl still believes it was Cecelia that hit her. Even though logistically it would have been impossible and the fact that Celelia had no motive nor showed even the slightest trace of aggression towards her. The way the daughter was carrying on was just a massive over reaction and seemed very disingenuous. Another time she finds her husbands' phone in the attic of James' house. He'd left a bunch of his and her stuff up there to taunt her. She checks his phone and finds photos he's taken of Cecelia and the daughter asleep in the bed they're sharing, proving that her husband is still around and up to no good. But does she take the phone to show to James that something fishy is going on? Nope. She leaves his phone in the attic. WTAF??? Another thing... In the scene in the hallway of the mental institution where the invisible man is attacking and killing all the guards while Cecelia looks on helplessly, there would have been CCTV cameras everywhere plus guards overseeing tv monitors of different parts of the hospital, proving that Cecelia had nothing to do with the demise of the guards and yet in the aftermath Cecelia is still under suspicion of perpetrating the attacks! It's just ridiculous. And the amount of times her husband let her get away from him when he had the ability to stop her any time he chose. Another time... in the restaurant, after her sister is killed by the husband by putting a knife in Cecelia's hand and forcing her to cut her sisters' throat, she stands up in the middle of a crowded resturant holding a blood covered butchers knife in her hand in the brandishing position. If she had just unwittingly killed her sister in such a shocking and brutal way she would have screamed and dropped the friggin' knife immediately. Not stand up and hold the knife in the air like she's about to stab someone else. It was just ludicrous. It was if the director wanted the characters to behave a certain way and do certain things just to move the plot along regardless if those actions made absolutely no sense. Overall it was a fairly entertaining movie but very sloppily and lazily put together. A waste of Elizabeth Moss' talent."
1421,"This could have been good. But no caracter-development, weak dialogues, and logical breakdowns ruins it all."
1422,"The movie has no head, no spine, no feet. It just keeps crawling the whole time.
No characters are given any depth.
Some characters are shown to possess super human skills but with no genuineness."
1423,"Thought this movie would have been better than it was. I did read some of the reviews before watching the movie but when my Wife says does he have super human strength or something, I knew she noticed what everyone else did. If you can get past this part of the movie then it is not too bad, maybe a 5 at best. The storyline is ok but has some holes in it. This movie is just a ""one time watch"" and thats it."
1424,Horrible re-make! Very poor and boring. Very weak characters as well.
1425,"I give The Invisible Man a 6/10 for the movie itself. BUT, considering this is categorized into the thriller/horror genre, I am giving it a finalized rating of a 4/10, maybe even lower. I saw the movie trailer from a YouTube ad and was interested to know if it was good or not. Later, I learned that my friend, who absolutely loves movies, loved it. In fact, I asked her what would be her top 3 movies to live with and this was one of them. So, yes, I had high hopes for this film. Now, let's talk about my film experience. I laughed...a lot. A somewhat inappropriate amount for a movie like this. Did I find this movie scary? Not at all. Did I find it thrilling? You guessed it, no. Kudos for the concept, I'll admit, it is interesting. But I expected so much more. And, if you ask me, I would say this movie is more of a comedy than anything close to horror/thriller. This movie really disappointed me. This was truly a waste of time and I would recommend anybody who reads this to find an actual good horror or thriller."
1426,"All the negative reviews i'm seeing about this movie are by men, so do with that information what you will. this movie is scary, relevant, and concise. it was over before i knew it, and all i could think as the credits rolled was that i wanted to watch it again. it looks slick both in terms of set design and effects and the entire vibe of paranoia is palpable. and it sticks the landing--the end is super satisfying and has stuck as one of my favorite endings to a horror movie. great casting, acting, directing. in conclusion, great flick!"
1427,"The theme of the movie is pretty typical. It held my attention, but it's been done."
1428,This movie is a mixture of Predator meets Ghost meets Paranormal Activity.It's just kind of corny.
1429,There is absolutely nothing that I can say that will be good about this movie.
1430,"This movie is a 2 hour plot hole. There are so many logic issues that even my 11 year-old son pointed them out. Yet the writers couldn't. Or chose not to fix them. In the end, the viewer is left with so many questions that the entertainment part becomes worthless. Also, the CGI is quite shite for 2020, let's be honest."
1431,"The acting and directing are good, but they're in service of a B-movie script. It's full of plot holes, weird character choices, and dumb twists. The invisibility suit must also have teleportation powers, because otherwise I have no idea how this man gets around. And the invisible scares sometimes fall into moments of unintentional hilarity: I honestly laughed out loud when the sister's throat is slit and the knife magically ends up in Cecilia's hand. And the double (triple?) twist at the end is just obnoxious.The worst part of the story is that it relies on one of the worst tropes of horror or thrillers: a victim of a conspiracy rambling about their persecution with a wild-eyed intensity rather than acting rationally and calmly, immediately discrediting themselves. Especially with a victim of domestic violence, such a trope is a massive disservice to the character.If you want to see a great movie about invisibility and female abuse, check out The Entity. The effects and direction are just as impressive, and the lead character acts like a sane person."
1432,Why bother telling a story like this in such a predictable way.
1433,"Starts out as a boring move till the middle, than it gets better"
1434,"Like mondmond actually said Moss was unattractive so y would someone pursue her so intensely?? Who says stuff like that? U obviously know nothing about abuse because majority of the time looks have Nothing to do with it.
I rather enjoyed this and the film's topic of invisible scars resulting from abuse was wonderfully represented. Yes there are a few issues with believability; I won't compare this to the original simply because if the abuse angle... Both are very good based on their own merits."
1435,"I didn¬¥t expect much from a movie like this anyway but it was even worse than i thought. The whole movie is so boring, predictable, slow and quiet. I don¬¥t get how it has so high ratings. I wish i had never wasted 2 hours of my life on it."
1436,"Not the worst movie but everyone else besides the main Heroine is stupid.
so much potential but the wrong choices to make the movie longer. the good cop just agrees to cover up homicide when 5 min before he was saying that Adrian character is a victim. The brother is the killer twist is lame 60's horror film. The security officers in the detention facility no one calls the others on there radios, as she runs out there is three dumb dumbs with a wall of screens and no one seen the massacre of like 8 of their fellow workers. No one reviews the footage of the killing of her sister in the restaurant of the knife just appearing in her hand. please stop making these Horrible horrible films thank you"
1437,It falls so flat. This has so much potential but it was so predictable and boring for the last 1/3 of the movie.
1438,"A few years ago Universal studios put in motion a plan to revisit and reinvent their classic horror icons, creating a shared universe of monsters much like the Marvel superhero universe. With the release of their first film, THE MUMMY starring Tom Cruise, that collapsed like a house of cards. Criticized by critics and fans alike and a financial failure, the whole think crumbled. In response with several items in the works they decided to make the films separate and not tied together at all. The first of those to come out was THE INVISIBLE MAN.Released just before the coronavirus pandemic began the film was doing well at the box office before theaters shut down. In response Universal released the film to digital services and sold it as those theaters closed. Now it comes out on disc for those who chose to wait.Elizabeth Moss is Cecilia ""Cee"" Kass, a woman virtually held captive by the person she though was the man of her dreams, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). Instead Adrian controls every aspect of her life. As the film opens Cecilia is in the midst of escaping having set the wheels in motion to do so before hand. Things don't quite go as expected and Adrian nearly catches her as she drives away with her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer).In hiding Cecilia is staying with her friends James (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Still shaken by her ordeal and fearful that Adrian will use his money and power to find her, she finds herself afraid to even walk to the end of the driveway to pick up the mail. Two weeks later her sister shows up with the news that Adrian committed suicide.Meeting with his lawyer brother Tom (Michael Dorman) he informs her that Adrian has included her in his will. He's left behind $5 million dollars to her, as long as she shows she is mentally competent and not convicted of any crimes. She accepts the money, sharing a part of it with Sydney for college and attempts to move on with her life. Until strange things begin happening.The sheets are pulled from her bed while she sleeps. She hears footsteps. Drawings from her portfolio are missing when she goes to a job interview. She collapses during the interview and they discover Diazepam in her system, the same drug she gave Adrian to make him sleep when she escaped. She finds the bottle she used and lost when she escaped on her bathroom sink counter, a bloody fingerprint on it. Is she going mad or is there some way Adrian is still alive and bothering her?Cecilia insists that Adrian is alive but no one believes her. She goes to talk to her sister to find Emily less than receptive since she received an email from her earlier in the day telling her how much she hated and resented her. But Cecilia insists that she never sent the email. She talks to Sydney and they decide on a girl's night but then something strikes Sydney and she leaves in fear of Cecilia.Still in the house alone, Cecilia discovers Adrian's cell phone in the attic. In the middle of trying to find out what's going on she dumps a can of paint on an unseen force on the ladder to the attic, coating Adrian in some sort of suit. Before she can catch him, he makes it to the kitchen where he cleans himself off. As she searches for him the two fight back and forth until he leaves. Will Cecilia be able to make anyone believe her story? Or has this all been something in her mind?The move does a wonderful job with the special effects, a must for a film like this. Both the fighting sequences and popping in and out of view are handled incredibly well. The direction by Leigh Whannell (who along with James Wan created the SAW and INSIDIOUS franchises) is well done and his handling of the actors helps create much of the tension seen here. The actors all turn in some great performances as well, making their characters and their actions believable.Perhaps the only drawback for the film is its length. At just over two hours the film feels like a full 20-30 minutes could have been shaved off the film and it would have moved along at a much better clip. Too many panning shots of empty rooms and travel time feel like padding. Because of these the first half of the film drags. It is the second half that redeems the film.Not necessarily a frightening film the movie does offer a nice dose of tension to keep you watching. I doubt a sequel will be in order but who knows these days. For now if you're looking for a solid mystery with a science fiction twist, you might enjoy a night with the invisible man."
1439,"The Invisible Man is a science fiction novel by H. G. Wells. Originally serialized in Pearson's Weekly in 1897, it was published as a novel the same year. The Invisible Man the title refers to is Griffin, a scientist who has devoted himself to research into optics and invents a way to change a body's refractive index to that of air so that it neither absorbs nor reflects light and thus becomes invisible. Thi film is based on the character created by HG Wells.This is where the similarities end. This is a totally different story from HG well's 1897 novel. Rather a very Hollywood treatment of the concept with a thriller noir genre, Effectivly it works and the film, despite some slow draggy moments at the start , keeps one resonably guessing and at the edge of the seat.Watch it."
1440,"Wow. Could it be more drawn out? No--not without time moving backward. SLOW. TOO SLOW. REALLY TOO SLOW. SOOOOO SLOOOOW. Rant over.The acting was fine given the script, which was poor and defies all logic.Why ALL the running with CONTINUAL looking back (over and over and over) for what? To glimpse the ""invisible"" pursuer? The movie is a true mess.This film could have been more and should have been more. Especially given Leigh Whannell's other works. For instance, even though ""Upgrade"" was not a masterpiece at least the story fit together and was entertaining for bullied men.Here the writing is lacking and caters to bullied women. Truly a disappointment. Suspenseful at times... but nothing more."
1441,One of the best thrillers I ever seen. At the beggining it's kind of predicting the Cecilia's supposition about the killer's true but that doesn't take the element of surprise at most of the movie.
1442,Not cool man! This film was so simplistic that it made me feel like I was watching a babies movie! I felt like the movie was mothering and nurturing me which was totally unnecessary! Don't watch this movie if you're an adult!
1443,"This was very nearly something special. There are things in here, aspects of the story that are really special. The commentary it makes on abusive relationships is poignant and moving.The problem is, it doesn't commit hard enough to that. It tops its hand a little too early, not helped by the trailer that really gives it away. I also would have really appreciated a bit more backstory and character building because there are a few characters here that are all over the place with no explanation as to why.I love the metaphor, the reality doesn't match up though. Moss is pretty solid, as is Hodge. Unfortunately, Jackson-Cohen is absolutely awful to me. He's built up as this controlling, dominating force but when we met him... He's just annoying and sniveling.Still worth a watch, I'm just disappointed by the missed potential."
1444,"I confess to having felt a bit leery when deciding whether to watch this. I wondered how what has become a cinematic trope (i.e. somebody invisible wreaking havoc whether for comedic or dramatic effect) could have any legs even with the benefit of modern CGI. Then I read the reviews.One minute into this movie, I was absolutely hooked. The directing, cinematography, pacing and the relentlessly tense musical score were the elements that helped propel this movie forward. But the absolute genius and raw power of Elisabeth Moss' acting is what left me in awe. She is at the top of her game in this one. I am going to watch The Invisible Man again with a female friend who managed to get out of a relationship with an abusive narcissist a while back with moderate damage to her psyche and sense of self. I will be watching again so that I can relish the nuances that Moss brings to her character.Before this movie, I had regarded Moss as one of several 30-something actors who are capable of delivering their lines competently and reliably, but never regarded her as particularly compelling, not even as a repressed Handmaid. Her role in The Invisible Man tells me that she was simply an actress of iconic talent whose agent had yet to find the right script and director for her. She deserves a Best Actress Academy Award for portraying an abused woman on the apparent edge of madness who is determined not just to survive her relentless stalker but to destroy him.This is drama at its best. Imagine what Julia Roberts' could have been in ""Sleeping With The Enemy"" (Moss was only 8 years old when that movie about spousal abuse and escaping from a stalker came out in 1991), coupled with the very best that Hitchcock could muster and you have some idea of what Moss has done in this movie. Film buffs will appreciate this reference after reflecting on what they have just seen.Moss will certainly be in that $20 million + earner category after this movie, if she wasn't there before."
1445,The titular character would have done better in a city with no rain. Setting it in Seattle for the depressive mood was a nice touch but stretched credulity. I kept waiting for scene of the invisible man sadisticly tickling unwitting strangers but the screenwriter was being sadistic and wrote a darkfarce instead.
1446,"Sorry, I liked it. Good suspense. Of course, there are some simple ways the story bends sometimes. But just let's not spoil them for everyone in your reviews. A thriller more than 2 hrs, would need more than enough suspense and for me, it has. Not too many slasherscenes, not a scare every 30 seconds. This one keeps you waiting and waiting until a twist in the story takes place. Watch it in one go. It's a decent one."
1447,"I enjoyed this movie to a certain extent.
It's actually a pretty good little movie.
Until you start poking holes, and looking at the characters, and then the ending... well, then it starts to unravel.
This movie hits the points of a standard horror/thriller very well. From the music to the downright genius photography.
That being said, they have a major issue of how they are getting there. This movie needs some exposition and a little more backstory of the main antagonist and really, just to what is going on in this world.Then... the daughter. Casting, set dec, and character is key. In real life she was the age she was 'portraying(17)'. However, she gets a college schalorship, but still sleeps in kid pajamas with toys in her room? Sometimes she reacts as if she is 22 and a young adult, other times she is a 12 year old just learning things. Very awkward that they are sleeping together. When she is introduced, you almost think she is 35 and the wife or best friend. You'll understand when you see it. It's off putting.Overall it is worth the rental. Tons of horror tropes including the usual attic scene and the ol' sheets pulled off a sleeping person.Would be a 6 out of 10. But Moss ramps up the pace and emotion. And also, big shout out to Aldis Hodge. He was great.7/10"
1448,"SPOILERS!
Films like this often frustrate me because the protagonist is viewed by the audience and/or other characters as guilty, crazy, etc for the entire duration until the truth finally comes out at the very end. This film brought relief from that in good time however and then got on with the story. If you occasionally like movies that might get you so worked up that you're ready for a fight on behalf of a character, this might be for you. I swear I wanted to take a crow bar to Adrian. Lol Recommend!"
1449,"I did not expect much from The Invisible Man (2020) other than a modern mashup of 1991's Sleeping with the Enemy and the original The Invisible Man film from 1933 as well as the more recent Hollow Man franchise kicked off in 2000 with Kevin Bacon. Well, to that end, it did not let me down. However, the Invisible Man was much better than just a modern mix up of the previously mentioned films/genres.For starters, Elisabeth Moss does a great job as the main character, Cecilia Kass--a tortured young woman trying desperately to escape the physical and physiological torture inflicted on her by her deranged and sinister, yet highly intelligent boyfriend, Adrian Griffin. Only to find that Griffin has invented a way to stalk and harass her brutally after she builds up the courage to leave him.Now, we never really get much backstory on Griffin other than he's some type of optics engineer who's very well off. This would usually earn the director and writer, Leigh Whannell, low marks for a lack of character development, but in this case, I think it works better for the plot that Griffin is a (mostly) mysterious character.Of course, writer Leigh Whannell lifted this character directly from the book The Invisible Man written by H. G. Wells all the way back in 1897. (Adrian Griffin was also the man behind the invisible cloak in the original The Invisible Man film from 1933. Of course, Whannell does bring the character into modern times.)Anyway, Moss carries the film and holds the viewers attention throughout. That said, Moss's character would never be mistaken for Miss U.S.A., but this is by design and part of what makes the plot somewhat able to stomach. It's also good to see a lead female character in such a role not be the typical Hollywood hottie for once.The movie itself is very suspenseful and there are a couple of plot twists to keep things interesting. While the first two-thirds of the movie is pretty solid, things get too implausible with the third act. In addition, the score probably was one of the most riveting and befitting of the movie it accompanies that I've heard in a long time. However, while great, the volumn was often deafeningly too high at points, and I'm not sure if this was the fault of the sound mixing of the movie or the theater's sound settings.Without giving away any spoilers, I think the plot twist that occur maybe 10 or so minutes before the actual ending would have been a more fitting end to the movie. I guess Hollywood types just doesn't know when they have a good thing."
1450,"I thought The Invisible Man was amazing. It's a tantalizingly addictive thriller with a modern spin on escaping domestic violence.Adrian. Griffin. Adrian freaking Griffin. The psychopathic character we now all love to hate. This man was so perfectly controlling and manipulative. He enjoyed every moment of terrorizing Cecilia and watching her slowly break apart as he isolated her from everyone.There was only a few little scenes that I didn't find quite believable. If you've watched this movie and you recall the scene in the restaurant than you know what I'm talking about.All in all, I thought this was a great movie to watch and definitely something you should get to while we're all stuck in isolation ourselves."
1451,"Since ""the game"" movie , i think i haven't seen a movie that insults logic like this , the very first scene is the only think maybe that was good in this movie, after that it's extremely boring , no good dialogues , veryyy slow story building and i couldn't resist myself from using my phone cause even if you skip a scene or two or even thee it still wouldn't make any difference cause most scenes are useless to the story , the acting was weak from all actors ,i felt no tension, no connection. the boyfriend's story wasn't clearly revealed , we knew very little about him from what his wife told , the suit was a very stupid idea , wearing a suit who can make you invisible just to torture your wife ? Come on !! And how the hell can he be wherever the wife is ! How can even be in the house and not able to make any sound whatsoever , and the killing omg , that was stupid, when she killed her sister im restaurant that was unrealistic, just try it yourself grab someone else's hand and and try to kill someone with it ! She could only open her palm and the knife would be dropped! But he grab her from the hand make her take the knife and and grab it tightly and hit the other's neck ! That is just not real"
1452,"I've waited for an opportunity to use this line (didn't have to wait long). Geico: ""If you're in a horror movie, you make poor decisions."" What is behind the overwhelming majority of films in which a female needs to make a life saving decision(s) she will not do the obvious and/or will chose poorly. Outside of that the light bending technology to make something disappear is already here (although admittedly only in the most static, lab controlled conditions). Overall, a nice redux of a classic."
1453,"You have your suspense, thrills, shocks, fear and love in this whole film. Amazing storyline and actors. Elisabeth Moss did not disappoint with her great sense of acting! Fabulous !! This film won me over not only due to great storyline and acting but also for the no nudity.
Again, fabulous job on such a great 2020 movie!"
1454,"With an increase talk on domestic violence with Johnny Depp and Melissa Benoist, this movie allows us to see what they face from their eyes.The female lead character talked about how she was controlled and essentially emotionally abused. And beyond that, she was physically abused.One day, she decided to run away from her abusive husband and moved into her friend's house. Later, her husband seemimgly committed suicide and she tried to move on. Did he really die? No. Did she really escape from violence? No.He is back with an invisible suit. He hit her friend's daughter, send an upsetting email to her sister and finally killing her sister. And he made the public think it was the female lead who did it.Unlike the movie's ending, many domestic violence goes unreported. It is clear that abusers like Amber Heard or Blake Jenner are not as bad as the invisible man. But their abuse leave a mark of trauma on the victim. Yes, I am a female and feminist. And yes, I admit that both male and female can be victims of abuse. It is time to take a stand."
1455,Very boring and very predictable film. Don't believe the hype
1456,There are some soft spoilers. Not sure whats with so many negative reviews but this surely was a nice psychological thriller. Sure there are some minor plotholes but nothing of a dampener. Now if you pull up each and every small detail like how the invisible man is traveling and why the dog is living alone at the house I think it would be too much of scrutiny which can be explained by some logic and movies do away with even a lot more.But the ending was fantastic and it was worth a watch.
1457,"I had a really good time with this. The suspense elements and atmosphere are extremely well done. Elisabeth moss is fantastic as usual. She carried this throughout and made me care about her character. She's outstanding at selling fear, confusion, and sadness. I found the direction and editing in this to be incredibly immersive, and quite creative. There's some thrilling action scenes, and some rather starling violence and shocks. All in all, it's an excellent movie, and it really put a fresh spin on a classic.But beware of the extreme violence here if you're sensitive to that sort of thing :)"
1458,"This horror film has you sat at the edge of your seat throughout film from the minute it starts to the very end, this is a film that i would recommend to anyone as they has been able to combine sci-fi with a horror as the boyfriend or brother who wears the invisible suit is used to terrorise the girlfriend as she tries to escape. This is the story-line for the whole film as she is stalked and being framed for acts that she didn't do."
1459,"Once again Elisabeth Moss nailed her role. I think she's perfectly suited for type of oppressing character. That last trick of her really paid off since she had suffered by her husband. Thriller lover will definitely love it I believe. Plot was simple but some thriller, suspense tone made it special. Recommended to watch."
1460,"""One must dismiss the wafting thought that whoever acquires the power of invisibility, using it to torment his escaped girlfriend would be a first priority, only a sadist will do that, and this notion is engraved deeply in our mind as Cecilia fearlessly if lonesomely fights her worst enemy, with those who are close to her cluelessly imperiled. Creepy moments are finely conjured up with discretion, no jump-scare or shrilling sound effect required, special effects are frugally applied to a dazzling chill (an abrupt throat-slitting, or the gravity-defying grappling against an invisible assailant), with a $7 million budget, Whannell is well cut out for economy, and after a faux-closure that goes against our aforementioned engraved notion, a final giving-him-the-taste-of-his-own-medicine coup de th√™√†tre accentuates the damage caused by traumatic bonding and a gaslit woman's vindication, it also, if too readily, can be read as a warning to give pause to anyone who are involved in a relation between an ing√©nue and a seemingly omnipotent control freak.""read the full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
1461,When Cecilia flees from her abusive husband she finds herself victim of an invisible figure! This invisible figure then proceeds to harm her loved ones to the point of killing her sister right in front of her ( in the middle of a restaurant no less) from this point this movie becomes more and more confusing! I really don't recommend it.
1462,"The first 20 minutes is very engaging and builds up a lot of promise. Then things slow down, way down, stumbles along with more low points than high points and finally wrapping up with logical plot holes too great to ignore. Ends up way too long for what it does.Elisabeth Moss seems, in many scenes, as if she has been given direction to walk here, look that way, emote this feeling. She comes across as very acted. Not sure if it is she just doesn't have the acting chops for a movie or if she was put into so many scenes to act completely alone with no other actors to work off of. I understand that is a tough thing for actors. Either way, it ended up looking like she had just finished an acting lesson and was doing the practical portion.Overall, skip this one. Sci-fi horror has to be careful of logical consistencies simple horror doesn't. And this one gave up on that early in the film."
1463,"This movie had every chance in the world of being predictable! At first I was thinking oh yeah...a ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" repeat. But no, I sat on the edge of my seat, startled, and shook, for 2 solid hours! If you like suspense this is an intense AF surprise - one of the best I've seen in years! You will not be sorry!!"
1464,"No spoiler: Very average modern 'thriller/horror' which delivers little if anything in terms of frights and suffers from a very poor execution and screenplay. The lead is lifeless, but then again she's working off dialog which itself was working off a defective script.It's not cheap but it feels cheap, it tries to be something it's not and fails miserably. There's no tension, the thrills are given away in the first 5 minutes of the movie, and quite frankly it's the worst I've seen in weeks. Avoid. 2/10."
1465,"(SPOILERS) On the front page for this film there's an article headlined ""What Makes The Invisible Man Terrifying?"".... Well, that's the problem. It's not terrifying. It's stupid. I love Elizabeth Moss in almost everything she's done, but this is an ineptly written tale that caused me more annoyance than fear. The only suspense is generated by the hackneyed jump scare tactics used in tediously long scenes of Moss navigating the dark corridors of her friend's house. The only thing missing was a cat jumping out of a garbage can,. And if it had taken place in an alley, I am sure they would have used that tired device. Perhaps my annoyance comes from a pet-peeve I have.; I hate stupid characters. I take no issue with the premise or the inevitable, (if not a bit trite) plot point that she will be thought mad and have to eventually prove she's telling the truth. But there she is, in her friends attic with the cell phone of her supposedly dead husband and the thing has pictures on it, of her and the man's daughter asleep in their bed.... and she doesn't even try to call someone with the phone and say ""if I am making this up then how did I get his phone?""... or just send the pictures to her sister and ask ""how could I have taken these?"" I don't know what it is about stuff like that, but for me, when a character turns stupid, it kicks me out of the story and I just spend the rest of the film rooting for the bad guy or I watch something else. But, imo, the real problem is stupid writing. Bold for me to say, since I'm no professional, but it's just dumb. They must have been able to construct a confrontation that doesn't turn Moss' character into a blathering idiot incapable of even a a modicum of rational thought. It's not the premise, or the fact that her invisible adversary gets away with framing her, it's the ease and predictability with which he does it. Because she's written as an idiot."
1466,It's very slow and the story is not very good. Ot even very horrific.
1467,"If you look away from the logic in this movie, this is a nice movie to watch.This is another example of an American movie where characters have an IQ of 70 just to point the film into a different direction. This happens a bit too often throughout the movie."
1468,"Slow burner, but after the gobsmacking restaurant scene it had me second guessing right till the credits. Absolutely brilliant writing because you understand why everyone disbelieves her and you feel so much sympathy."
1469,"In a way I loved it and thought throughout this woman is crazy and we are watching her point of view delusions as a mental patient, which would be brilliant on it self and plausible for the things she endured with her abusive spouse and all that.
Throughout the movie I was like... Is this real, is this for REAL??? and than again It can't be real, can it?
I actually had to go rewatch scene by scene when the very poorly executed ending finally revealed the ""truth"" about the invisible man.I was so frustrated by the fact that the moviemaker seemingly holds me for a fool with how he just ignores ALL the impossibilities (yes I have made up a new word because hey it is allowed isn't it?)I am sure many people like my better half who is not after #thingslogical #evenmovieuniversehasphisicallaws wil be satisfied with the immagination this producers had and the story they tried to sell us... BUT! Yes it is a big but...
For the rest of you prepare to be taken for a fool, get popcorn and laugh out loud when you spot one of those moments where (I am warning you there are alot) you will think you are watching a parody/comedy type of movie which got confused and tried to be a horror/action/mistery movie.
I think 4 is very generous of a score, as I originally gave it a 3, but 7+ score as it has right now? If it marketed itself as a horror parody maybe a 5 and that is pushing it... LAUGHABLE Go watch reviews on Youtube, you will see what I mean.
For one thing is sure: Peoples intelligence will get insulted by watching it. Mass insulted!"
1470,"Outstanding movie! Ignore the numerous 1 star ratings, which are way over-represented in the posted reviews on this site.At the time of my review 91,218 IMDB members have voted on this movie. Arithmetic Mean average and Weighted Average are 7.2. Over 74% of voters have rated it as a 7, 8, 9 or 10. Compare this to the fact that only 1.6% of members have rated it as a 1.Yet it is the shrill voices of the 1.6% who are ranting about illogical plot holes, being slow, boring etc. in the posted reviews.I felt compelled to post this positive review to balance out the hater's reviews.Metacritic rating is 72%. Rottentomatoes rate it as 91%My conclusion is that, like me, the overwhelming majority of IMDB members and movie fans in general think that this is a very good or even great movie. And the reason for this is that it is great entertainment. The cinematography and direction etc. are excellent. Elisabeth Moss's performance is great. The suspense and drama carried me right throughout the movies somewhat long run time.It is a sci-fi, horror, mystery, thriller and ticks all of those boxes.If you want to be entertained and gripped by great suspense and drama then watch this movie, you won't be disappointed.If you are going to nitpick about plot holes and won't let yourself be immersed in some excellent entertainment, then look at something else that will better suit your narrow views.My vote is with the other 5,901 IMDB voters who have rated it as a 10 out of 10. Go see it and get blown away!"
1471,I strongly believe Mr Whanell could ve made a better job with this plot instead of relying on oldfashion tricks. What stroke me the most is that the movie got a 72 metascore!!
1472,"I actually really enjoyed the first ten minutes of this movie and was looking forward to seeing how it developedAnd then it didn't really.Elisabeth Moss did a really good job with the character, she was great to watch. But really, the entire movie is things being moved around by an invisible man and Elisabeth trying to convince people there is an invisible man. That's about it.The real issue in my opinion is that once you know there is an invisible man (before the film started), then things moving on their own isn't particularly interesting, because you know there's just a guy there that you can't see? So, you need a good storyline to carry the film. And there wasn't one.Anyway, it was alright but don't pay for it :)"
1473,Amazing movie.....must watch.....had goosebumps while watching.
1474,"I would probably give the film a 8 or 9 stars, but seeing so many people crying over their disappointment here, led me to give a 10 star. It seems they rather expected a mid level, sound focused typical horror film, where they got this masterpiece, and it was too much for them.
About the film, I think Elisabeth Moss pulled over a master class performance. The story paced beautifully over the two hour scenario. The ending was just as well.
There are few plot holes I won't disagree. Like, when Emily gets her throat cut, the restaurant must have caught that in one of the security cameras. Also, about the suit, why was it built? Just to stalk his girlfriend? There are very little information for the viewers.
That is why I felt a 8 or 9 star would be more appropriate."
1475,"I actually liked it, but it was a one watch movie for me. It had me asking ""why didn't the eagles just fly them to Mordor?"" Why didn't she just take the suit and mess with him back? Why go back and use it at the end? So many plot holes. How is he getting everywhere? I wanted more I guess. I didn't get it and with 2 and a half hours they had plenty of time to deliver it."
1476,"The was way too long, the dialogue was pulled so long it the point it got annoying. And no offense, but Elizabeth Moss looked like she was having a seizure the entire scene she was ""fighting"" the ""invisible man"". I would definitely not watch it again. Nor is it worth it's Rotten Tomato score of 90%!"
1477,"Endings of these type of disturbing movies should be clear. From the beginning cee was the innocent one and at the end she is the evil. And if Tom was the who was murdering all those people, there is no reason behind it."
1478,"Side performances and plot were engrossing, overall I enjoyed the film to an extent.
However I didnt think the lead performance was good enough, it was cringey and inauthentic.
Also there were many plot holes towards the end of the film and totally stupid scenes which I wont talk about as spoiler free review.
If a better actress lead the film and the plot holes were more thoroughly patched and they got rid of one or two scenes I could see this being an 8/10 film."
1479,"Like others have said, the start of this movie is great. It's tense, mysterious, and exciting. Despite this, the intro scene is also where certain character decisions begin to annoy me - like when Cecilia decides to wave around her flashlight as she's running from her husband, rather than turning it off. Now this wasn't a huge problem or anything, it's only the beginning of what becomes an irritating pattern, finally culminating in a scene where Cecilia lies on the floor next to a gun, watching Adrian, who's wearing a flickering invisibility suit, murder almost a dozen security guards.I won't ramble on about the various dumb writing choices in this movie, but I will say that it was a disappointment. I went in not knowing the plot, other than that an invisible man exists and the protagonist is played by Elizabeth Moss. I was hoping that I would see a suspenseful, creepy horror movie, perhaps with some psychological elements to it (maybe something to make the viewer think Cecilia's really just insane). The movie does have some of these qualities, mostly in the first half, but eventually it just turns into a sci-fi action movie ending with a poorly acted antagonist in a predictable final scene.Besides Adrian's corny acting, and the obviously digitally-imposed breath that we see Cecilia and the invisible man take as they stand outside on a porch, the quality of this movie was pretty good. Moss sure can act crazy, and the violence is well done - but excessive.All in all, I think this movie was a let down. Watch it if you want a decent thriller but don't expect anything substantial."
1480,Pretty average movie. Not very great. Graded on a curve because this was one of the last movies we got to see in what were once known as theaters before the dark times hit. It was eh. You won't like it but you won't hate it. You will leave feeling indifferent. Rewatch Tiger King instead.
1481,"Can't move. Too tense. Must try and breath, and then relax, but not for long. From the initial scene we are in survival mode with our heroine and the beauty in this film is the tension created by the invisible assailant.At just over two hours long The Invisible Man is a relatively long horror and struggles to maintain the level of tension that is it's biggest draw and thus lacks the ability to keep the viewer engaged. Especially as the story line is pretty basic and almost assumed as you wait it out for the next action scene. It's nice to see Director Leigh Whannell in a much lighter horror relying on tension and jump scares rather than gore as in Saw his break through hit.
Elizabeth Moss is fantastic as the controlled victim who fights back, you'll recognise this from her powerful performance in the Handmaid's tale.
Everything happens in this movie that you think should happen, there's no unfair twists that will stick in your gut, everything is justified and the feeling of ease is almost boring.
Overall Invisible Man was enjoyable but nothing has stayed with me and I'll forget the storyline in no"
1482,"It's a waste of time, excepted and disappointing ending...
I'm mad at all the good reviews that people gave, I don't understand their taste...I should've trusted those bad reviews I read before watching the movie, and believed them when they said it was a waste of time...Please people if you don't have a good taste in movies please don't give reviews.
This movie was a bit entertaining in the beginning although the Title reveals it all... but then it got boring and so slow.
The scene in the hospital reminded me of John Wick, so unrealistic and annoying. (I hate john wick)
I give this movie a 5-6 maximum... no way it gets a 7.2/10"
1483,First thirty minutes get 3/10. The rest of the movie gets 2/10. I don't know why people rated this over 3 but they either need to watch decent movies or stop reviewing movies. My mistake was not going through a few reviews before watching.
1484,"Regardless of minor plot holes that everyone seems to be ranting about such as how does the invisible man get from his house to the protagonist's (by taking the suit off, driving, parking remotely and putting it back on, I assume) this film is really really great at exposing the absolute fear that Cecilia is going through after a mentally abusive breakup. (Scared to step out of the house, paranoid over hearing noises.) Scenes were directed so immaculately it seemed even I, the viewer, shared Cecilia's paranoia as any uncomfortably lingering shot could be the invisible man himself- you start to look at all the objects in the shot, the details, anything that might hint he's there. Cecilia looks worn out and portrayed as scary by everyone around her throughout the whole film, which adds an extra layer of charisma to her going bad-b at the end, putting the invisible suit on, killing her boyfriend and walking out looking femme fatal and poised; for once she doesn't need men in her life, and for once she is in control, and in fact, in a way this is the first film which shows the targeted female to become the invisible man herself, a big statement on abusive relationships. In retrospect you sort of can't believe she just did that... and like it."
1485,"Best movie I watched after so long
The movie was something different"
1486,Incredibly well made update of a modern classic. Edge of the seat suff with some outstanding tense scenes. Top notch performances all round. Plus an incredible music score.
1487,"There's really nothing special about this movie.
It's quite frankly boring tbh.
Typical story, nothing new...Watch if you're bored , but even then, meh"
1488,"Was excited to see this film with my wife but, why did they make the villain into a ""Super Villain"". It was like watching a Marvel anti-hero movie.Aldis was the highlight of the movie for us."
1489,The movie starts with an amazing thriller headstart but falls flat very soon with so many logical compromises and a dull screenplay.
1490,"I've seen quite a number of movies where people turn invisible. And I'd say that the Suit is so realistic. One look at it would make you believe it could turn one invisible. I'm particularly tired of machines solely turning one invisible, or a serum, or even a cloak or helmet like in the epic movies...
However, if Cecilia had a great plan escaping as seen at the beginning of the movie, why didn't we get to see another well thought out sophisticated and convoluted plan to trap and expose Adrian? Adrian was killed in such an easy way for a guy that the audience was made to believe that he knows what Cecilia was thinking.
I also feel that James should have been more involved in the situation than he was made to."
1491,Horror this movie is not. This is a very good movie where you could not look away it was there in your face all the way. The only bad thing I find is that they jumped a few scenes and they could have added more to tell more of a story there where a few good pieces where u where like what is going to happen next.the cameras on the suites was awesome they looked like eyes and it looked realistic. All in all it was a very good movie.
1492,"What seems like an interesting concept that ends up feeling a little predictable and tired some. The films tries very hard to be carried by this sense of suspense and the unknown, but it fails to truly build up that atmosphere, instead it turns itself into the simplest form of story, the framed murderer. The acting feels a little stiff, perhaps I am a little biased having watched The Bridemaid's Tale as Elizabeth felt stale at this point. Her character also isn't like able at all, and her motives are also often questionable. By the end of the film, the film felt it has long been derailed and it simply had to find a way to end."
1493,"Save your time, you've seen it before. It was like a paranormal activity, with a very ""meh"" twist.."
1494,"The movie is good, but after watching this film I was wondering something is lacking in the plot. They should have not revealed that Cecelia knows that his husband can become Invisible, it killed the uprising suspense"
1495,"So one thing he uses cameras and leds to reflect the image to the suit, but this is false as any light hitting the suit would leave a shadow, I was enjoying the movie a little but now i just lost interest and can see holes all the way through the movie now.Hollow man all the way"
1496,The movie is just plain boring. I was continuously waiting it to be over
1497,"The man built an invisible suit and had help & still got outsmarted that easy?
Wow i had high hopes for this , first of all . He went to those lengths to get a girl pregnant ? Are you kidding me? This guy must be the stupidest bruce wayne i can ever think off. He wanted to be with the girl that bad . But get her to the looney bin house first? All im saying is . If he wanted her . He could've super ultra easily kidnap that girl . And do what he wants and tell her what he wants. Wow just wow clearly a cash grab, and they got me . Im being nice with my rating."
1498,"If my mother didn't berate me for never sticking with things I would have stopped this waste of 2 hrs I'll never get back. Imagine this...you're hiding out when SUDDENLY you receive mail from a ""lawyer"" in a regular nondescript envelope. Do you (A) realize you're in danger & move again? (B) Satisfy some sick lack of self preservation & meet with the lawyer who, OH BY THE WAY REPRESENTS THE MAN WHO VOWED TO KILL YOU? Therein lies the moment when I should have turned...it...off. And by the way I LOVE Ms. Moss as an actress but even my admiration couldn't excuse my yawning & this movie's predictable plot."
1499,"There really isn't an explanation for how dumb this movie is. Everyone is just so slow and stupid with everything they do, and don't even get me started on the guards/cops in that hospital scene! Jesus Christ, inept or what?. It's actually very frustrating to watch."
1500,"This movie cannot compete in the thriller genre. You have bad acting all over, messed up plot, holes from the start to finish, just bad!!! And yet I can't find a reason why this creation is high on ratings and other gems are below 5... That shows a lot of what's going on"
1501,"I mean, people saw things moving solo and kept aiming the main character like she was the one doing it. Quite stupid, right? It's hard to believe that Adrian, who didn't kill the security staff even having the chance, would left the scene injured and have the time to kill the coms, so that the other employees wouldn't know that elizabeth's character wasn't the main concern. And the lack of purpose for characters like sydney even existing. I guess at the the word dumb is what comes when i think about it."
1502,"This IS a really good movie. It does have impact and a really great script and its not as typical as you would think ( Not at all) The acting is DAMN GOOD, especially the lead actress. She portrays her character in incredible ways!
I enjoyed it, but it was missing something. I'm not sure if it was the score or the direction, but somehow, something was just a little off. I felt it could have been a GANGBUSTER of a movie, but for some reason just 'missed it by that much"". It will hold your attention constantly and it will not bore you. I recommend this movie as a good, creepy little horror."
1503,"This movie really shows how directors can make anything scary. Most horror movies are usually scary because of how the monster/killer looks but in this movie you literately cant see the killer. One thing that is great about this movie is that you don't know when the invisible man is in the room or not in the room. There is one very scary jump scare and mild gore. It was so suspenseful because I was in a theater. I would recommend seeing it in a theater. A few things did go unexplained and I don't know if that made the movie better or worse. One thing that did make the movie better is Elizabeth Moss, she killed it. Overall great movie, would see it again"
1504,... the men that act like the character of the husband (or secretly wish they could).
1505,"I was not hugely excited to see this. The previews looked good but it was hard to tell if it was going to offer anything new. I was never so happy to have expectations shattered, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time until the credits started. The tension building is comparable to the best horror films ever made and the jump scares were all original and inventive, they not only made me jump but they all left me terrified for some time after because they all came when you'd least expect them to and all had horrible ramifications. The acting was superb, the character development, complexity and like-ability for the lead was incredible. You genuinely liked her and was rooting for her the entire time, admiring her intelligence. Even the character development of the young girl was better than most film leads. The twists had me genuinely shocked and an ending that could be looked at as unsure of what really happened or you were completely sure. It was one of the best horror thrillers I have seen in some time and that includes all the other great horror films that have come out in the last few years."
1506,"A psychological thriller has to be logical. Even though the direction is great, there are plenty of loop holes in the movie which make it a bad experience."
1507,"Too many , WHY but then this movie was a bit different than the older version of the same name. some thought was given to the term invisibility and a decent script made this a little bit diverse.
In nut shell not one of the best but an average."
1508,This movie went immediately from 8 to 5 when she cut her veins and she was still walking normally! Oh come oooon...
1509,"The movie started very nice, but ended badly. There are a lot of plot holes, that I couldn't watch this without thinking: ""this does not make any sense"". I didn't like the way that movie went after halfway, but I was hoping for some plot twist or something interesting.*spoiler*
At the end, when she killed her ex I was hoping, that in some moment he will tell her: ""surprise"". In my opinion, this would be a very good plot twist, but without it, I felt like the end was boring and predictable."
1510,Cause it basically shows the entire plot of the movie.It has some good parts with a little suspense and the effects are great. But the story isn't really captivating and I wish we had more backstory. I didn't really care much about the main character and that's pretty essential for a good thriller/horror.
1511,"Nothing new, nothing crazy or Inventive. But over all a good, fun watch. Quite a few tense parts, a couple of jumps I guess. Me and the girlfriend liked it anyway. Not so much a horror more of a thriller, suspense etc."
1512,"Never heard of or seen anything else with the lead character the melon headed moss, so many annoying moments where she could have killed the 'abusive' ex who had apparently committed suicide (do they actually check DNA or the body these days or just take your word for it if you say you're dead)
So many plot holes it's making my head hurt thinking about them all.
Watch hollow man with Kevin bacon instead it's a far better film."
1513,I love this movie so much! I watched it at the drive ins and I'm glad I did as I screamed out fairly violently during a few of the jump scares.The use of sound and noice in this movie is top notch.If you want a good suspense movie I recommend this movie. But I recommend putting your phone away and turning the movie volume up. You gotta get into it!
1514,"After staging his own suicide, a scientist becomes invisible using a suit to stalk and terrorise his ex-girlfriend.This is yet another adaption of HG Wells tale The Invisible Man, the domestic abuse angle offers a fresh perspective on the classic source material. It also, takes some of the intriguing urban elements of Hollow Man (2000) but replaces the traditional invisibility with a suit that came straight out James Bond's invisible car from Die Another Day (2002).It's well acted, Elisabeth Moss' performance as Cecilia the abused partner add emotion and weight to the proceedings. Aldis Hodge is notable as James Lanier, a police detective but it's Michael Dorman as Tom Griffin, Adrian's brother and lawyer who steals ever short scene he appears in.The invisible action and effects are well staged. Director Leigh Whannell offers subtle touches from visible breathe from an invisible source to appearing knives and floating guns. That said, it's terribly frustrating, if you're not partial to the 'no one believes me' scenario type of films. In this case the police and family refuse to believe her story. There's a nice reveal in the latter half but the final twist you can see coming a mile away.Overall, Whannell's film may not follow Wells' story or be as much fun as Hollow Man and other film adaptations but it is a welcomed and effective serious toned Invisible Man film, that comes with a reminder of the horrific abuse one can suffer from a partner."
1515,"Was really looking forward to seeing this movie and am even more disappointed. Thought it was going to be a edge of my seat thriller but I was sadly mistaken. Too predictable with too many ""goofs"".Elizabeth Moss is absolutely the only reason for giving it as many stars as I did."
1516,"The start is great in my opinion. There's a good hook until the invisible man became quasi-visible...and then it suddenly becomes a sci-fi. I'm personally not a sci-fi fan, but it seemed particularly out of place in this movie which starts in a very realistic way.To be honest at the beginning it sounds like something paranormal. I think it would have been nicer to stay with that idea... The ghost of an abuser ex literally haunting you.I was sort of curious and I tried to hang on until the end, which was kind of satisfying but the second half could have beem much more interesting."
1517,Flawlessly written. One of the best movies I've watched in a while.
1518,"A slow start but a very good finish, a very watchable film, it sticks out like a shining beacon after some of the crap in the last 12 months."
1519,I will never rent movies from places like this they should stick to just streaming would make more $. Who rents a movie for $19.99 really yall lost your mind.
1520,The story is taking a mysterious path and the end wasn't expected that much
1521,"In the middle of the movie I was about to give up watching, I thought it was crap, but it turned out to be a very clever idea , I liked it very much ."
1522,"Best horror movie i have watched so far
Surprises in this movie are everywhere
I was sure Sesilia was crazy until she poured the bucket of paint on him.
Amazing!"
1523,"From the opening scene all the way until the first reveal, I was on the edge of my seat squirming with anxiety. I love how throughout the movie, the camera just starts randomly panning around like something or someone was there; this really engages the audience. I notice throughout the pan shots that I was really concentrated on the background objects, like, if there was an indent in the couch cushions or if the curtains moved.
There were a few moments when Ce would do something that left me wondering why she did that because it didn't make any sense. Also, I'm sure how I feel about James. I'm not sure if it was how he was written or if it was the acting that left... off. I'm not sure how to explain it but his character didn't really fit.
Overall, an entertaining movie and I love how they change the premise from the original and made it more modern.
The phone in the attic was easily the most suspenseful part of the movie and honestly one of the most suspenseful horror scene in a while. But, my favorite part by far was the restaurant scene. You think that Ce and her sis was just going to agree to disagree (also love the comedic relief with the server) and then you see a floating knife, which I had to do a triple take on. That scene was totally unexpected and well played.
The main actress did a great job in playing a crazy person (she's probably really insane)."
1524,"I really liked this film. It was different and definitely grabbed my attention. Good movement too and not too drawn out, but didn't move too fast either. Definitely a good amount of suspense and thrill for my liking."
1525,"The film was absolutely stunning, just great! I'd recommend all of age to watch the film and see for themselves. It literally kept my spouse and I on the edge of our seats, guessing and craving for more to unfold in the movie. I myself am not a horror-film watcher, nor a movie-buff at that, but still managed to find great interest in this movie and found that it was the best of all time (at least out of all movies produced so far this year). I will not spoil it for you, but the film was stupendous and quite brilliant! It was a one of a kind making, with incredible actors and I'd definitely love to watch again; only to watch for things I had not caught the first go round. Not to mention, it wasn't too scary, but don't be shocked by the consistent twists and turns throughout the movie. Just lovely. Wow, excellent production; thank you for the film!!!! <3"
1526,"First of all, I would like to express my gratitude towards all my readers for taking out time to read my first film review.
This past weekend, I saw the movie The Invisible Man (2020). Since it is inspired by the famous novel of the same title by H.G. Wells, it was one to remember.
The story revolves around a woman, Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss), whose boyfriend, Adrain Griffin (Oliver Jackson Cohen), is working on the technology which enables one to become invisible. The movie starts with Cecilia waking up at midnight and tries to run away from the captivity of her boyfriend at an isolated house. She becomes successful in doing so with the help of her sister, Emily Kass (Harriet Dyer), she then stays with her sister's friend James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter, Sydney Lanier ( Storm Reid). While coping with her past she gets the news of Adrain's suicide, but soon she starts to feel the existence of someone you can't see, but can hurt you!
Watching this movie was a wholesome new experience for me. I even did not remember the names of the star cast. the acting of Elisabeth Moss is worth seeing. She has done a fantastic job. Other supporting casts have also done their part honestly. Direction and screenplay were also good. I can't judge the dialogue delivery since the movie was available in Hindi at my cinema.
Overall, it was an average movie and I would say it to be a one time watch. What didn't impress me was the storyline. I think it is a reboot of the novel storyline and I miss the invisible man wrapped with white bandages all over his body. But still, if you are free this weekend, you may watch it out."
1527,"I didnt expect alot and especially didnt expect to feel obliged to leave an 8/10 . Ms Moss carries the movie with a bravavo performance ( maybe that's bravado lol but I hope you know what I mean ) in what might have been a creditable but run of the mill story with a 21st Century twist , worth 5 or 6 at best . Being of a certain age and familiar with the book , the old b/w tv series when I was a kid and various remakes , I tried to put away my preconceptions and just found myself riveted . I must be in a good mood because I have given Bad Boys latest and this ..both 8/10 . Two completely different movies but both excellent in their genre and thoroughly enjoyable at a time when we all can do with being entertained
Ms Moss , who I have enjoyed in the Top of the Lake series , is an admirable actor with hopefully much more to come ."
1528,"Nice re-imagining of the classic book!
Very well done!"
1529,"Watching Elizabeth Moss in various movies and the famous Handmaid's Tale you cannot possibly not like her.
The Invisible Man (2020) quite a great movie this year where Elisabeth is doing her job marvelously.
I would say finally a role on her character, a role which marks her career in a positive way.
I'm saying this because I think after and before ""The Handmaid's Tale"", not all movies were overwhelming, but this one surely is.
The film is well constructed but seen from a different angle and concentrating on Cecilia Kasses character first, even though the story is quite a new one, quite authentic and different from the book by H.G. Wells.
However the Griffin name appears again along with the Invisible Man's character.
A worth watching movie, one of the best thrillers made this year !"
1530,"I had been worried this would fall next to Tom Cruises poor Mummy remake, but it didn't. This filmmaker clearly learned so much from James Wan, and has managed to carve out his own path as a writer and director. The Invisible Man is a clever and relevant film. It may not carry the title into the story, but it's a strong film. If you want a total remake, this isn't your film. Go back to the original for that. This brings that old story into modern technology, and the character's struggle, are relevant for our era. Strong film and intense to watch."
1531,"Elizabeth Moss is fantastic, the writing and plot are incredible, and the concept is a refreshing take on a classic tale!This is a fantastic movie whose only drawback is that it perhaps leaves too little to the imagination. Otherwise wonderful!Highly recommend!"
1532,"There have been innumerable movies made on H.G Well's Invisible Man but none could be as interesting as the recent one. Though the trailer of The Invisible Man could be just ordinary but after watching the movie, you will feel good about it.Probably his best work in Upgrade (2018), Leigh Whannell takes the old wine in a new bottle but gives a sparkling storyline with a solid twist. The Invisible Man begins with just an ordinary tale of a psychopathic husband who stalks his spouse until she decides to fight back but the captivating and eye-popping scenes is what makes this film stand apart from other Invisible Man films. I was blown by few scenes - Cecilia unknowingly killing her sister at the dinner table (probably one of the best scene I have seen in recent times), Cecilia throwing a bucket of paint to identify the Invisible Man as she peeps down from the loft , the chase scene at the hospital scene and finally the turned and twisted climax scene.I did not find much loose ends as I felt the film keeps on your toes throughout which proves that writing (also by Leigh Whannell) was strong. Technically, The Invisible Man boast of decent art direction and cinematography but it is a solid performance of the star cast, especially Elisabeth Moss who strikes the right balance between emotional and the fight scenes.Overall, The Invisible Man is definitely a very good watch which will keep you glued to screen for 2 hours 4 minutes. Highly recommended 3.5/5"
1533,"The protagonist is not a blonde good looking bimbo. The camera work is done in a very intelligent way that is suspenseful. The director, it appears wants to bring the emotion of uncertainty from the audience. To his credit it is done so well there isn't a lot of music in the movie. Superbly done and an ending I didn't expect. Be prepared for many surprises."
1534,"The Invisible Man is an Intriguing movie that takes a little time to unfold and clarify itself, but it manages to get your interest most of the time and stop your mind from wandering off.Pros
Good screenplay and storyGreat acting by Elisabeth Moss (Most of the rating goes to her)Good accompanying moody music overallGood special effectsConvincingly suspenseful atmosphere throughoutInterestingly enough endingCons
Aside Elisabeth Moss, weak acting by the cast, especially the detective and the daughterLacks solid logic and development as a backbone, be it the story or behaviorsWeak portrayal of the Doberman, as an unoriginal dog (which they are not), doing nothing useful, not recognizing a person (dogs never bark when they know the person by smell and specific sound pattern to the person, even if he's invisible) and going past the lead actress when they were walking toward the end of the movie. Trained dog, especially Dobermans, always keep the pace of the person alongside whom they are walking and never continue walking past if the person stops for whatever reason)Unoriginal, impersonal and dull male lead together with the behavior of the invisible man (could have been much stronger, more serious and more vengeful with sophisticated notes)Bad use of the runtime (124 minutes could have been put to a better use - impartially speaking)You watch this entertaining movie, enjoy the two hours spent and move past. That's not a movie to ponder upon.Maybe better next time, Mr. Whannell."
1535,"Very effective, with nary a stray or wasted moment. It starts building the tension from the very first scene and keeps its foot on the pedal for almost every minute of its 115 minutes' runtime.The background score, consisting of sequenced bass effects, is very effective. Elizabeth Moss is supremely well casted as she increases the sense of impending dread with her generally gloomy countenance.Leigh Whannell, the director, mines the classic story for fresh scares. His visualization is evident from the titling itself, with its use of water against rock.This was made on a budget of 5 million and had earned 70 million plus when the coronavirus hit and it found its way to the streaming portals.Very highly recommended. It is sure to impress you and to stay with you for long."
1536,This is pretty lame for an invisible man story. The guy has this ability to be invisible and simply hunts his ex wife. Utter crap. The effects are ok but I would advise to simply watch hollow man and tell your friends to do the same.
1537,"Great film was very griped and made you wonder who was lurking in every corner great story , great ending wont say too much watch it you wont regret it bravo üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëåüëåüëåüëåüëå"
1538,"There have been so many bad suspense thrillers recently I watched this film with a little trepidation. But after a slow start it had shocks and jumps galore. I even recognised the homages to the original film and TV series.
My only problem is I could see the twist in the ending coming a mile off. But all in all an enjoyable 2 hours."
1539,"One of best movies I've ever watched. The main idea of this movie may be simple to some of us. However, the screenplay, the acting, directing and everything else are really good. I also liked the mix between mystery, horror and sci-fi not to mention the brilliant performance of Elizabeth Moss."
1540,The story of how a psychopath manipulates his victims
1541,"Ive never imagined chasing and shooting at an invisible man before, but i still liked it"
1542,Brilliant star ruined by foolish scenes i tried very hard to enjoy scenes but stupidity did not let me. Dont know where it becomes a box office hit.
1543,"@garcwrites: The idea of invisibility has always been problematic for me. I've never really thought about as a super power, more of thing that would bring out your worst impulses. So seeing in the trailer that the Invisible man is essentially a stocker peaked my interest a bit. Because an invisible good guy is harder for me to buy into than a F*ed one.The movie manages to deliver a grounded scary story that doesn't vilify men, or showcases stupid victims. The film is gripping, and entertaining. The story is so cleverly woven that there is not a moment you're taken out of the movie because of something stupid that was said or some shark jumping.You feel as trapped and backed into a corner as Elizabeth Moss' character does. It is very easy for anyone to feel for the character or imagine themselves in that situation. There's no magic or mysticism here, it's so realistic that you understand and get why everyone around her act and react the way they do, because you most likely would have reacted the same.The shots and the score strikes the right tone, the acting is on point, Moss, Hodge, Reid, Griffin, Dyer, and Jackson-Cohen are amazing. It's not a big cast but they make this movie feel big. It is a smart movie well worth your time and very well made."
1544,"Ok ish movie about an abusive husband super scientist that fake his own death and wears an invisible suit and haunt his distraught wife.The thing that spoilt the movie is when the wife realized that an invisible person is haunting her, but did not bother to record a video of it, or the most typical thing, buys a thermal scanner.That dumb invisible suit is useless once you use thermal infrared camera, unless it was not yet invented yet? You got invisible suit, but no thermal camera? Lmao. Lame plots."
1545,"Watching this movie, makes me wants to eat my own poop"
1546,"The first 2/3 of the movie is good. Then the last third comes and it simply makes no sense. I get that they wanted the 'victim turned strong survivor' ending, and I have no problem with that, but have it make sense. The perfect ending was right there to be had and they blew it. It wouldn't have left the main character with the full redemption...but it would have been a much better ending no one saw coming. Too often modern Hollywood movies are more worried about agenda than story. You can achieve both...see Get Out for example. A few simple changes and this would have been an 8 out of 10. Instead...people who love the agenda will forgive and love, and people who care about story over all else will not like it."
1547,Everything about this movie is great! Hate that the sister died but other than that the whole movie ended and turned out just as I had hoped!
1548,This movie was made very very well. So intense and Moss really did a great job. Loved the way it was filmed. Not that much music made it even scarier.
1549,"Good sound, good music, but thats pretty much it. It seems to be a good thriller until they show you that hes invisible, literally. After that there are plenty of details like, ok this make no sense, but its a movie. I think is good for someone whos looking a little entretainment, but If you have your standars (probably you do If you are reading reviews) I wouldnt recommend it"

Rating : 6.8/10
Review :
The Invisible Man is so tense and stressful that it is brilliant.
The film has a deep tension throughout and
The invisible man is technically a very well-made thriller, but loses some few marks
due to some issues with the plot and also
it looses its way at the end.
All around good movie."
1551,"The movie is full of twists & turns till the end. At one point when you think it's going nowhere suddenly it lifts up and take you on another ride.
Moss does a great job in going from vulnerable to crazy to bad ass. She carries the movie through and through."
1552,"I'm a fan of Elizabeth Moss since I watched the brilliant series The Handmaid's Tale where she plays a very submissive and abused character. It's a role she can play like the best and in The Invisible Man she does it again. She's the lead character and she did a wonderful job. Whannell is a good director, he knows how to bring suspense. The Invisible Man is basically a couple hours of thrilling, not really horror, about an abusive relationship between a woman and an invisible man, that's the sci-fi part in this movie. The tension building is what keeps you focussed, the music adds to the ambiance, but I would have used that returning dark sound from The Handmaid's Tale though, that would only have added more suspense. One of the better movie I watched this year in this genre."
1553,This is a woman who named Cecelia who has an abusive boyfriend called Adrian who has been assisted by his brother into created a fraud that he has committed suicide. By doing so the two of them take turn in using the invisible customs to torture Cecelia making her look crazy when she told someone about the matter that he isn't dead and that he has figured out how to become invisible. Cecelia made her own investigation that Adrian is the one tauning her in which she took matters in her own hands and eliminate both Adrian and his brother. Shocking! Adrian never saw his death coming in the same way he staged his fake suicide.
1554,"Where would you put the invisibility cloak when you invented it?
A: put it where only you can find it. No one knows it exists
B: put it in a visible place in the house and the room code is the anniversary of our meeting. Besides, let my wife guess the invention"
1555,"The Invisible Man successfully reworks one of Universal's classic horror movies into a modern tale of mental abuse and manipulative relationships. Long shots down hallways and extended shots on empty space build tension and a sense of voyeurism due to the innate nature of the beast. The film's climax temporarily loses the sense of paranoia it so carefully crafted, but it manages to recover to a large degree afterwards. The Invisible Man is a must-see film for any fan of the psychological thriller/horror genre."
1556,"One of the best thrillers i watched in the last years. Biggest part of the thrill is psychological. Main actress fits perfect into the role, loved her performance. This movie is mostly thrilling from the first till the last minute, thank you!What i didn't like that much are the CGI-effects. Looking strange sometimes, breaking the immersion.Cheers
Fletcher"
1557,"Damn this movie was amazing. I went into the movie totally clueless without seeing any trailers or knowing about the plot and I gotta say it absolutely blew my mind. the way the camera is moving is fantastic. The genius behind Unsane, Saw and insidious sure knows how to build tension and makes us scared of something invisible. Elizabeth Moss gave a convincing performance and she was the right fit to this role. if I have to nitpick I gotta say the movie started really slow and it should have had a more fast paced intro. also it had some minor plot holes and inconsistencies but overall I had a good time with it and definitely recommend it to everyone"
1558,All the way from the start to the end main antagonist gives hard simp vibes.
1559,"... this is not. However, if you just shut down your brain and ignore the preachy #meToo subtext it's a serviceable movie."
1560,"""Upgrade"" writer & director Leigh Whannell, who wrote the first two ""Saw"" chillers and all three ""Insidious"" epics, has tweaked the classic H.G. Wells' novel ""The Invisible Man"" and delivered something different. Initially, Universal Pictures sought to reboot not only ""The Invisible Man"" back when Tom Cruise revived ""The Mummy"" (2017), but also launch a franchise comparable to the Disney/Marvel superhero franchise designated as the Dark Universe. The Dark Universe franchise would have featured ""The Mummy"" and ""The Invisible Man"" as well as ""The Wolf Man,"" ""Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" and ""Dracula."" Presumably, these monsters would have interacted in each other's movies, like ""Marvel's Avengers."" Audiences balked at this reboot. After ""The Mummy"" flopped, Universal abandoned the Dark Universe. Now, the studio has released a standalone, contemporary take on ""The Invisible Man"" which mashes up the unforgettable scary movie with a #MeToo stalker saga. Predictably, the protagonist is a woman. Moreover, an abusive boyfriend stages his own suicide, so he can stalk her without attracting attention. Not surprisingly, nobody believes her when she spouts this bizarre idea! Suspicious things begin to occur, and our heroine finds herself caught up in a murder & mystery which defies anything she has ever known.
""The Invisible Man"" remains the unstable madman he was in Wells' novel. Nevertheless, Whannell has altered both the conditions and the circumstances. The eponymous monster struggles to drive his girlfriend crazy because she refuses to live with him. Alas, Whannell never convinces us an individual in a unique suit could run amok in public without revealing himself. Mind you, the original ""Invisible Man"" relied on chemicals to remain incognito. This latest incarnation equips him with an optical suit, like a scuba outfit, that conceals him. Further, the ""Invisible Man"" is no longer the protagonist, merely the title character, while his girlfriend occupies the limelight as the heroine. A straightforward, low-budget, hide & seek melodrama, ""The Invisible Man"" will keep you guessing during its gripping first hour or so until you start spotting its plot holes. The premise is not without promise, but the filmmakers strain credibility. Essentially, Whannell makes everything is far too easy for this ""Invisible Man"" to escape detection.
""The Invisible Man"" opens at night as Cecilia Kass (Elizabeth Moss of ""The Kitchen"") slips out of bed on phantom feet and leaves her boyfriend, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen of ""Faster""), without awakening him. Gathering her personal belongs, she sneaks out into the garage. Those illusions end when she kicks their Dobermann's dog food bowl accidentally, and it screeches across the bare concrete floor of the garage. Seconds later, a car alarm erupts like Gabriel's trumpet. Desperately, Cecilia scales the wall surrounding Adrian's oceanfront estate. She reaches the road beyond their house, and a car halts to pick her up. Cecilia is relieved her sister, Emily Kass (Harriet Dyer of ""Killing Ground""), has come to rescue her. The two get the shock of their lives when a disgruntled Adrian materializes out of the gloom. He smashes his fist through the passenger's window, and Cecilia urges her sister to floor it!Cecilia lodges temporarily with a childhood friend, single-parent, San Francisco Police Detective James Lanier (Aldis Hodge of ""Hidden Figures""), and his college-age daughter, Sydney (Storm Reid of ""Sleight""), but our heroine is far from safe. Indeed, Cecilia only imagines she is safe, because she doesn't realize the enormity of Adrian's plans. First, he commits suicide by cutting his throat. Second, he uses his suicide as a cover to torment Cecilia. The first time Adrian's harassment occurs catches Cecilia off guard when Sydney and she are in the same room. Unbeknownst to Sydney, Adrian strikes her a glancing blow to the face, and Sydney accuses Cecilia of hitting her. Earlier, when Cecilia had been cooking a pan of eggs and bacon, she left the kitchen momentarily. The next thing she knows, the eggs and bacon have been burnt to cinders, and the fire alarm activated.By now, Cecilia is experiencing the first signs of Adrian's return. Meanwhile, Adrian's brother, a sleazy attorney named Michael (Michael Dorman of ""Killer Elite""), disputes her claim with photos of Adrian's body. Furthermore, he has Adrian's ashes in an urn. Of course, Detective Lanier has no idea how to treat Cecilia's preposterous allegations. Later, Cecilia and her sister Emily rendezvous at a public restaurant. One minute, Cecilia is conversing with her sister. The next minute, a huge carving knife levitates in the air and slashes open Emily's neck like cherry pie. Afterward, as if by magic, the knife flies into Cecilia's fist, and alarmed customers scream in terror.Arresting our heroine, the police transport her to a sanitarium. Cecilia reminds us of the old man who cried 'wolf,' because nobody believes her. Earlier, she learned about an optical suit Adrian had created to make himself invisible. Later, when our heroine is rummaging around up in Lanier's attic, she senses Adrian's presence and drenches him with paint. Now, even we can see Adrian as the paint reveals his outfit. Instead of the usual jump scares, Whannell uses the scenes when Cecilia exposes Adrian in his suit as jump scares. Eventually, our heroine makes believers out of the skeptics. The scene when Adrian enters the sanitarium sight unseen and tangles with several armed guards stands out for its agile choreography. These security guards watch in stunned disbelief as something they cannot see disarms and shoots them with their own hardware! Now, the cat is really out of the bag, and the authorities believe Cecilia.The improbable thing about ""The Invisible Man"" is how Adrian's invisible suit enables him to mingle in public without calling attention to himself. Sadly, despite its superior production values, ""The Invisible Man"" qualifies more as thriller than a chiller. Whether or not you see through ""The Invisible Man,"" the performance of ""Handmaid's Tale"" actress Elizabeth Moss and the sympathy she generates for her heroic plight makes the half-baked hokum worth-watching despite its outrageous plot holes."
1561,"Right from the release of the trailer I just had the feeling this was going to be a pigs ear of a movie, and my feeling was dead on, still can't figure out what the writers point was for this story, except maybe that we're all the same, whether female or male we're all just human garbage.
Typically stories like this will show the hero's struggle against the villain, in this they're no different to each other, there's no hero just 2 villains, no redeamable quality's in either of them, just like all the ""gangster"" movies whose characters no one cares about because there is nothing for anyone to identify with, just another pointless story about pointless characters.
The decision to change the science from the original story is interesting, although extremely flawed, don't get me wrong the depiction of the suit with hundreds, possibly thousands of microscopic cameras is easily one of the highlights of the movie, we're it possible it would already be in the real world, as is only flat static objects work with this technology, no amount of money or time will ever change that, knowing that just highlights this as nothing more than a silly plot premise, better the story was kept to that of an evil scientist that had discovered the secret of invisibility & slowly turns insane from its over use,
Moss's character escapes from an abusive relationship, after hearing the abuser is dead she then meets the brother for a reading of the will & is told she's been left ¬£5 million, now this is the writer's chance to show the ""hero"" for what she is by having her tell him to shove the money, but no, she happily accepts it, as if all the abuse was OK because of the ""payday"", for me that's when this movie lost its way, this was less of an observation of a victims point of view & more ""let's just get to the payoff at the end"", a huge missed opportunity by the writer/director to show the abused as the hero rather than just another ""gold digger"".
¬£123 million gross from a mere ¬£7 million budget is nothing to be sniffed at, even with the limited cgi effects, I can only assume the actors took minimum wage or maybe a percentage from the box office, the cgi /special effects when used are extremely good.
Unfortunately this movie was always going to be let down by its story & lack of character development, as the viewer we're not privy to the abuse experienced by moss's character so have no prior knowledge of choen's characters ""evilness"" & the description of the ""abuse"" by moss's character fails to describe cohen's character as anything other than a control freak & certainly not that of a sociopath.
Again poor story was the reason for so many plot holes & the asylum incident was always going to be compared to T2 because its literally a rip off of that scene, these are supposed to be ordinary people within an extraordinary story yet cohen's character shows no restraint in murdering innocent individuals, this is not a case of ""the invisible man becoming insane"" because he isn't invisible his suit is, he can remove it when ever he wants, the classic story & the movie ""Hollow man"" shows how being invisible for a sustained amount of time can slowly turn the person insane & enable them to do shocking terrible things, choen's character would seem to be capable of these things invisible or not, again lack of on screen character development robs the audience of witnessing this.
As so many Reviewers have remarked this is ""the invisible man"" story told from the victims side, an interesting premise that the writer / director fails to do justice to, at the end of this moss's character is again given the opportunity to become the ""hero"", yet after 5 minutes of begging choen's character to admit his guilt in what has ensued she opts for donning the ""suit"" she hid earlier in the movie & slits his throat, an ending that was so obvious for all to see, again ordinary people don't do these things, no doubt leigh whannell's idea was to show moss' character as the ""tough woman"" yet she just comes across as another sociopath, this movie should have concluded with the ""asylum"" scene with moss's character finally shown as the hero, the earlier scene of her hiding the suit should have shown her taking it & the end scene of her agreeing to meet with choen for dinner should have been replaced with Cohen led in bed alone at night woken in fear by the word ""surprise"" leaving the audience to ponder whether she will now terrorise him or if he'll meet his death at her ""invisible"" hands.
All in all not a bad movie, but not a particularly good one, the lack of time passing between scenes & within scenes was another thing that let's this down, for example when moss' character visits the house after she's been attacked in her friends home, she finds the suit then hides it & is then confronted with ""the invisible man"", how did he get there so soon after she did? No vehicle was seen entering the grounds so what did he use to get there? This was a long drive so not somewhere he could get to on foot, plot holes such as this ruin the illusion of story's like this, this is just 1 story/plot hole, this movie has so many it can literally be torn to pieces, perhaps the original runtime was much longer & it's suffered from editing, whatever the case, this movie done right could have been epic, as is, it's a failed attempt, a better director would & should have seen how good this could really be, unfortunately this will be nothing more than a missed opportunity."
1562,"The Invisible Man starts off well. We get the notion that we are in for a treat and towards the middle of the film the treat turns more into a simple snack... While the first half of the film intrigues and intensifies while even nearly going a little too far with that, the second half of the film was almost what I feel like I have seen dozens of times in thrillers. Simple twist at the end and you care for the character and the position she's in and the story itself is still intriguing although there are plenty of plot holes making me question certain things. Over looking those plot holes and the near run of the mill feel of the second half of the film I believe it is a fresh movie with fresh ideas but just simply comes off feeling like a really good thriller and not something as great as it could have been. I give The Invisible Man a 75%."
1563,"Driven by a solid lead performance from Elizabeth Moss, Leigh Whannell's modern take on the classic story by H.G Wells is refreshing in its own right. Whannell wastes no time in telling the audience how desperately Cecilia wants to run away from her abusive, 'optics genius' boyfriend Adrian. That almost-dialogue-free opening scene really sets the tone for what's to follow.Moss takes on the role of the Hitchcockian heroine here, with Psycho (the build-up to the shower scene) and Vertigo (the S.F setting) appearing to be great reference points. Even the musical score (Benjamin Wallfisch) seems to be inspired by Bernard Herrmann's work. Whannell, who had impressed me with Upgrade a couple of years ago, has now successfully tackled another sci-fi subject with horror undertones to it.With an efficient Moss in the lead, the scenes where Cecilia suffers one setback after another, are convincing - a good example of a performance elevating the writing. Cecilia, as we see her, is initially shown to be afraid to step out of the house after the escape incident. Initially, Whannell toys with the idea of Moss' PTSD troubling her a little too much; it takes a while for the audiences to believe what she's trying to tell everyone around: her dead boyfriend is now somehow invisible and trying to annihilate her (and others close to her).The 'oh damn!' moments of this thriller are neatly executed. The restaurant scene was particularly impressive, as was the climax. Moss', whose transition from helpless to scared to a woman seeking retribution (for everything she's gone through) is what makes The Invisible Man a moderately entertaining flick. The jumpscares, however, are some of the film's weakest elements. Some loopholes also need to be overlooked - CCTV footage is brought up as a piece of crucial evidence only when the film nears its completion. Watch it for Moss, over all else."
1564,One of the best movies I've watched in the horror genre for a long time. Director Leigh Whannell is really gifted and fell in love with him after Upgrade. This is another Masterpiece from him. The plot makes a lot sense and performances especially from Elisabeth Moss were exceptional. Effects really looked realistic and convincing and Whannell being able to pull this off with a low budget of $9Mil makes me appreciate him and his projects the more. I really recommend this movie üëå
1565,"Good solid example you don't need a ton of money to make a good horror/suspense film.
Good acting , most of it done by lead actress, great action and scares, the first half is better than the last but nonetheless I really enjoyed this movie. I predicted the ending a l but nice couple of twists tho, probably the best of the invisible franchise so far. Won't disappoint for sure."
1566,"A thriller done right. The suspense was the greatest accomplishment this movie had to offer among many other attributes. Every songless scene, every faint sound effect, every camera angle all aided in building a tension that at times was never broken. However, when destroyed would feel entirely earned through premium scares that never fell short of authentic. A huge part of such amazing tension was birthed from a simple yet effective shot where simply nothing happened in frame, really emphasizing that invisible man facade and bringing to life Cecilia's constant anxiety to the audience. Elisabeth Moss murdered her role, achieving an exhausted, vanquished woman defined through violence such as s emotional manipulation, and psychological warfare all weighing down on her fabricating a person about to snap. The ending felt truly earned and as such had myself mentally applauding for the death of the cockroach of an antagonist! And in regards to the antagonist, the new iteration of the Invisible Man brought to life through technological means was a perfect addition. Providing an alternate
solution for invisibility other than through paranormal or magical elements grounded the concept better than most thrillers care to do.
Leigh Whannell did wonders with his seven million dollar budget,
focusing primarily on composition, angles and locations to help emphasize this cold, cruel world that our protagonist has to endure. This
movie is a breathe of fresh air and although not game changing still serves as a great two hour piece of entertainment!"
1567,"Elisabeth Moss, AKA one of the best television actresses of our time, showed that she could shine in any platform of acting and that includes film. Elisabeth Moss was just terrific in this one of a kind thriller, capturing the horror that her character went through. This film did a great job keeping you on your toes, and you will never expect what will happen, an attribute every great suspense film needs. Elisabeth Moss deserves at least a Golden Globe nomination at least for her performance."
1568,I thought it was very well done. Had my on the edge of my seat and swimming in anxiety: as a true thriller should!
1569,"I was skeptical that a remake of The Invisible Man could be any good in 2020. I have to admit I had preconceptions about what a 2020 film might entail considering how Hollywood has relied on CGI as a crutch to hide bad writing. Even the trailers didn't sway me much since the scenes in the trailers are of the few CGI scenes in the movie.But holy cow, has Elisabeth Moss and director Leigh Whannell Knock It Clear Out of The Park. The writing is actually outstanding, the camera work, atmosphere is too. Elisabeth Moss acting performance matches Whannell direction. The tension in this movie is so thick can feel it in my skin. If she doesn't earn an Oscar during her acting career, the Oscars are truly worth. This movie is a must see. It's unfortunate the last scene in the film undermines the story. It would have been better if Adrian had gotten away with it, it would have made the ending much more powerful. But having Cecilia walk away after that last scene undermines the story. But I am still giving the movie a 9 because Moss' performance was so amazing."
1570,"Watched a nice movie after a while. Not only the cast and leads especially Elisabeth Moss have acted superbly. Wonderful screenplay and direction.
Moreover, in this edition the invisiblity is not through some magic portion and the scientist is not a pervert like previous editions.
A good and a must watch."
1571,"It's interesting to see the majority of the written reviews being 10s or 1s.
The first half of this movie was hands down excellent, although I feel like the director should have left the audience a bit more in the dark.
The second half contains a 1-2 ""face-palm"" kind of moments where the main character makes some slightly less logical choices, but with a bit of thought it's easy to explain away the ""holes"" some of the reviews talk about (i.e. the movie didn't show certain things, which maybe they should have somehow, but with a bit of critical thought it can easily make sense.. if you're not a hater)
Note: hater is described as anyone giving this movie less than a 5. This was easily one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a months, and certainly is not worse than a 5."
1572,"A beautiful movie and a new and enjoyable idea, the story is terrible and the heroine of the film is very beautiful"
1573,"Instant Sci Fi Horror Classic!!!Well acted, directed and perfectly cast- acting was spectacular.One thing I would like to say (especially to Universal), this is two in a row! Keep on this trend and you should be winning back audiences and filling up theaters.I have to admit that I was hesitant to watch because I didn't want a liberal radical identity narrative- I have walked out of many theaters and now don't give these flicks a chance, even if it means having missed decent movies. And, I noticed a touch of insensitivity in me with respect to empathizing with the victim. But, I took a minute and checked that, then went back and enjoyed this very good movie. Identity politics has ruined much of our experiences and caused a revolt against the promoters. There is so much more to life than living like that.So, I look forward to seeing what the future of movies will be after all the bs is gone from our society conscience."
1574,"I'm a fan of horror genre, specially when a movie employs suspense as a scaring factor. That's what this movie employs well in it's first half when you're still trying to guess what's going on.
But once you get the whole idea and the main back bone of the movie gets clear (which is much more sooner than it should have been) the plot holes begin to emerge, and most obvious the security cameras in the restaurant and the psychic hospital which for no reason no one cares about, the ""ready to grab the knife"" hand of the girl in the restaurant, the easy washable paint in one scene ...
The idea of the movie is not original of course, but it starts pretty decent, uses good CGI (few times when it employs it) and good music but disappoints through it's course."
1575,"This 2020 thriller tells about a woman, Cecelia (Elizabeth Moss) who tries to get out of an abusive relationship. She learns that her boyfriend supposedly dies, but becomes stalked/haunted by an invisible presence that may be him making her life a nightmare where she can't escape. This is a different take on the character that is pretty good, Moss does a great job, the score is good and there's nice scenery/settings. There's some moments that resemble ""Predator"" and ""Hollow Man"" with some neat effects. Give this a try if you enjoy thrillers, sci-fi or horror."
1576,"Anyone who gave this more than a 5 is in on the scam.
The plot holes and total disregard for logic were so overwhelmingly bad it was very hard to enjoy the movie.
You couldn't see the villain but that ending you could see it coming a mile away."
1577,"I had two first impressions of this film. One, that it was infinitely more successful than ""The Mummy"". Ten minutes into here, and I knew that this is a great film. Ten minutes into the other, and I never got any farther. (Not sure many others did, either.) The second immediate impression is that Elisabeth Moss is once again turning victimhood into an ATM. But that's just a stumbling block. You can be as irritatingly typecast as that, and if your performance is good -- as hers is -- it just doesn't matter. Universal has hit this one out of the park. Yes, any connection to H. G. Wells is long-forgotten. It's okay. Leigh Whannell has learned a ton during his stint in the ghost story realm, and the end result brings to mind both Hitchcock and Welles. It also signals that Whannell is no longer James Wan's Padawan learner. Beautifully plotted, atmospheric, visually impressive, with its feet firmly on the ground. Universal has carved out its own space, when, before ""Joker"", most of us assumed that the MCU had all of that covered."
1578,"An unnerving, slow-burn horror film/badass, Termintor style sci-fi horror with a great performance by Elisabeth Moss.It's full great sequences full of tension and paranoia.It suffers a bit towards the end. When it seems like it's about to end it pulls a twist and keeps going for another ten minutes that feel unnecessary, but it didn't take away that much from my enjoymet of the film.Really enjoyed it."
1579,"I watched the film and of course is sad to see anyone suffering domestic abuse struggle to escape someone. The staying with friends, seemed great, but felt slow. The typical tactics of the abuser seemed realistic and common and felt like would build for a gripping torture session of ups and downs, but as the victim seemed to be pushed into a corner, and locked in an asylum, they escape with ease, From the asylum the film went downhill.Suddenly with the suit malfunctioning no cameras at the asylum catch the person, no one notices as the suit flashing on and off due to damage. As the film drags on in a game of cat and mouse, No changing the numbers on the doors, no extra security of someone entering the house, the ease of finding the suit, it felt poor and full of plot holes.As the film ends even the thought a murderer is still running round fine with no problems, able to stay at home, maybe they are clueless on the justice system. As the same invisible suit that doesn't see the suicide at the end, wasn't active anymore or proved as invisible suit when found due to damage.Add to that the idea of invisible suit when one person is in a house with another, who they hate, suddenly committing suicide. Poorly thought out.."
1580,"If you like to go to Douban to go through the movie list of movies, you will find a lot of tickets for ""fairy movies"", or ""ghost movies"": most of them have the names ""thriller"", ""fierce"" or ""midnight ""The poster is in the style of a ghost story magazine. No one has marked it, and no one wants to see it, even without a rating. This is the lower limit of horror movies-the most terrifying thing about this movie is that you don't understand why there will be investment in this movie."
1581,"Before I start, I will say that I had somewhat high expectations for this movie. I had done my research, (and by research I mean watch dozens of reviews), and it seemed like my type of toe-clenching suspenseful movie.But when I went to watch it for myself, it was a bit disappointing. The problem, for me, was the story line and the overall pace of the movie. Due to the slow pace, the tension just wasn't there. By the time the 'jump scare' finally came out, I was trying not to fall asleep.There were, of course, positive things about this movie, one of them being the casts. Elizabeth Moss, as usual, was fantastic in this movie. After watching Handmaid's Tale, I just fell in love with her acting. others supporting actors were great as well.Overall, there just wasn't enough adrenaline rush for me."
1582,"The Invisible Man is mostly a fantastic horror movie. This film is a perfect example of how to use tension effectively. Several scenes in this movie are absolutely horrifying, despite the lack of jump scares, with a perfect atmosphere created by Leigh Whanell. The Invisible Man's antics are incredibly disturbing and cause anxiety for the viewer as well as the characters and the dominance he has over Elizabeth Moss' Celicia, even in death, is unbelievably sickening. Elizabeth Moss is absolutely outstanding in the lead role, delivering a wonderful performance, which causes the viewer to truly buy the trauma her character suffers. However, this movie really slips in quality during the third act. During which, the perfect psychological horror movie, this film was about to become, is destroyed. The third act involves an incredibly confusing plot twist and a completely ridiculous plot device that causes the movie to dip way too much into science fiction. Although the final scene does manage to restore some of the amazing quality from the first ninety minutes, with a satisfying enough conclusion, I would overall call The Invisible Man a good horror movie, that was very nearly so much more."
1583,"There are a few plot holes, but overall its good enough and has some excellent qualities that make the film an overall worthwhile watch."
1584,"Well acted by Ms.Moss but not much of a stretch from playing June.
Harriet Dyer is brilliant but underutilized
Spoiler......
Who was meant to be feeding the dog?
Why did her wrist not bleed on the corridor floor or her clothing?"
1585,"In general, the film is not bad. I really liked the sharp moments. I liked the scientific explanation and reality of this film. As always, the main character is shown by a fool for other characters. In the end, the hero plays the situation in his favor."

It's awesome to see another move that comes from the mind that created Saw, Leigh Whannell. This movie is constantly tricking you to believe one thing when really it's something else. This strategy in turn makes the movie very interesting and the opposite of slow. The acting is okay, but the story is great! Not one too miss."
1587,"This visually impressive horror thriller is no masterpiece, and certainly unoriginal in the extreme but should lead to greater things for all concerned.We are going to see a lot of survival tales before we get rid of the taint of Harvey Weinstein, and this is one of those. It isn't a chick flick per se - but most of the negative reviews will come from men as the male characters are only there to sell the progress of the heroine.I think it is fairly brauvera storytelling despite this, with enough of a twist to guide you away from the few logistical plot holes. I'm no fan of horror, but this certainly improves on the truly terrible Hollow Man, and enough of the work is done in your head to make the bumps all the greater. It sells out to Hollywood style before it has to, but maybe next time something will take flight."
1588,"The idea of invisibility is vintage, this is a refined version intended as reboot but more horror blended into it. Every scenes was expected, there are flaws obviously, ain't no CCTV in the restaurant and we are living in 2020? To add irrelevant quote on it on this time of ""Unseen, just like the virus"" - Covid-19"
1589,"The demise of the Dark Universe has opened up opportunities for filmmakers to do something with those classic Universal horror characters. As ""The Invisible Man"" has proved - they can be a goldmine in the hands of the right producers, as this relatively low budget, smartly made, feature has been a big hit.Having escaped from her abusive partner, Cecila Kass (Elisabeth Moss) slowly begins her recovery at a friend's house. Her anxiety only alleviates a little when she discovers that Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) has taken his own life. Her unease returns though, when she starts to feel like she's being watched, though nobody is there, emails are sent that she didn't write and things go missing around the house. She believes that Adrian has faked his death and is somehow in the room with her, but is this the case, or is this the effect of the years of physical and psychological abuse that she has received?Whilst I can't imagine that ""The Invisible Man"" is going to be anyone's favourite film of all time, it's much better than it could have been in the wrong hands. To be clear, Leigh Whannell and the Blumhouse team are exactly the right hands. With no inherent desire to make a film servicing any bigger idea than this one movie - ""The Invisible Man"" manages to contemporise the story, whilst still remaining emotionally true to the original and to say something about the lasting effects of domestic abuse without compromising on entertainment. It is, in effect two movies. The first half is like a poltergeist movie, with Cecila slowly tortured by the invisible Adrian, whilst suggesting that it might all be in her mind. It's very tense and makes you scan the screen constantly looking for any clue as to where ""Adrian"" might be. The second half (I'll keep the review spoiler free, so I'll not explain what's happening) is more of thriller - the tension dissipates a bit, but there's some excellent visual effects.Elisabeth Moss is great, as always. Carrying the movie from start to finish she's in literally every scene. Her character transition points are marvellous. Nobody else in the cast really stands out, both in a positive or a negative way. Moss's ability allows the film to save time (and money) in other ways. You don't need a flashback to see the abuse she's received - as her face can tell the whole story.I doubt I'll revisit it very often, but it was a decent experience."
1590,". . . which frequently talk about girding oneself with the figurative armor of this or the metaphorical cloak of that, THE INVISIBLE MAN explains how nefarious media moguls have invented ""Fox and Fiends,"" which gives its ethics-challenged deplorable sociopathic participants the illusion that they have donned cloaks of invisibility, enabling them to strut down public avenues slaughtering We True Blue Loyal Patriotic Normal Average Progressive Union Label Working Stiffs at will, with no consequences to themselves (at least on THIS Earth!). When milquetoast lawyer ""Tom"" puts on his Fox and Fiends suit, he gains superhuman strength, rubbing out about a dozen heavily armed law enforcement officers. ""Adrian"" and ""Cecilia"" similarly defect to the Dark Side as soon as they strap on the Fox & Fiends breastplate with reckless abandon. THE INVISIBLE MAN informs its viewers that America is now living through the prophesied End Days, when the streets will run shoulder deep with human blood. Throughout recorded History, Public Enemies have signed over their souls to Old Scratch, and traipsed across the Corpses of the Righteous with the false ""sense of security"" of an INVISIBLE MAN. However, the Piper always has to be paid in the end, through the Perpetual Night of Eternal Torment, the grim outcome of THE INVISIBLE MAN suggests."
1591,Such an amazing movie with soooo great actors. everyone should watch this one!!
1592,"*Minor Spoilers*I make mention of certain scenes or objects that will add an unfair sense of anticipation and expectancy in scenes you should go into blind.This film features many, many instances of well thought-out moments and details; many of which are just tiny things, but it's the tiny things that make all the difference. Little details that the producers clearly gave much thought really help this film go far with depth and substance. For example, the way the ladder is introduced, then used later; same with the painting of the walls and the paint.
The ending, I found, was a little bit weak and rushed. It felt as if they spawned their idea for the ending, and were so excited to make it, that they overlooked important details. I also found it lacking of any real meaning or message, as the film carried a theme of domestic abuse. The film proposed this theme and message, but then said nothing of it with its ending. I was left sitting there thinking, ""well, what is that supposed to mean? What are they trying to say about their theme?"" There were also instances of overlooked details that ruined the realistic feel, making the film lack authenticity.Also, violence doesn't make films good, it just makes them violent. I found their level of gore inconsistent. The final act of the film lacked scare for me and felt underdone. On the other hand, the small cast worked wonders, and I was on the edge of my seat for, definitely, the first two thirds of the film. I loved how they worked with just a few characters. Unfortunately, the ending scene in the house did feel quite low-stakes.When it has you hooked, it really does, but it fails to finish in a fulfilling manner, and I also think they misrepresented James's character in the end. I would have preferred an ending where they tried less, so they could have fleshed it out and done it properly, so it would have held up to the standard set by the rest of the film.
Overall, quite enjoyable. Good scare. For me, not one worth watching a second time, right way, anyway."
1593,"Amazing, incredibly well acted psychological thriller. Highly recommend for thriller fans, and has a few great graphic scenes."
1594,"With great direction, photography and acting, ""The invisible man"" is evidence of how good remakes and modern horror can be when done with passion and genuine care for your work. Although it stumbles with some logic issues, continuity mistakes and predictable elements, the film keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes your heart beat faster with each minute that passes. An smart and well made thriller with some great statements about abusive relationships and their victims."
1595,.....that Elisabeth Moss played Jodie Foster really well!
1596,"The movie was to long, and it was very predictable and boring at parts. I also wouldn't really call it a horror, it had a couple of decent creepy moments, but devolves into an action/sci-fi in the second half. I wouldn't rush out to watch this in the theatre."
1597,"And nobody else did either - until it was too late!
Very suspenseful and a modern take on a classic horror tale. Well directed and acted, with some great twists."
1598,Starts slow but is pretty good. Fantastic ending!!
1599,The invisible Man was a ok movie I think that you might want to check it out
1600,I did not want to see this movie. I knew that this film was part of the Dark Universe and frankly...the mummy sucked. My wife dragged me to this and the first scene immediately had me hooked. This film is not what I expected at all. Elizabeth Moss is one of the great actors of our age and is always wonderful and she takes this film like a battering ram. You cannot take your eyes off of her. ..One of the best films of the year. Absolutely riveting and will leave you breathless....There was one scene in there where I actually shouted involuntarily at the screen. I have never done that before. Many films build you up and have a terrible ending... I am almost afraid to enjoy a movie because often they can let you down and can be totally unsatisfying. The Invisible Man is very satisfying and the ending had us cheering .. we left the theatre like we had seen our favourite rugby team win the championship game..
1601,"Let me start off by saying one of the best things about this film is the great performance from Elisabeth Moss. Another reason to go see this film is because of the director who previously made upgrade in 2018 which was also pretty good and in this film he uses visuals to guide you through a lot of the film, mainly using some cool camera movements. And of course the horror and it works even though I wasn't frightened by the film it was very intense and this film had a very dislike able villain. Anyway ignoring my one small issue with the film I recommend you go see this in theaters."
1602,"I am disappointed by the amateur actors and not convincing story. Although the main idea is good and graphics are good, the way it is all explained, lack of reality, sudden not connected random things happening make this very low quality movie. Even the main idea - the invisible suit and the disappearance of husband look unreal and is not explained fully even in the end. It leaves us with emotions of disappointment, ignorance, fear. The main question that this movie deals with is how to convince somebody something. Not finished, not good enough."
1603,"It's been a long time since I've been fortunate enough to be this much on the edge of my seat throughout a movie. The Invisible Man takes an admittedly hokey premise, updates it, and infuses it with a truthful, emotional center and a brilliant performance by Elisabeth Moss.When an abused wife escapes from her psychotic husband, she believes all her problems are gone. Even better, she learns that he's since killed himself and left her 5 million dollars. Eager to rejoin the human race, she starts trying to rebuild her life, but she starts to get the creepy feeling that she's being watched. Is her husband really dead or has he found some way to fake his death and continue terrorizing her. Even scarier, is she just going insane?The Invisible Man works so well in no small part to a taught script and directing job by horror veteran Leigh Whannell and a genius performance by Elisabeth Moss who manages to make a woman staring at walls and empty chairs captivating.Even better, the film's marketing hasn't given away every single twist like they usually do, so there are tons of surprises in store, each one upping the stakes for our heroine.The Invisible Man is an absolute must see for any serious horror/sci-fi/thriller fans."
1604,"The movie started off appealing with nice cinematography perfectly showing the tension with her own life and others' perspectives towards her. The reason why people did not trust Cecilia does not make much sense.
The ending was thrilling though it was trying too hard to offer something unexpected. The movie could have ended earlier and in a better surprise that contains deeper connotation."
1605,"Ok so this was fun I'll be honest, if you watch it like a fiction film, the movie moves at a good pace and they try to explain all their ideas so it was pretty entertaining.Spoiler
My one issue is how the hell does the guy not produce a shadow. They tried making the film logical by using a current invention regarding cloaking using cameras. Except here it's been perfected in the form of a body suit. But that doesn't change the fact the he is still a solid figure that does not allow light waves to go through him, so its no way possible to make him 100% invisible. There was another movie that explained it with a serum that made him and his organs invisible which makes the whole ""shadow"" thing more probable but this film didn't really get it and I'll be honest it bugged me.But I'll be honest, it was just me. The acting wasn't bad. The shocking moments where fun and if you just sit down and watch it for what it is, it's pretty enjoyable."
1606,"Nice suspense, but ultimately not a brilliant film, difficult to say what is missing. A good film to watch but not worth paying to go to the cinema to see it."
1607,"It feels about time for an updated version of ""The Invisible man,"" so here we are. The new take here is that our heroin has previously been mentally abused by this guy. Who now wants to take that to a whole new level.As a psychological thriller this works well, and there is plenty of suspence and shocks for sure. There are some decent new ideas amongst the same old stuff, but the cast isn't all that great and it also feels like it could of gone a bit further than it does. It's not an all out horror which is a shame, and it's ending/finale won't be for everyone."
1608,"The story is nice. The music is in harmony with the scenes. The variety of the locations are not that much. This is the story of an abusive husband who makes her wife escape. The story makes you follow. Elisabeth Moss is wonderful like always. I have seen better plays from her. But she makes you believe the story is real. The ending of the story could be better. However, this was a very nice movie and I enjoyed watching it."
1609,"I enjoyed this version of the Invisible Man but their were so many undeveloped character portrayals. Firstly, what was the relationship between the cop and Cecilia? I must have missed something there. Secondly, why did Cecelias sisters death seemed downplayed ? Finally, how did this suit get manufactured? We didn't see any type of construction unless I missed that too. Otherwise, this was a good movie full of suspense."
1610,Jump scares. Mediocre writing.Giving 5 stars for the acting of the lead actress.
1611,Never has any movie put me on edge for a long time like this one has. Moss's expressions literally carry the movie all the way over to the end. Highly recommend watching this !
1612,"Following the critical and commercial failure of what was intended to be the foundations of a cinematic universe, Universal Pictures execute a surprisingly good last-minute save with The Invisible Man. By wisely positioning the film as a standalone feature rather than a follow-up to Tom Cruise's The Mummy, director Leigh Whannell's take on the iconic horror character is able support its own weight and explore its own themes.Whannell has a proven track record within the genre, his contributions to the Saw and Insidious franchises setting contemporary trends for both  supernatural horror fare respectively. His gift for consistently effective scares is evident here also, as The Invisible Man makes striking the perfect balance between tension and jump scares look easy. Any seemingly cheap tricks or loud noises are perfectly earned, and all the more effective for it.Elisabeth Moss is refreshingly cast, an actress of experience who can carry the whole film with simply her facial expressions. The strength of her performance renders the film's themes particularly prominent, transcending the basic premise and making the feature as much about the concepts of domestic abuse and toxic relationships as it a damsel in distress.A late reveal concerning the nature of the titular antagonist will certainly be polarising - if not demystifying - to some, although it undeniably serves as a somewhat novel foil for his victim which, in terms of horror, only adds to the unforgivingly palpable tension. Such bold narrative choices are numerous throughout Whannell's film, with one in particular proving instantly memorable.It could easily have been a bad case of eleventh-hour studio meddling, but with a horror veteran in the director's chair and a thoroughly convincing female lead, horror fans should know that this incarnation of The Invisible Man really needs to be seen."
1613,Great actress wauw. The movie was on point with the music üòÇ
1614,"Although trailer already tell the whole story, it's still keep me entertaining and intense throughout the whole time, totally no jumpscare but its keep u frightening through its camera view and Elisabeth Moss spendid performance.hope Elisabeth Moss will get a Oscar this year."
1615,"Although you know what's going to happen, there were good twists and jumps to keep you on edge. Worth a watch!"
1616,"THE INVISIBLE MAN (2020) was so good. Amazing acting, great directing, gripping score, and awesome pacing. A new horror classic is born! Can't wait to watch this again! So refreshing to see such a well made thriller.A+"
1617,"This film was a surprise, I was incredibly excited to find that each scene had a purpose and progressed the story further. If you let yourself fall into the rhythm of the movie you'll come to enjoy it, it's a slow burn with very shocking moments. Minor plot holes don't take away from the performances or story. Will watch again."
1618,"If you're a fan of the genre or you enjoy a blumhouse production go see this on the big screen. Don't wait untill the dvd is released. One of the best, intense films I've seen in the past few years. If I had to criticise, then I'd say it's a bit to long, should have wrapped it up in 100 mins."
1619,"When seeing the trailer numerous times leading up to its release in theaters, it led the impression that it was going to be another typical ""horror"" film, which had to include an old-school monster, in order to have some people in theaters. But, be as it may, this was a surprise, in terms of Blumhouse and the ""Dark World"" cinematic universe that would have died had this not been better than expected.First, Elizabeth Moss was the best actor in the film, being able to accurately portray herself as a battered woman, who have just (literally) escaped an abusive relationship from a sociopath. As the movie progresses, she begins to be losing it, as that's how everyone else sees it, refusing it believe what Cecilia was going through, being tormented by an invisible being at all times. Now, you could see this as typical of this kind of movie, OR this can be used as analysis for how victims of these types of relationships can traumatize them, making them believe that they're never really safe from their abuser. There's a scene where she ""talks"" to Adrian, asking him why did he choose her, stating that the sad reality of him being able to get with any girl, and she was the unlucky one. This might be giving them too much credit, but this is one thing to take away from the movie.Here's the biggest critic of the film that if you've seen the trailer, may have broken the illusion of the main antagonist of The Invisible Man: The Invisible Man. It has been building up this narrative, leading you to think that Adrain was the one who terrorized Cecelia, killed Emily, and kill a bunch of security guards in the second half of the movie. But, it turned out to be his brother that was doing all this. Gasp! And the way they went about it, explaining how he became invisible, albeit clich√©, it was a way to modernize the old tale. But, the main issue was that they chose to reveal it in the trailer, spoiling the dynamic of whether or not there was ever any Invisible Man in the first place! It could have just gone with showing Cecilia being seen as crazy, leading both the cast and viewers to think she was just imagining all this, until The Invisible Man actually revealed himself. It seemed they were trying to go that way, as evident by him making cecelia look like he attacked James' daughter. But, the moment you finish seeing the trailer, you knew that- oh, he IS real. Wow. He looks dumb.Still, this review is to NOT discourage you from seeing this movie, it's more of a warning to avoid trailers at ALL TIMES! If I had never seen it, or if they had done a MUCH better job in making it present itself as a thriller, then the intensity and themes of the supernatural would have been retained."
1620,"I enjoyed watching this movie, but there were many issues along the way that just don't add up. There are also excellent moments in the film which are accompanied by a nice haunting score, yet it seems overly loud at points and for no significant reasons. It's worth the watch, but you'll need to try and overlook a multitude of plot holes."
1621,"The invisible man concept is creepy AF, but it also buckled under the weight of of it's sci-fi thriller origins.This modern day interpretation embraces FULLY the emotions of a woman that has been beaten, completely controlled, possibly raped, then gaslighted (was gaslit??) and terrorized throughout the rest of the movie. Step by step, through her eyes, being terrorized. Always terrorized.No other point of view is brought into the story. I left the movie still vaguely unaware of how some of the people in it had anything to do with the main character or her life. When the main antagonist showed up he looked random and strange.Elizabeth Moss did a great job of looking miserable and scared throughout the movie and Aldis Hodge did a good job of looking incredibly nice. Those are the 2 good things I can think to say. None of the story made any real sense.Other than that, this is not a movie for intelligent people, The story was flat out disrespectful to it's original scifi origins, but I can see it being okay for folks who like movies that invoke feeling."
1622,"Cecilia believes that her ex husband, who's a renowned optics expert, created a way to turn invisible, haunt her and ruin her life. Obviously no one believes her so she takes it upon herself to prove it.This movie was a wild ride. You didn't really know what to expect. I was apprehensive at the beginning because I don't like horror movies at all and I'm not for cheap scares. However, I love thriller. Thus, I wouldn't really consider this movie to be horror, it's not ""scary"" per se. There are no cheap scares. It's a thriller pretty much.A thriller that deals with delusions and mental-illness, specifically bipolar. Some symptoms of schizophrenia are there because everyone thinks she's imagining it. I have a problem with this movie, though. It spoils itself in the description. ""After staging his own suicide, a crazed scientist uses his power to become invisible to stalk and terrorize his ex-girlfriend.""I believe this movie would be way better if we didn't know what was happening and tried to decide that for ourselves, there might a huge plot twist element there. Moreover, this movie exposes itself way too early as well. Lastly, this movie tries to do a plot twist but fails miserably as the plot twist was very predictable, weak and serves no purpose. Overall, good movie."
1623,"To say The Invisible Man starts out slow would be generous. Slow and tension building is crucial though. The characters who will play this out however are shortly in place. By this rather slow building the story of a woman escaping a manipulative partner comes into view. Not that unconventional. This will change of course.Elisabeth Moss turns in another nuanced performance as Cecilia Kass, a woman who must be free of her heavy handed boyfriend the brilliant, and rich, genius technologist Adrian Griffin. Griffin isn't giving up on having Cecilia however as he will use any means. And, due to his secret development in human cloaking he can pretty much resort to extreme measures. These measures will include a big ""red herring"" of his own suicide as well as the use of his own brother. This will further help Adrian as he resorts to some depraved revenge in addition to his wicked manipulation. The viewer is on a ride and it's not exactly clear at times who is pulling the dark strings. A good thing for the viewer as you must keep your concentration on what comes next.This is at times excellent drama, but it's a horror movie for sure. Not Sci-Fi or paranormal, pure horror. As such it really rises up to good level in a genre that is all over the place. Elisabeth Moss is by far the on screen reason it succeeds after what I'd say is an excellent screenplay. It could have went toward camp and never does and she is a constant keeping the fear and uncertainty of it all right where is needs to be. Her character even pulls off the ultimate ending that is in no way a let-down. If you've been hoping for some good horror that you only question in the right ways then this is your movie."
1624,"(sort of a) Spoiler Alert!!I knew two things from the TV trailers. First, I wanted to see this movie. Second, this was not Claude Rains in goggles and bandages.
With an opening, I'm tempted to call it a tracking scene, as engaging as ""Double Jeopardy"", it was fairly easy to tell where this story was coming from but it took a while to see where it was going.
Again, I had suspicions from the trailers that there was a good amount of Bergman/Boyer ""Gaslight"" to be burned but completely missed the Audrey Hepburn/Richard Crenna ""Wait Until Dark"" connection. Once it got me (or I got it), I completely understood all the open floorspace in the kitchen.
Expected plot twists and strong support from Harriet Dyer make this movie well worth a matinee ticket. You won't feel bad paying full price if you're big on Elizabeth Moss but you might feel cheated on the big unresolved issue at the end."
1625,Just went to see this movie. It's an OK film. There are some plot holes that dont make sense. If you ignore this it is an OK film to see
1626,"""The invisible Man"" starring Elizabeth Moss tells a cunning and terrifying story about a woman Cecilia who is haunted by her ex-husband Adrian. At first, I thought that Adrian actually committed suicide and haunts Cecilia as a ghost or spirit. As the story progressed, it was revealed that Adrian is in fact alive and used his tech invention to haunt Cecilia. The costume which is made completely out of surveillance cameras was insanely creepy and sent shivers down my spine.This horror movie didn't have a shortage of jump scares. In fact, I remember quite vividly how I jumped up frighteningly in multiple scenes. Despite the movie having a small budget (7 million USD), it did not disappoint and left me in a precarious place.The opening title card of the movie was quite awesome. Granted, it was short and unimportant, but made the movie a tiny bit more intriguing for me.Elizabeth Moss shines in this movie. She portrayed her character Cecilia perfectly. The actress perfectly encapsulates the character's mannerisms, facial expressions, feelings of insecurity and paranoia and the emotional pain of having been in a abusive relationship. I'm guessing quite a few women and perhaps men can relate to her character and understand her frustrations.To conclude, this movie had a compelling plot and the twists were surprising and unprecedented. The final scene was a little anticlimactic, but still satisfying. ""The Invisible Man"" is a great horror flick to watch on the big screen, as it has plenty of jump scares and quite a disturbing and gruesome scene halfway through the middle act."
1627,I am thrilled from the beginning until the last second of this movie over and over again. We can be sure this is going to be remembered as one of the great thriller movies of all time
1628,"I remember the old Invisible Man film wherein it focuses on how the scientists experiments the titular antagonist and everything goes wrong once the villain has taken control over them. In this 2019 remake, it delves into a different story which follows Cecilia, played by Elizabeth Moss, as she feels paranoid when she thinks her ex-boyfriend is stalking her. What's stressful about this is that everyone close to her doesn't believe it and therefore conclude that she might be going crazy.I had enough of horror films once the start of January began as The Grudge, Brahms: The Boy II and Fantasy Island were all released and did not satisfy me that much due to their lack of story, tone and paranoia. However, 2020's The Invisible Man did not disappoint me at all and made me thought about the theme of the film more than its horrific sequences that all come into play. The film is symbolical and included a very serious topic that people should understand: the effect of an abusive relationship.Because of the main theme that was idealized by the film production, Leigh Whannel's direction made every scene of the film as horrific as ever and terrifying to see how Moss's character struggles in keeping her sanity while also confronting the man who abused her in the past. I could only imagine how hard it was for Cecilia to overcome this trauma, knowing that even she found freedom, the sense of vengeance from Adrian will always be stuck in her mind. I also loved how the team made it so realistic in some of Cecilia and the Invisible Man's fighting sequences with one another.The third act of the film becomes quite a punch as Cecilia tries to discover the identity of the Invisible Man and figure out how to stop it once and for all. It kind of reminds me a horror action scene like The Matrix and The Shining was combined into a bloody and horrific massacre. Also, the third act is actually has the most intriguing twists I could have expected as it explains everything from start to finish.Although this is just the first quarter of 2020, I'd say that The Invisible Man is a very entertaining and better horror film than the lacklusters released. I was very hapoy as to how the story turned out and Elizabeth Moss's performance should deserve a lot of credit in her terrific role as the paranoid protagonist. If you are looking for a good horror film, then try giving The Insible Man a shot."
1629,"A nice scary movie with jump scares, sure you can point out plot holes but name a great horror movie that you can't. Loses a bit of pacing half way through but manages to find it again, and the ending is a bit disappointing but by no means as bad as the GOT finale. Tune in switch your brain off and get freaked out"
1630,"The best way to approach Leigh Whannell's THE INVISIBLE MAN is to forget about H.G. Wells' novel and most of the prior film adaptations from James Whale's 1933 masterpiece on down. The one exception is 2000's HOLLOW MAN which, aside from its Oscar nominated SFX is most remembered for Director Paul Verhoeven's perceived misogyny (a charge which has followed much of his career). Here, writer-director Whannell has reversed the POV and he imagines it all from the perspective of the invisible antagonist's female victim.Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) escapes from Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen; the character name being one of the few things carried over from the Wells novel). She hides out at the home of a friend James (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). But, as he had promised/threatened - Griffin tracks her down. Structurally, the screenplay follows the spousal abuse/stalker/revenge playbook to a T. In many ways it doesn't matter if Griffin is 'visible' or not.What makes it work is Whannell's Direction, Moss' fine performance and the controlled creepy camerawork of Cinematographer Stefan Duscio. To their credit, the filmmakers don't overtly cheat. We see what the characters see (credit also to editor Andy Canny). The one miscalculation is Benjamin Wallfisch's loud over-the-top score which is far too overwhelming for what is essentially a low key melodrama. The special effects are relatively minimal, but well handled.THE INVISIBLE MAN is a moderately effective thriller. Layering on a sci-fi horror angle on what is a serious theme of domestic abuse is more questionable (indeed, a version where The Invisible Man doesn't even exist except in Cecilia's mind could easily be created with fairly minimal editing). That is something for each viewer to evaluate. Setting that aside for now, the movie works."
1631,"Okey, I just loved it! The begining of the movie was perfect. The tension is kept throught all the movie. Actors, I think, did a great job too. And music wow was really dramatic. Probably all the scary scenes were because of it.
Of course you know that everything will be fine at the end but what interests me most is how are they going to reach that because it already seems to be a doomed situation."
1632,"H.G. Wells' science-fiction story of the man who becomes all invisible was first published in 1897 and has had many facelifts and adaptations to this enthralling conception. Many have imitated Mr. Wells' legacy in all manner of saga and concept that have run along this timeline of science-fiction endeavour.Writer and director of this contemporary adaptation of invisibility is brought to the big-screen by Mr. Leigh Whannell and it is more to the point of, throughout the years, how one justifies its uses and wants. Mr. Whannell has, here, seen to have gone for the psychological abuse and violent domestic perspective, and particularly toward female-dominance through the act of bullying and oppression of self-worth and ego. Could this simply be a case of a metaphorical viewpoint of mental torment seen through the eyes of this wretched soul due to a vain, malevolent man or a more sinister case of jealous lover cum exploitive, mad scientist?We lay bare the facts that whatever the premise for the torture and madness this is most definitely a tale of both.Ms. Elisabeth Moss' exemplary and unmitigated portrayal of the abused and Mr. Whannell's rendering of the old classic science-fiction fable here comes Vis-√†-vis with the expos√© of a chilling and somewhat disturbing insight into the world of paranoia and exploitation. The experience witnessed is wild and tense throughout and with each passing moment the intensity of doubt and reasoning becomes a visual nightmare for both recipient and viewer. Each tell-tale sign playing on the mind of the protagonist; looking but never seeing; present but never being. A downward and inward spiral sets the tone of an antagonist that drives this bitter battle to its central core; control, or simply addressing the element of losing control. A fine paradox of vision with the insight of Director to envisage a cruel world that is more often heard but never seen.The Invisible Man is a scolding parable of two worlds that collide and intertwine with love & hate. This shrouded rendition shows the scathing contempt of personal space, dignity and respect. It is a train wreck of nerves and bitter sweet retaliation that holds its breath until its final gasp; we are eyewitness to a high-octane and sensational amalgamation of a modern disease via the workings of Mr. Wells' original concept with a stellar performance of its leading lady. This is quite the optical illusion of less-is-more."
1633,"This film has been gaining plenty of traction in this last week so I decided to go watch The Invisible Man and this is my review of the film. The premise of the film sees a woman recieve a huge amount of money from an abusive ex, but she believes he might not be as dead as believed.
Main Character
Elisabeth Moss plays the lead character in this film and she is excellent in this role, you really are rooting for her in the film and you want to see her succeed. However, there is some depth to her character and some moral shades of grey that make her fascinating to watch and a great lead character. Also she delivers a great acting performance as plenty of her scenes are on her own and she does a great job in selling the premise of the film.
Supporting Characters
Aldis Hodge plays her friend in this film and I really liked his character in the film, he is very likeable to watch and I thought he had really good chemistry with Moss to truly build that friendship. Also his character goes through some interesting things in the film and it makes him a more memorable supporting Character. Michael Dorman plays her ex's brother and I thought he was very good in his role, he is very slimy in the role and every time he is on the screen he just makes you feel uncomfortable. Oliver Jackson-Cohen plays her Ex in the film and I just didn't really feel captivated by his character, she seems to think he is back alive but you don't really get enough to care about his character or his motivation against her in the film. Harriet Dyer plays her sister in the film and she really has nothing to her, you don't really learn enough about her to be interested in their relationship and how it affects Moss's character in the film.
Story
The story is really interesting, you see how Moss's character's life is affected by the death of her ex and this supposed Invisible Man. It is much more interesting then just your average slasher flick as you see this woman's whole life get put through hell by something that might not even be there. Also the ending of this film is really good, it feels appropriate for the film and gives the characters the ending that they all deserve, plus it also leaves some questions to ask and ways to interpret that ending.
Script
The script is great in this film, there isn't much humour in the film which is to be expected but the great dramatic dialogue makes up for it and really brings you into the characters and the plot, it makes you really interested in what is going on and care about the characters.
Style
The style of the film is incredibly suspenseful and thrillling, the film sucks you into the atmosphere and makes you feel the same way as Elizabeth Moss's character in the film and feeling scared as her. But like that this film is pretty slow and can drag a little bit at times and I kind of wish the plot moved a little bit faster so we could get to the more exciting bits a little bit quicker.
Overall
Overall this may be the sleeper hit of 2020, I was not expecting much going into this film but I had a great time with The Invisible Man, if you are a fan of thrillers and horror films then this is a film you should be seeing as soon as you can."
1634,Not to be a downer but I saw this movie today and I was able to see the man.
1635,"I really had no desire to check out the Blumhouse re-imaging of the classic Universal horror classic THE INVISIBLE MAN, but I was hearing positive comments on it - especially about the lead performance - so I figured I'd better check it out.And I'm glad I did. For this INVISIBLE MAN is taught and tense with (of course) a strong leading performance. And...it has something else...Intelligence.Originally, THE INVISIBLE MAN was supposed to be part of the ongoing Universal Studios ""Dark Universe"" series of films - Universal's answer to the Marvel Cinematic Universe or the DCEU - but when the first film in this series THE MUMMY tanked at the box office, Universal made a ""first look deal"" with Blumhouse Studios (makers of such low budget horror films as PARANORMAL ACTIVITY and THE PURGE) to make stand alone films with the classic Universal Studios characters.First up...THE INVISIBLE MAN...replacing Johnny Depp in the titular role and changing the focus of the film from THE INVISIBLE MAN to a woman (Elizabeth Moss) being harassed (or is she?) by THE INVISIBLE MAN.And...an inspired choice it is. I was surpirsed by the restraint and intelligence that Blumhouse - and Director Leigh Whanell (UPGRADE) - show with this material. Whanell ratchets up the tension and let's the audience sit in the uncertainty that the main character has.And...when that main character is performed as well as Elisabeth Moss (THE HANDMAID'S TALE), then it is 2 hours well worth your time. Moss' performance is the glue that holds this film together. If she isn't as good as she is in her role, then this film doesn't work. She is...and it does. Some say that she should earn an Oscar nomination for this work. I wouldn't quite go there (if any actress in a Horror film deserves an Oscar nomination, it would have been Lupita Nyong'o in US last year) but it is a very, very good performance.As is the performances of Harriet Dyer (as Moss' sister) and Aldis Hodge (as a friend of Moss' character). These two brought watch-ability, and believe-ability, to their characters and situations. And this is good for, if I'm to be honest, this film does fall down in the believe-ability factor. I have a tendency to turn that part of my brain off in these types of films, but there are HUGE plot holes and gaps in logic that I just couldn't ignore, which brought this film down a peg or so.As does the performance of Oliver Jackson-Cohen in the title role. I just didn't like what he was doing in this role, but fortunately, we don't see much of him (rim-shot).Overall, a pleasant enough surprise with an intelligence I wasn't expecting and a lead performance that is worth the price of admission.Letter Grade: B7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)"
1636,"Cecilia (known as ""C"") makes her escape from controlling husband Adrian, a wealthy scientist, world leader in optical research. She is terrified of Adrian finding her until he commits suicide, following which his lawyer brother executes the will, under which C inherits. But strange things happen afterwards. We, the audience, know the title of the film, but when C tells people that she believes Adrian is not dead but, instead, is invisible, people don't believe here.This film is dressed up in sci-fi/horror clothes, but it is actually a psychological thriller featuring a victimised woman set up to look as if she's crackers. To that extent, it is familiar territory. But, of its sort, it is quite well done.There is a lot to like here. Elizabeth Moss gives a good central performance of a woman who goes through a number of changes. The ending carries a pleasing element of uncertainty in the middle of a satisfactory resolution. The special effects are few, but effective. There are a couple of decent twists. And the first 10 minutes, dialogue-free, are an exemplary piece of cinematic story-telling - director and co-screenwriter Leigh Whannell (also responsible for the excellent first Saw film) can pat himself on the back."
1637,"The entire film up till the ending leaves you feeling trapped along side our protagonist, not knowing how to get out of the horrible situation she is in. Elisabeth Moss is outstanding in this film, nailing her performance."
1638,"Another great movie from the House of Blum- The Invisible Man is Enjoyable, Thrilling, full of suspense and tension, it has Genuine scares instead of Jump scares, Elizabeth Moss delivers a great performance. This movie is firing on all cylinders. The Invisible Man is a must-watch movie of the season."
1639,"""The Unseeable Descent into Madness""Leigh Whannell returns in full force after his visceral sci-fi darling, ""Upgrade"" (released in 2018) to reinvent the classic H.G. Wells novel for modern audiences in one of the most successful Universal Monster films we have seen in years. ""The Invisible Man (2020)"" is an intense thriller that will have you examining every corner of the frame as Whannell masterfully builds tension with every passing second. The film places Elisabeth Moss front and center as she leads the film and puts on a fantastic yet transformative performance that sees her falling deeper into the abyss of paranoia and trepidation. ""The Invisible Man (2020)"" is an exciting film that is not bound by Universal's haphazard decision of trying to create a disastrous shared monster universe (something Universal tried with ""Dracula Untold"" in 2014). This film is proof that eager visionaries can craft great works without the interference of lousy studio heads and executives. ""The Invisible Man (2020)"" stands as being the first truly must-watch film of 2020.
""The Invisible Man (2020)"" may share its name with H.G. Wells' original novel published in 1897, and Universal Pictures 1933 film adaptation, but that is where the similarities end. ""The Invisible Man (2020)"" opens with Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) as she quietly plans to escape the prison she calls ""home"" under the cover of night. Cecilia quickly gathers her belongings and desperately flees from her abusive and controlling millionaire boyfriend, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). Having run away, Cecilia contacts her sister, Emily (Harriet Dyer) and gets a ride from her to leave the area once and for all. Cecilia refuses to seek shelter with her sister for fear that Adrian may find them both due to him knowing Emily's home address. She decides to take refuge with an old friend, James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) who is now a police detective and his daughter Sydney Lanier (Storm Reid), a student wanting to make her mark in the fashion industry. However, Cecilia still fears for her life not knowing when or where Adrian may strike; so much so that she can hardly even step foot out of James' home. That is until Emily arrives at the Lanier residence and reveals to Cecilia that Adrian was found dead in his home due to a successful suicide attempt. Emily also notes that Adrian left in his passing five million dollars that are all to be paid out to her. Hearing the news, Cecilia is conflicted and becomes overwhelmed but a veil of relief washes over her prompting the next phase. Cecilia takes back control of her life and moves forward. Unfortunately, along the way, several instances of misfortune strike her life and Cecilia believes in the truth that Adrian is not actually dead at all. It is here where Cecilia begins spiraling out of control and those around her begin questioning her every move, all while she battles with trying to unmask the culprit behind the veil of the Invisible Man.
""The Invisible Man (2020)"" is a project that Leigh Whannell was intimately attached to. Whannell not only worked behind the camera as the film's director, he also penned the original screenplay, and acted as an executive producer behind the film. It should be stated that without Whannell's close proximity and handling of ""The Invisible Man (2020)"", this film would not be what it is. Given the subject matter, is it clear that Whannell had a specific approach to the directing of this film; he had a distinct vision he wanted to execute. Going into a screening of ""The Invisible Man (2020)"" the audience is already privy to the fact that whoever or whatever the threat may be, we will never fully be able to see it. Whannell takes this information and perfectly plays on that individual fear by ratching up the tension in every scene. Whannell does this by applying a couple of impressive techniques. For starters, let us begin with Whannell's shot selection and camera movements. Throughout the entirety of ""The Invisible Man (2020)"", we as the audience are just as unsure of the threat's presence as Cecilia is. Our levels of immersion are locked in as Whannell will have actions occurring on-screen in one corner of the frame, but he slightly shifts the camera over to the uninhabited space where he holds it and lingers on the emptiness until switching the focus back to the present action. This is a brilliant method at play that keeps our eyes scanning the entire scene as we attempt to spot a curtain slightly shift or find that an object has been displaced; we investigate closely as a means of gaining any kind of clue as to where this invisible being may be lurking. Another technique Whannell employs with the camera is his ""pov"" shifts. I put pov in quotes because we are never quite sure if we are looking through the Invisible Man's eyes, or just viewing the scene from a different perspective. We are positioned in empty doorways or down a hallway just beside a corner patiently watching character interactions unfold waiting to strike. These techniques have been used by scores of directors in the past and they will continue to be used until the end of time, but Whannell makes it work because the looming threat is never known to the characters or the audience.
Whannell not only works magic behind the camera as the film's director, but he also shines as the sole writer on this project. Taking an old classic and attempting to reboot it for mass audiences can be an extremely tough ask for many. Questions will rattle in the minds of both writers and directors as they try and figure out a way it can be done. Whannell took the hokey-wacky character of the Invisible Man from the '30s and '40s and found a way to reinvent him in a shocking way that takes a more modern approach. Whannell also takes the entire original narrative and turns it inside out opting to show how those affected by the crazed Invisible Man fall into insanity, rather than having us watch as the Invisible Man slowly rots into lunacy. Despite all of that being said, the greatest asset of the script is its well-fleshed out characters. From side characters like Sydney and Tom (Michael Dorman) to main ones such as Cecilia and James, every character is tended to with a great deal of care. No one is left behind or presented as a one-note pony that is there to serve a particular archetypal role; it is absolutely refreshing. Whannell's good character work is only bolstered by the cast, as everyone onboard delivers performances that are grounded in reality. No one plays their characters in an off the wall manner or comes across like a cartoonish exaggeration mimicking reality, which is fantastic, as it ensures the tone of the film persists. Yet, there is one performance that stands out from the crowd and it should come as no surprise that the honor is given to lead actress herself, Elisabeth Moss. Moss works wonders with Whannell's script as she allows the audience to feel the dread collapsing upon her with every passing moment. When she frantically searches a room for her invisible predator or must plea with those around her for help, Moss does so in such a manner that will you wondering how she pulled it off. From her line delivery to physical presence, Moss delivers a stellar performance that is equal parts emotional as it is terrifying. We hold her hands as we dive down a deep well of panic.
""The Invisible Man (2020)"" is a film that takes the classic H.G. Wells story and adapts it through a contemporary lens of reality to great success. With Whannell's exciting script and brilliant direction, he perfectly reinvents the tale of the Invisible Man in a way that will have audiences questioning their own vision. With exceptional character development that allows every performer (both major and minor) to deliver good performances across the board to unsettling shots that will leave you questioning, ""The Invisible Man (2020)"" is a suspense thriller that exceeds the bland staples the genre has been plagued with for years. That is why, all of these attributes and more make ""The Invisible Man (2020)"" this year's (this decade's) first must-watch film.Final Verdict: A"
1640,"This film throws you in at the deep end right from the start of the film, as the tension is unbearable. What struck me was the lengths her abuser will go to to control her, keep her close, assuage his own issues by projecting them on to her and I know some people would suggest that it's far fetched. But I worked with survivors of interpersonal violence (aka domestic violence) and their stories echo much of what this protagonist goes through. We once had a guest speaker who had survived 24 years of stalking after she left her wealthy boyfriend when he tried to control her with his substantial wealth. He'd never experienced anyone leaving him before and he bugged her phones by bribing a bt engineer, bought the flat opposite hers, discredited her profession by circulating fake stories online, (she was a self employed writer) bribed her closest friends to give him information and the list went on and on. His goal was to financially ruin her to force her to return to him, and eventually she had no choice but to live in a caravan and move every two weeks! This film highlights how abusers encourage the victims supporters to question her sanity, label her as hysterical, become fatigued and give up on her. Often society doesn't acknowledge the constant pressure and stress the victims experience and the damage it causes.abusers take advantage of this apathy, or ignorance and they just need a different kind of visibility: an absence of scrutiny. As far as they're concerned, a man you aren't looking at might as well be an invisible one. Terrific film and expertly executed."
1641,"I really enjoyed the film, the violence and emotional abuse was very realistic if you or a partner have been the victim of an emotional or physical relationship / domestic abuse I would think very carefully about watching the film or go with someone you can talk to afterwards as it's very powerful and may stir up memories or incidents in a dark place. I did enjoy the film well acted well made and kept me on the edge of my seat so it's worth a 10 out of 10"
1642,"The theme instantly reminds me of the Babadook and the plastification of it in a more modern sense of how the hermetic seal is placed on the psyche of the opposite is barely okay. I really enjoyed how the movie plot falls together with its manifold leitmotifs, like the ladder or the two suits. However, it's to simple just like it's acting (besides Elisabeth Moss who did a fairly good job imo) and poorly used CGI in 2020. It's a movie you watch once, nothing more to say to it.I only went into this movie given that IMDB gave it a 7.7Ouch... Overrated but I can see how things change when David Fincher is being represented as the ""Director of Gone-Girl"" in his involvement in The Women in the Window."
1643,"The CGI was definitely close to PS4 graphics which isn't too bad, but it's noticable because one scene the knife moves like it's being controlled by VR lol! There wasn't too much horror or anything scary, mostly good atmosphere, kinda spooky, and a little bit of needless comedy...this is definitely a general public SciFi Thriller Horror film you could take your grandma too...I almost fell asleep in a good way tho... It's a slow burn. I went in seeing the movie completely blind with high expectations but man some of the acting is bad as well. I didn't overall get the hype? I watched the trailer after the film and the trailer showed the entire film!
Lol good thing I didn't see any clips because the trailer was actually better than the film itself. Well I guess I was expecting for a woman to be thrown around and beaten while being stalked by an actual Invisible guy wreaking havoc through the city...There was havoc but not exactly, lastly I thought there was supposed to be a shower scene? Maybe I missed it."
1644,"It is a good movie that could have been great.Elisabeth Moss is a hell of an actor but I can't keep thinking why she plays always the same kind of roles.Being trapped in abusive relationships, dystopian or cults. Sounds familiar?Is she trying to say that The Invisible Man is L. Ron Hubbard? Can someone check on her before she ends up like Shelly?Ok, so the movie.I feel let down. All the elements for a great horror/thriller were there, I just hate the ending.The movies I love the most are the ones when I can't wait to get home from the theater to read other people's comments and discuss the movie.I wish this movie were 30 minutes shorter and things were left open ended.Was there an Invisible Man or was she psychotic and suffering from severe PTSD? That would have been amazing.At the middle of the movie I thought that that were where things were heading but it didn't end and it kept going and going to a very clich√© and predictable finale.I feel so disappointed. It was meh. No space to discuss it or to contemplate other theories. Nothing.I loved Upgraded from the same writer/director, also a fantastic movie with a terrible ending.I can't speak for more of his work but Leigh Whannell needs to take some time and figure out how to end his movies without these cheap clich√©s endings.Funny enough, SAW was a fantastic movie with a fantastic ending. The Saga is mostly crap but that first movie was amazing in every possible way.That ending was legendary."
1645,The last slice of the neck was surprising but when I thought about it I don't think it would be possible. If somebody grabbed my arm to slash my own throat I'm pretty sure I would have instantly resisted with vigor. That part didn't seem realistic.
1646,"For starters, Elizabeth Moss gives a bravura performance but you expect her to do so. She's simply one of the best at her craft. And she almost saves the film based on the strength of her portrayal.
The trouble is the film lacks a cohesive logic and exists simply to manufacture numerous scenes that while exciting fall apart if given any thought.
I really thought I would enjoy this more. Not bad but not great. I wish i had waited until I could stream it."
1647,"After I watched the trivial, I noticed that some of scenes don't exist in the Turkish version. I don't want to give spoilers here, but during the movie I remarked some scenes not persuasive, especially murdering ones."
1648,"My big problem was with the logic of this film. There are two scenes in a restaurant and hospital that would've proved the main characters innocence only if they had security cameras (which they 100% would've in 2020). Another illogical part of this movie was the ending. It just felt rushed and not creative at all, it actually was so bad and cliche it got cringey imo. The last thing that bothered me was that the relationship between the family that the protagonist was staying with was never explained. I didn't need a deep explanation because that's not what the movie was about but if you're going to put it in our face's explain a little more. Like why were the cop and attorney separated? Why doesn't their daughter live with her mom? Why would the attorney let her sister stay under the same roof as her ex husband and not with her? Why does the attorney never really interact with her daughter? If you can look past some minor holes then you should still check it out. This movie did more things right than bad in my opinion."
1649,"This is the most lose adaptation of The Invisible Man that I've ever seen. If you're looking for a horror movie, this isn't it, the feel is more of a Lifetime thriller about domestic abuse. The plot isn't really that suspenseful and is sort of comedic. The reason why Elizabeth Moss ""Cecila's"" husband has the ability to be invisible and the way that it plays out is stupid. If you were the head of an optic company and had this ability, would you really waste your time harassing your ex wife? Don't waste your time."
1650,"The movie wasn't bad, but it was generic. It started rather solid, but quickly devolved once the horror elements entered the picture. There was one moment in particular where, for no apparent reason, a jump scare was accompanied by a Generic Horror Monster Scream #3.What the film does really well is use the medium of film. That's only enough to bump up it's quality a little bit in my mind, but it is still good. The camera lingers on empty space or even turns away from the main character to watch an empty room. This builds suspense and leaves the audience wondering if the room is really empty - if there's something malevolent in the void.All in all, not bad, but not a knock out."
1651,"This film is like a good poltergeist movie without all of the hokey pokey nonsense.
The invisible man has seen so many different adaptations over the years and most of them were mediocre. This was the best horror film I've seen for a while, which in itself is not great praise but I watch almost every horror film that is released.
I've given it an eight because it loses a couple of points just by not quite being as creepy as it could be, you can kind of guess what's happening right from the start but it doesn't really detract from the movie."
1652,"The theme of invisible has been brought after (Hollow man, 2020) In the past, it focused how character became wicked when had the ability of invisibility. But this time it describes how character live in dread of being controlled and stalked.In the past special effect on invisibility was that skin, muscles, and vessels gradually became invisible, to emphasize the fail of experiment in human invisibility which cannot be reversed. And this time it's like an invisible armour which is fast invisible and strong.The acting of Cecilia, (Elisabeth Moss) is awesome no matter she plays as a victim that being haunted by control-freak boyfd or as a rebel to prove she isn't crazy. Some shooting frames is required her to act and imagine someone is standing at the corner, stalking her or to act like she is punched in midair.Two blockings are great:May question Cecilia's sanity because she keeps taking an anti-anxiety drug called Diazepam, and all controls or stalks are never mentionedMay confused the invisible man is brother Adrian or Tom but at last it can be figured out by a word of Surprise"
1653,See the movie for Elizabeth Moss. She is awesome in her role. The movie is unique in its ability to run in the thin line between a horror and a sci-fi thriller.
1654,"I'm so happy that I watched the Super Bowl this year! because as soon as I saw the commercial for this movie, I perked up with total excitement! I took my daughter to see the movie This pass Sunday and right when some action was peeking... the fire alarm went off and we had to leave. We returned yesterday to finish the film and seeing the first half again still had us at the edges of our seats! When I read the synopsis on Fandango, I thought that it ruined the plot of the film but, that wasn't close to being true at all! Having seen a few titles with the same concept, This Invisible Man stood out by far. I absolutely loved the storyline, shot choices, and cast. I am a fan of Elisabeth Moss after watching her performance in this film, she was the perfect choice to convey what the character was experiencing. Some of the major plot twists in this movie were unforeseen and really put this film at the top of my list! The only thing that had me a bit unfulfilled was some of the character's backstories and relationships with each other. Overall, I was really happy about how this movie had hooked me from beginning to end and kept me on the edge of my seat. My kid said she heard that they were working on the next one...I don't personally see how that would happen but, after being blown away from the plot twists, I won't be surprised."
1655,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)As you should know by now, I avoid trailers at all costs, especially for highly anticipated movies. I'm careful enough already, but once I heard the massive complaints about the trailer for The Invisible Man, I made sure to not even listen to it, let alone see something from it. My expectations got higher as the release date approached, and the overwhelmingly positive reactions reached my attention, so obviously, I couldn't help but get excited. I love The Handmaid's Tale, and I always thought it was a matter of time until Elisabeth Moss brought her phenomenal acting skills to the big screen. She just needed a big film to do it...And this is the one. Elisabeth's performance is yet another horror display for The Academy to ignore when the year comes to a close. In comparison to Hereditary's Toni Colette or Us' Lupita Nyong' o, I admit that I would give an Oscar to one of these two over Moss. However, this is one of the main issues I have when people compare things from different years: it's extremely unfair and a bit irrational. Something ""great"" in a specific year can be just ""okay"" in the next one. It depends on each year's quality regarding movies and their cast's performances.If Moss truly ends up delivering the best interpretation of the year, she should receive recognition independently of other year's injustices. With that said, based on my experience, I firmly believe Elisabeth Moss should be one of the contenders for the respective category during the awards season. I'm not saying she should be nominated or not, I'm saying that she should be one to think of when it's time to fill the ballot with the nominees. She is relentlessly exceptional during the whole runtime. There isn't a single moment where she drops her level. Impressive!Regarding the story, it's probably the best adaptation of The Invisible Man to the actual world that they could have done. Of all the meaningful and sensitive real-world themes, Leigh Whannell chose the very best to insert in his film. Domestic violence and abuse is a tremendously serious topic, and Whannell addresses it perfectly. It's a remarkably clever screenplay, with tons of tiny little details that relate in some shape or form to the real-life situations a lot of people (women AND men, let's not pretend this is an exclusively female problem) go through.It's one of the best horror movies I've seen lately when it comes to creating a suspenseful, scary environment, mostly based on something that feels incredibly realistic. Taking the sci-fi aspect of, well, dealing with an invisible person, the menacing silence and haunting score work as well as they do because I'm able to feel the protagonist's fear. Stefan Duscio's cinematography is one of the main reasons why this film is filled with so much efficient suspense. The camera constantly pauses on one side of the room the character's in, lingering on for some seconds, creating a certain doubt if something's moving or if someone's there.This point-of-view (POV) shot works exceptionally well for the whole movie. Being able to see what the main character is seeing, it's also possible to think what she's thinking and feel what she's feeling. That awkward, frustrating, unnerving, uneasy feeling that something's not right. Then, Whannell proves he knows his film's own weaknesses. When it starts to lose a bit of its entertainment value, and when the audience begins to get used to the long, suspenseful sequences (of which probably half, nothing happens), he hits the narrative with an unexpected, shocking turn of events in the most jaw-dropping way possible.This particular decision got the blood heavily pumping again, and it delivered the energy I needed to be at the edge of my seat until the very end. However, the ending is a tad underwhelming, and maybe a bit over-the-top concerning some character's decisions. I can't really get into spoiler territory, so I'll just write I don't really think that the last scene is very coherent with everything the movie showed until that point. Even though I understand and respect this narrative decision, I don't believe its message is the one the film wanted to transmit. Good performances from the rest of the cast, a few character's decisions are a bit hard to believe, but I don't want to be nitpicky.In the end, The Invisible Man deserves all the hype it's been getting. Leigh Whannell crafted a genuinely scary and extremely suspenseful horror movie, based on a traumatic real-life situation that a lot of people, unfortunately, go through. Elisabeth Moss delivers an emotionally powerful performance, demonstrating all of her impressive acting abilities which are probably going to be ignored when the awards season comes around (the usual horror genre bias). Incredibly well-written, intelligent screenplay, supported by some terrific camera work by Stefan Duscio. The haunting score from Benjamin Wallfisch is also a standout, especially when it chooses to be completely silent. I'm not a fan of the slightly incoherent ending since some character/narrative decisions seem hard to believe, and the final message didn't really have the meaning it should. Nevertheless, it's one of the best films of the year so far, so don't miss it!Rating: A-"
1656,"The Invisible Man requires more than the occasional suspension of disbelief, but an original story with legitimately tense moments elevate it to the top of its genre. The characters often fall into classically poor horror movie decision-making, but it's not enough to take away from the overall impact of the film."
1657,"A fantastic, almost silent opening sets the tone for a remarkably assured 'monster movie', one that's leagues above 'The Mummy (2017)' and proves that stand-alone filmmaking is still the best bet for Blum's reboots. Whannell last impressed with 'Upgrade (2018)', the sci-fi sleeper hit that saw a newly crippled man seek revenge with the help of an advanced spinal implant, and he continues to do so here. While 'The Invisible Man (2020)' isn't quite as entertaining as that previously mentioned title, it's certainly more confident. It has a distinct, compelling style and doesn't feel the need to conform to its genres. Its story is delightfully modern, being steeped in thematic relevance and undeniable subtext. It takes the unconventional horror of everyday gas-lighting, essentially, to its next logical step. Just like how 'Hereditary (2018)' sought to convey the terror of grief, this seeks to convey the terror of abuse. So rarely is this aspect considered and it fits hand-in-glove with the source material. Led by an astounding lead performance from Moss, the piece continuously wows with nuanced storytelling, slow-burn scares and all-out action. It's unconventional and, even, somewhat unpredictable. It's also just very well made. The thing doesn't slow down for a second, pushing forward at its own pace until it reaches an unexpected final confrontation. It's by turns suspenseful, frustrating, horrific, intriguing, pulse-pounding and heart-stopping. This is the sort of stuff Universal should put its backing behind. It's compelling, considered and incredibly entertaining. It doesn't treat its audience like idiots, either. 8/10"
1658,"'The Invisible Man' is probably about the 10th remake of one of the original sci-fi/monster concepts, coming 87 years after the original film. Thankfully, it's a very modern take, with no supernatural elements - just a well put together thriller. Cecilia (Moss) basically carries the film, and it starts with her escaping her controlling husband, Adrian (Jackson-Cohen), with the help of her sister, Emily (Dyer). She stays with their friend James (Hodge) and his daughter, Sydney (Reid), when she finds out that Adrian is dead.With all apparently fine, things start to unravel, as Cecilia starts to believe Adrian is somehow stalking her from beyond the grave. Adrian's brother, Tom (Dorman) assures Cecilia that Adrian's dead. We're left guessing, as we don't get much insight into Adrian & Cecilia's relationship or his motives, other than the fact he's a Tony Stark-type rich inventor. This is where the idea of the invisibility coming from a high-tech suit is more plausible than supernatural powers.After the great, almost-silent and very dark, start, the film establishes a good rhythm, until it kicks into overdrive for the final 30min or so. The tension, suspense and guessing ""where is he?"" throughout is handled really well, with it never getting too boring or predictable. There's certainly a few really good jump scares! Better than 'Hollow Man', which I also liked, at least when it came out."
1659,"This is indeed a great movie. I liked it. My expectations were high and I was fully satisfied after watching it. The story is good, acting is excellent, soundtrack is very good, cinematography is good and the twist is unexpected...The movie starts immediately with the main story without any boring setups. The movie respects itself and do NOT use any cheap materials like unnecessary sex or nudity just for attracting more audience. It is serious from the beginning to the end. It caught my attention all the time. Never got bored and what a shocking ending!I didn't give this movie 10 because it has some minor plot holes. But those holes never damage a wonderful movie like this. I recommend it."
1660,"I wanted to like this film so much. But there were too many unanswered questions.. I love Elisabeth Moss, I think she is a great actress but it was like watching the same character in "" The Handmaids tale"".Its really sad that you watch a whole film where you are supposed to understand and have empathy for the main character but I was only interested in the dog, what happened to the dog, and whether the dog was ok.I left the cinema with so many questions - Why, why, why??? I woke up the next morning still asking the same questions. It wasn't a bad film.. it just wasn't that good. Don't watch the trailer, it shows you all the best bits. When that happens you know it isn't going to be good.I am so disappointed.. why was the dog living in the house alone????!!!! who was feeding it???!!!!!!! How did she get dressed so quickly? how did she know how to use the outfit/thingie???!!! so many questions :("
1661,"REVIEW - THE INVISIBLE MANRemakes, prequels and sequels when will it ever stop?There have been great remakes, prequels and sequels,There have terrible remakes, prequels and sequels,There have also been countless remakes of films and TV series based on the classic HG Wells story of a man turning invisible and so many spin offs with teen comedies is this recent remake any good?Basically it's the story of a woman who escapes an abusive relationship, the person she is in a relationship with just happens to be a scientist working on an invisibility suit.The film does brings the subject crashing into the present with the subject of the abusive relationship and the use of an invisibility suit rather than some magic potion or spell.The film its self is certainly enjoyable but personally I (in places) just felt it was silly, let me explain.Watching this I knew straight from the off that the brother was involved but I did question why the inheritance was left her after the apparent suicide, this actually served no real part of the film its self and didn't add anything to the plot other than to introduce the brother which could have been done in an alternative way that could have been more menacing, for example him trying to get with our heroin, but doing so for other reasons?Acting was very good and believable especially when the characters interacted with the invisible man himself, but there was one big let-down which I just can't let go.At the end, the sheer speed our heroin gets changed (no spoilers), at first when I saw this I thought it was another invisible person / man / woman but, which was actually confusing at first.Not a bad remake, not the best and could have been better if initially it wasn't automatically know it was him who was invisible.The film could have taken a completely different track with her being haunted and the invisible man at the end.Rating 7 out of 10"
1662,"""The Invisible Man"" is clever, creepy, manipulative, tension-filled and will have you feeling unsettled throughout.
.
In this horror film, when her abusive husband takes his own life, a woman discovers bizarre occurrences and begins to wonder if he's really dead. Based on the novel by H.G. Wells.
.
Not only is ""The Invisible Man"" a great film, but it uses its source material to adapt to our times and makes for a solid revenge flick. Elisabeth Moss is really impressive in this role that will become a career best for the actress. Writer/director Leigh Whannell carefully crafts his film and takes his time to make you feel the most uncomfortable in every way possible, especially in empty spaces. ""The Invisible Man"" could be the start of a new era of modern monsters films.

Follow @snobmedia for more reviews!"
1663,"Well worth the money.
I see lot of reviews comparing it to the original. I've never seen the original so I thought this was great.
The only thing I didn't like was that the fight scenes (against the invisible Man) were unrealistic. There was a twist and plenty of things happening that I did not expect.
I'll stop there before I give too much away.
I will be watching again when it hits Redbox!"
1664,"""The invisible man"" has an interesting, though not new, argument, a good direction and good performances, but Leigh Whannell's feature still owes.The script of the feature is of constant ups and downs, we have a lot of development that ends up going around in itself, a rhythm that weighs and a monotonous first act, a lack of objectivity in the cinematographic style permeates the whole work, the positive side of the script is the creation of the device created and the argument for its use, are at least creative.The direction of the film is good, it mixes several elements of direction and uses his camera very well, making him a character, since we do not see the villain, the camera manages to give a weight and dimension to his threatening presence. Elisabeth Moss is really the highlight of the film, the actress manages to give a great dramatic depth to her character and express her terror very well, it is almost at odds with the rest of the work.When we watch ""The invisible man"", which is a remake, we see hints of other films, such as ""The dark man"" or ""The accountant"", nothing very surprising, a first act that is hard to pass, and a third more animator. Grade 6/10"
1665,"The Invisible Man gets 7/10 and 2üëçüèªüëçüèª Beautifully shot and well acted with 1 exception. Overall I loved it. The scares are great, music is great and it's visually stunning. Moss carries the film beautifully. Go see it in the theatre while you can!"
1666,The story line was easy to understand but it's not the best. This movie should of been played out as the invisible man the villain and not his ex as the victim. The quality in movies has definitely gone down.
1667,"First Hit: Despite Elizabeth Moss's excellent performance, the film dragged on.Moss, as Cecilia Kass, plays a wife that was being controlled by her husband, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), and is looking to escape his clutches.The story begins with Cecilia sneaking out of bed, packing some clothes, and sneaking out of the house. As she moves through the home and the surrounding property, we figure out that Adrian must be wealthy because the home is amazingly new, large and modern, and the walled-in yard is extravagant. There is also a quick blurb with someone saying he's done very well in the world of optical science.Cecilia's sister, Emily (Harriet Dyer), picks her up on an empty two-lane road near the home, and just as Emily attempts to ask why Cecilia is doing this, Adrian's fist comes through the window and tries to pull Cecilia out of the car. The two just escape his clutches and speed down the road.Cecilia gets dropped off at James Lanier's (Aldis Hodge) home. James is a police officer and lives with his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Cecilia feels safe there as we learn that her husband doesn't know about James or where he lives.Cecilia learns that Adrian has committed suicide, which, to Cecilia, seems out of character. Adrian's brother Tom (Michael Dorman) is the executor of Adrian's estate and tells Cecilia that she is to receive $5M in payments.However, strange things begin to happen to Cecilia, and she suspects that Adrian is still alive and invisible. This is the beginning of great acting by Moss to pretend this invisible person is stalking her while trying to convince others that her experiences are real. Yet, this is also where the film begins to wane because we just spend too much time, in different circumstances, watching Cecilia evading an invisible Adrian.We all know how it is going to end, so there is no surprise. However, the way it is handled by Cecilia is good and does add to the enjoyment of the overall film.I didn't think any of the relationships were well developed, which was disappointing. Don't know why Cecilia would even be with Adrian in the first place. Where did Cecilia and James know each other from? What was Tom and Adrian's relationship based upon? The film tried to make the audience believe what was said, but the over subservient way people acted with Adrian seemed out of character.Moss was excellent at portraying fear of an invisible person, and she showed this through her very expressive face. Hodge was wonderful as Cecilia's friend and protector. Dyer was perfect as Cecilia's sister in the way she was protective, questioned, and cared about her sister. Reid was terrific as James's daughter. Dorman was good as Adrian's subservient brother. Leigh Whannell wrote and directed this movie. The writing was good, but the story got old waiting for Cecilia (and the audience) to see Adrian and to get to the end. Part of the problem for me was the lack of character and relationship development.Overall: This film could have been better."
1668,"It's a shame that Tome Cruises' egotistical demands that made ""The Mummy"" such a chore to watch buried the Universal Studios ""Dark Universe"" project that would have updated all of their stable of 1930's movie monsters. Because if ""Invisible Man"" is an example of what they could have done, it would have been great.After suffering through the execrable ""Fantasy Island"" less than a week earlier, I am astounded to see that this movie was also a Blumhouse production. Talk about your uneven results! Where that film was stupid, boring, poorly-crafted, and tedious, ""Invisible Man"" was a taut and well-made movie, part sci-fi / horror, part psychological thriller. Seeing the protagonist ever more deeply ensnared by her invisible stalker's mind games, you'll find yourself wondering just how she'll prove her sanity in much the same way you wondered if Richard Kimble would prove his innocence in ""The Fugitive.""Add in a clever twist at the end, and this is a movie that is well worth your time and money."
1669,"This movie is getting good reviews but after seeing it I'm surprised the reviews aren't better. I went in with pretty high expectations and they were exceeded. The story is really interesting, it's well paced, I can't think of any extraneous scene. It evokes a certain type of terror that you don't see often and it really succeeds. I felt so much of what Elizabeth Moss' character was feeling thanks to her acting but also the directing really plays up the fear of the unknown and empty spaces. My muscles were sore afterwards because I was so tense the entire movie. The trailers definitely tell a lot but there is still a lot you won't expect so it didn't really spoil too much. Probably one of the most suspenseful movies I've ever seen. It's totally different in story, structure, and the type of fear, but I haven't had this kind of response to a movie, physically feeling real fear, since Hereditary."
1670,The thing that I got out of it was how fast the movie went by. The acting was good as was the suspense.
1671,"This is a proper psychological thriller / horror with a bit of science fiction mixed in. It is dark, jumpy and eerie throughout. A really good watch. There are a few gory moments but it's mostly full of suspence and curiosity. The science fiction part is believable and probable in the future. A great film."
1672,"The Invisible Man tells the story of Cecilia Kass(Elisabeth Moss). Cecilia's abusive ex-boyfriend Adrian Griffin(Oliver Jackson-Cohen), commits suicide. When extremely disturbing events happen more often, Cecilia believes that she is being stalked by someone she can't see.The Invisible Man is a mind-blowing film. Writer-director Leigh Whannell has given us a flawless & modern take, on H.G. Wells' iconic source material. This is is the first horror/thriller movie where you're on the edge of the seat, when there's absolutely no one on screen. This film has several creepy & terrifying moments that will keep you guessing, right till the end. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Elisabeth Moss is spectacular as Cecilia Kass. Moss portrays a wide range of emotions effortlessly, sometimes in a single scene. Oliver Jackson-Cohen is outstanding as Adrian Griffin. Harriet Dyer is awesome as Emily Kass. Aldis Hodge is fantastic as James Lanier. Storm Reid is excellent as Sydney Lanier. Michael Dorman is brilliant as Tom Griffin. The Invisible Man is a must watch for horror/thriller fans. Apart from the scares, this film gives us life lessons to learn, in a subtle way, throughout. Go, have a jaw-dropping time & disappear into the sheer magnificence of The Invisible Man!"
1673,"(MASSIVE SPOILERS)So after Universals Dark Universe died before it even got started, they have gone back to the drawing board updating their 'Classic Monsters'. The Invisible Man is not a Dark Universe movie (I doubt we will get any more), but Universal have made the right decision getting Blumhouse involved and to be honest, after this effort, that's what they should have done from the start. At the time of writing, the film has made three times its production budget back in a single day in the U.S alone.The Invisible Man is a classic case of awful trailer, incredible movie and updating it to a modern audience perfectly.Telling the story of Cecilia (played brilliantly by Elizabeth Moss) who from the start flees a very abusive and violent relationship to one Adrian Griffin who in turn is a genius in the field of optics. After being told Griffin has committed suicide, Cecilia feels free at last. However, once strange occurrences start happening while staying with a friend and her daughter, Cecilia comes to the conclusion that Griffin is still alive, is using his genius in optics and has made himself invisible. What happens from here is what makes the film is that, as well as Cecilia, we the audience also know what's happening but watching her being accused of horrendous things she hasn't done (including a shocking murder in the films best scene) is where this film excels. There is also a scene involving Adrians brother, who is also in on what is going on and explains that Cecilia is pregnant after swapping her birth control pills for something else. This is why Adrian refuses to actually kill Cecilia. Due to all this, we are just willing for Cecilia to fight back and wonder how she will clear her name, as well as stopping what Adrian is doing to her.The film ends where, in a twist and after a fight to the death, we find that it is actually Adrians brother who was The Invisible Man and he in turn claims he faked Adrians death and has imprisoned him at Adrians own home. Or did he?????? This is where the film excels in paranoia, but due to how strong the character of Cecilia is, she knows her husband and the sort of manipulator he is and she turns the tables on him using his own technology and getting her revenge.Leigh Whanell has just excelled himself here, after being involved with horror for quite some time now, especially with the brilliant Insidious series. The film he has directed here is beautifully shot, the San Francisco setting makes it more special, the cast are excellent and the icing on the cake is another great score from Benjamin Wallfisch. Even the tech used to bring the Invisible Man to life is grounded in reality to make it more believable.Horror is back in brilliant style at the moment and as mentioned, after the success of The Conjuring Universe, Insidious and now Halloween, Blumhouse, James Wan, Leigh Whanell et al should have been responsible for the Dark Universe from the get go. They know how to do horror brilliantly and The Conjuring 2 was the best horror film in years.The Invisible Man though was beyond what I thought it was going to be and if the ending of this film is anything to go by, The Invisible Woman will be next. I only hope Blumhouse oversee all the updates of Universals Classic Monsters going forward. Brilliant."
1674,"I just have to start by saying I can not hear the title of this movie without having the Queen song stuck in my head for the next few hours. I just had to get that off my chest. I really wasn't sure what to expect with 'The Invisible Man'. Horror movies lately have been particularity terrible and so it is hard to get excited about any of them. Leigh Whannell though has proven himself to be a very competent filmmaker, originally just in terms of writing, but lately in the director's chair as well. 'Upgrade' was a terrific film, so that gave me hope. Somehow he has managed to take a very uninspired idea for a story (as we found out with the likes of 'Hollow Man') and make it into something great. This film was a blast.The opening scene sets the tone incredibly for this movie. I've always said your opening scene is the second most important in your film (after the last scene of course) and 'The Invisible Man' nails it. It was immensely intense. The horror side of things later in the film is handled extremely well too. The film never uses false jump-scares. If it's making you jump then something has genuinely happened. And there are some very good scares in this movie. In a world where a lot of people think they can predict exactly what a horror movie is going to do, and when it is going to make you jump, a lot of people will be taken off-guard by this one.I love that Elizabeth Moss was cast as the lead for this movie. They don't even try to doll her up all that much. They are simply happy to rely on her acting skills and have that drive the movie. Too many horror directors would've thrown a supermodel into this role and ruined everything. The only negative I would mention about this movie is that it can be quite tough to watch through the middle. Seeing a woman get unfairly treated and having her treated as crazy when she tells people what is happening to her is not a fun thing to watch. Otherwise though this is a hard film to fault and one I would highly recommend seeing."
1675,"Good movie, good plot, good acting. Glad we used our gift card on this."
1676,"Not only is it a good thriller but it has it's special twist to go along as well. As good as it was, it could have had a bigger audience if the name was changed and the trailer didn't reveal so much. There were so many scenes that would've sold the concept much more suspensefully and professionally if they weren't already spoiled in the trailer.The acting range of Elisabeth Moss is great, my friends and I felt like she sold the idea of that distraught crackhead look as if she had been through hell. Great score as well to go along with the horror and thrill of the invasion of one invisible man."
1677,"Leigh Whannell has come a long way since his debut breakthrough SAW, a movie which I was very hyped for and then very disappointed upon viewing. A year or two ago, when MoviePass was a thing, I took the opportunity to go see movies that I wouldn't typically hit the theaters to see, and out of all those I saw, the one that stood out the most was UPGRADE. Though Upgrade had its share of flaws, the movie was very ambitious and quite refreshing in contrast to the rest of what was being produced in cinema at the time - many things about it were very accomplished and thus impressive. This brought me from viewing Leigh Whannell as someone to avoid to a filmmaker to be excited about. When I saw that he was back with Elisabeth Moss fronting a classic feeling psychological thriller, I got even more hyped, and it delivered as hard as the trailer made me believe it would!This is the best movie I have seen in 2020 so far. In my opinion, it is nearly flawless. If you're the type of person who can't do suspension of disbelief, you might not be able to get into it. But, as someone enjoys art that stretches things a step or two or 500 beyond contemporary belief, I fully enjoyed where this movie went. The tension never eases and only builds and builds and twists tastefully and effectively throughout the entire film. At just over 2 hours, it does not feel long in any sense - in fact I had no idea it was any longer than an hour and forty minutes until i came on here and read so.Elisabeth Moss is one of our current queens of chaos. Not many can pull off crazed quite as well as her. You put her on the forefront of any film right now and you've likely got yourself something gold. This role was perfect for her, I've got to say. The whole cast was rather brilliant though in my opinion. Effective sound design and noisy scoring for tension as well.This reminds me of the type of dark psych-thrillers that were mostly only being made in the 90's. Heavy themes & brutal twists. This is ideal popcorn entertainment for adults. Thoroughly thrilling. This movie has brought Leigh Whannell to a higher level as a filmmaker. I'm excited to see where things go from here for him."
1678,"Believe it or not, I was in an abusive/toxic relationship, no not with a girl and it was actually a friendship. It's quite embarrassing to admit that you've been abused, and I must say that I'm still reluctant to call it abuse, but it was a very toxic and destructive friendship and I'm glad that I got out when I did. But years of shame, self-hatred, and eventually acceptance fell upon me as I had to deal with a multitude of emotions that were difficult, but I came out of it a stronger man. So I definitely could relate to how this woman felt, the fear and the paranoia that can eat you from the inside out.Hearing that Leigh Whannell was taking on a new version of The Invisible Man, I was excited to hear about it. His last film Upgrade, was an excellent, if not under-appreciated science fiction grindhouse thriller and I had a feeling that he could bring a new flare into the concept of an invisible man, and to that, he certainly does. Whannell once more proves that he is a filmmaker to be experienced and he once more creates a chilling and eerily fascinating film.To get some of the more obvious praises out of the way, the acting of this film are excellent. While in previous Invisible Man films, the actual Invisible Man is more of a tragic character. He's not very nice, sure, but he was simply trying to find a way to reverse his condition, going mad once he realizes that there is no way. The Invisible Man in this film is simply a monster, and we don't even really get to see him all that much but his presence looms over the entirety of the film, to good effect. Elizabeth Moss is also fantastic in this film, I felt bad for her character and I genuinely wanted her to get out of this safely and get back at the monster whose made her life a living hell. The way that Moss also conveys her character's fear and paranoia is also seamless, I never felt for a second that she was acting fearful and paranoid, she simply conveyed that she was fearful and paranoid. I also appreciated the genuine chemistry that Moss' character had with her friends and sister also felt real and you truly began to root for these characters and hope that they all get out ok.As films like The Shining, Alien, and No Country For Old Men have demonstrated, silence can sometimes be much more effective in conveying suspense and tension, and Whannell understands this to a tee. I thought that the quiet moments were far more effective in building suspense rather than the loud, bombastic moments, though Whannell also takes a note from John Carpenter in how to combine loud and quiet moments without losing the viewer's attention. Though also, the music and score of this film also conveys the looming tension and suspense that adds to this film's diabolical atmosphere.This is how you remake a classic everyone. Give something new to say rather than rehashing the old, tired tropes that have been done to death, and Whannell proves that he make mostly anything into something interesting, even if it is a story that we've heard our fair share of times."
1679,"The invisible man takes a story done a million times and finally does something new. Elizabeth Moss bring a performance worth of an Oscar nomination, and you feel for her character all the way though. The direction is spot on filming a simple scene where no one is in the shot, but you fully believe an invisible person is there. The movie hits on all parts. Must watch!"
1680,"I'm a fan of Elisabeth for her role in The handsmail tales, so when I saw that she was staring as the lead in a movie I had to see it. It was interesting to see her at the theater because she's more a tv celebrity for me and she is what I thought she would be : Perfect. She is in almost every scenes and for a good reason. But I good actress alone cannot make a good movie. The story and the camera plans kept me wanting more. I suggest it to everybody who like a good thriller."
1681,"A little slow
Good music helps to make the movie
Many illogical plot devices"
1682,"It's a good concept of invisible man and it's amazing to watch so you can watch it
I give 9 because I want to see more bit it's end so fast in last moment"
1683,"The movie ""Invisible Man"" is the exact definition of ""i'm going to wake up in the middle of the night and think, am I being watched?"". An almost perfect thriller what could really rattle your bones. The reason as to why it got a 7 is due to the amount of twists it has, even to the point where it gets slightly repulsive. In conclusion if you're waiting for the perfect thriller movie what you can get startled by (not scared) then this is a movie for you!."
1684,"So the better half and I went to the movies to see this movie, which sounded promising.
Elisabeth Moss portrays a woman who escapes her abusive partner who later commits suicide and just when she thinks she can start all over again incidents start happening.
The tension build up certainly gave my better half a couple of frights but I would not call this a horror. Yes there is blood being spilled but the build up of suspense I found more akin to a decent thriller. One of the plot twist I could see coming from a mile away but there were other twists that did catch me unaware.
I found the acting of everyone to be good and it was a surprise to find out the cost of this movie was only $8 million with the CGI being well done considering that budget.
Well done to everyone involved and I didn't regret seeing it."
1685,"A thriller for sure, but followed up with some lazy writing and extreme plot holes. I wont write this review with a bunch of spoilers but I will say if you're not watching this movie and saying ""COMMMON"" during certain scenes you're not much for looking at things objectively. Overall it was a cool syfi thriller but they could have focused a little more on the syfi rather than focusing on Elizabeth Mosses overacting damsel in distress faces. Oh and please directors, filming something in the pitch black is STUUUUUUUUUUPID. If I can't see a damn thing that's happening it's not that scary, more annoying than anything."
1686,"I liked about 85% of this movie. It does a really good job setting up the story, the tension and the character of Cecilia. I liked that this was a different version of The Invisible Man and that it's focus was more on the victim and how he manipulates and terrorizes her and makes her question her own sanity. And Elizabeth Moss does a fantastic job. The movie is simple, yet effective with the scares and one legitimately surprised me. However, there is also some inconsistencies. For instance there is one scene, where she dumps paint on him (as shown in the trailers)...yet seemingly she reaches a point where she doesnt see paint on the floor anymore as though he stopped dripping paint, then she hears a faucet turn on and when she walks towards it, she sees paint in the basin. As though he washed it off. Well, why didnt she then see the paint being washed off? She tells a couple of people that she has proof, well if he's clearly overhearing this...why doesnt he then search his home to find out whats missing? He does catch her at his house the scene before...so wouldnt he put 2 and 2 together? Theres another thing as well in the 3rd act, but I dont want to give away the mechanics of how the invisibility works.Overall though, I thought it was very good. Not overly scary imo but effectively thrilling."
1687,A nail bitting thriller movie to watch for especially the great and thriller scenes of all a must watch movie for everyone with a horror mix.
1688,"You know the drill. invisible man terrorizes woman. bad things happen. all in all, not bad. the thing is in a very packed house, not one person checked their phone. not even once. and one more thing. elisabeth moss is now a movie star."
1689,"The film masterfully brings the story up-to-date with the original story. The acting's great; the sounds are eerie to go with that feel of paranoia that he could be anywhere.Elisabeth Moss in particular does a fantastic job as Cecilia, a survivor of domestic abuse who escapes her abusive boyfriend Adrian Griffin, but she still feels trapped by him. You feel increasingly bad for her plight when everything starts to collapse around her.The actions' also great. You get the sense that Elisabeth is genuinely punching at someone with brunt force rather than taking jabs at thin air.Overall, greatly loved this take of the source material and actually I can say I want to see more from it."
1690,"This movie has so many engaging twists and turns! The storyline is exactly what I expect from scary movies I grew up on and doesn't disappoint on any level. This movie is captivating from start to finish trust me you'll love it. Direction, as well as actors, did an amazing job, to say the least."
1691,"The Invisible ManI loved it.A very different twist on the usual story, a tense gripping drama, not really a horror, that delivered in spades with twists and turns.Elizabeth Moss threw herself into the role of the hunted victim who fights back. The acting by Elizabeth Moss was first rate, we were up close and it really was an emotional journey with frustration, anger and resilience expressed at the same instant.I must mention Aldis Hodge who played the best friend, he really does a great job and this is yet another fine performance in movie after movie. If it's possible I think we may have found the new younger Denziel Washington here and I would like to see him in a gritty lead role.Overall this movie is a must see"
1692,"The Invisible Man has no business being good. Yet, it is. At times, it's even great. At its best, it's a showcase of the continuing wonders of practical effects. Any scene where he strikes, it's effective in just how much is done without computer graphics. Elizabeth Moss is fantastic here. This film shines the most when it's just her vs. The Invisible Man. Everything else around that sort of falls short. It's far from perfect. Nonetheless, A slasher/stalker movie was an ingenious twist on and old, classic horror movie monster. The hits keep on coming from Blumhouse."
1693,I give 9/10. Its the movie was so scary yet logical plot of the story. This movie made me think thats The Invinsible Man is the sample for the best horror movie.
1694,"Moss plays the abused partner of an multi millionaire optics expert. When she escapes at the beginning of this story, her violent, vindictive partner apparently commits suicide. Still in hiding, troubling things start happening to Moss.Hard to overstate how tight and tense from frame first to last this is. Littered with eerie and a few genuinely shocking moments, this is a pretty masterful classic horror story, hitched neatly on the back of a real story of appalling abuse. Moss is good in the lead, with a strong supporting cast, particularly Aldis Hodge who does well as the single level headed persona. It could perhaps have been a little shorter and the ending is not entirely unpredictable, but overall a great piece of entertainment."
1695,"Ignore the pathetic reviews, from men who hate it when anyone acknowledges a man hurting a woman. We get it.The movie was gripping and intense. The acting was excellent (Moss is reliably fantastic). The directing was good and the score was great. I believe this will be one of the best movies of 2020."
1696,A movie that is really good with good plot twists.
1697,"I like how this movie plays in the psychological field and how it has a supernatural feel. The first part of the movie was very interesting and gave a sense of hopelessness. The movie slightly started to get out of the horror zone and here where started to get less interesting.
Good points:-
1- it felt original although concept of invisible psycho is not new
2- unpredictable
3- it is emotionalBad points:-
The twist was good but it just didn't make sense
The protagonist is shown many times smart but with a weak personality because of an abusive relationship, so the change of her character at the end was indeed unrealistic.Good movie overall, finally a movie that felt unique since US and Get Out"
1698,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Universal Studios is attempting to reboot their Monster Universe with this movie. Based on positive audience and critic reviews, this nail-biting thriller must might do the job. Based on the popular H. G. Wells science fiction novel The Invisible Man, Director Leigh Wahnnell has proven himself quite talented in the horror genre. He wrote the screenplay and directed the film. Don't let the Blumhouse name on the film scare you away. This ain't no Blumhouse's Fantasy Island disappointment.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Extreme domestic violence, abuse
Some profanity, including 1 F-bomb. A man starts to swear but then stops because a child is in the room.
A teenage girl gets slapped really hard.
Several deaths with blood, gore, and splattersTHINGS I LIKED:
Elisabeth Moss consistently offers a strong performance in everything she does. I first noticed her in Mad Men and was impressed. She IS the film and does an excellent job carrying it. Every time she tip-toes around a room and breathes heavily, it made me want to be extra quiet for her while sitting in my theater chair.
I've always preferred subtly to in-your-face action in movies. This movie has it in spades because what you CAN'T see is so much scarier.
While I never saw the Insidious horror serious because I really don't like creepy movies, director Leigh Whannell has a solid reputation behind him and knows how to properly build tension with chilling scenes that start from the very first minute. I hear he's working on a new film: Escape from New York Fingers crossed that he does an equally good job on that reboot.
Cool ocean wave intro.
Suspenseful sound effects The Invisible Man
Each scene takes it time. That might sound slow, but it's perfectly tasty.
The suggested camera angles that peek into a room around the corners and only show you parts of the room are extremely effective and affect you psychologically. You find yourself squinting to be sure if you saw something or to look for something that the camera suggests is there.
Have you ever felt someone looking at you? People have a Spidey sense about things like that.
I loved the scene where you see Elisabeth Moss' cold breath fog when she steps outside and then you see another one behind her. Creepy!
I love twists!
Lesson learned: Keep a fire extinguisher and knives in your kitchen. Oh yeah, learn how to shoot a gun.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Don't watch the trailer before you watch the movie. Too much information about scenes will ruin the fun.
The movie could have been WAY more fun if it had been given a different name! Because of it's current title, you KNOW there is going to be an invisible man. Imagine how much more intense it could be if you didn't know that when the movie starts! What do you think of the movie title ""Breath""? That's the one I thought of. Good, right?
Too bad he couldn't think of a better way to use his cool power of invisibility. I mean...do something for good.
There are several plot points and details that make no logical sense at all. I could point them all out to you, but that would probably ruin the movie for you and I want you to enjoy it. Try not to focus on them and you'll enjoy the ride.
The movie poster is way too dark.
There have been several movies made about the Invisible Man story. Fans of the story might be disappointed that this new addition to the concept doesn't really add anything new, although it's told well.
It always frustrates me when characters on the screen don't do what I think they should. For example, if there's a bad guy trying to kill you and he knocks someone else's gun onto the floor near you, pick up that gun! Quickly!
You can watch the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom channel on YouTube!"
1699,"A thriller with amzing jump scares all in the right place and all scene are relanvent to the story line. And the CGI of the invisible man in all scene including in one pertictular scene not saying what one have to see it in cinema to find out. The CGI of un reveling the invisible man with object and how they did it was amzing. Elizabeth play her role tremendously well.
It definitely a must see."
1700,Absolutely loved it. Very creepy and suspenseful. Nice plot twists and great performances. Never a dull moment!
1701,"Moss is excellent, very good thriller, despite grabbing my coach I really enjoyed this movie.
I also enjoyed the very little music background that can be so annoying covering the dialogues and the killing the vibes of the movie.
Great movie, watch it..."
1702,"Better than the original. Would recommend to see
Interesting plot and thrilling"
1703,"You can't call it thriller or horror movie with the old standards...
There are lots of turn of events in this movie,dark scenes and a dangerous man, no-one is able to see"
1704,"I had huge expectations going into this film for two reasons. One, the trailer for this film was brilliant it sucked me in, immersed me in the world and the basis of the story, I was intrigued to say the least. The second reason being the director and writer of the film Leigh Whannell, who had astounded me a few years ago with the great Sci-Fi thriller ""Upgrade"". This film quickly shot up my most anticipated list of 2020.........so in some ways I was setting myself up for disappointment, however I am very glad to say that no I was not disappointment at all...........""The Invisible Man"" is a great film!!Lets start with the man in question Leigh Whannell, he has not only directed but written a truly gorgeously horrifying film........if that makes any sense. The directing in this film builds upon what he had shown in ""Upgrade"" only this time you can see this is with a little more budget. Flawless from start to finish , along with some great cinematography, production design and CGI this film is gorgeous to look at even in the most disgustingly uncomfortable brutal scenes.
The heart of this film tackles something extremely sensitive and very current in the world today and that is domestic abuse. Right as the film starts it drops you in at the deep end, with the main characters struggle of being in a abusive relationship she is trying to runaway from mental and physically. However her freedom doesn't last very long........ the idea of your abuser being invisible and stalking you is a truly horrifying idea. Even the thought of it gives me chills. Then to only go and start controlling her life again whilst invisible to everyone else, sending emails and hurting people she loves, this film is psychologically haunting. There are so many twists and turns throughout that left me gasping..............that doesn't happen very often!Fortunately this film doesn't have to rely on great CGI to keep you interested, the story and characters themselves are so intoxicating that you can't help but be absorbed by what is going on..........however the limited action and CGI used in this film is fantastic !! Couple all that with the films fantastic score and we really do have something that is elevated to another level!Another big big shoutout must be given to Elizabeth Moss who is simply incredibly in the lead role as Cecilia Kass. You can see the torment of the character just shown through her facial expressions , this is a really really honest look at what it is like to go through something like this. The film and Moss's performance do in no way either dramatise or over play the domestic abuse angle...........they show the destruction it can cause in someones life and the horrifying consequences you have to live through. I have personally never really like Elizabeth Moss as an actress but now I think I'll give her another chance because she was amazing to say the least.All in all I wasn't disappointed one bit and thought the film was really really good 85% out of 100 or 8.5 out of 10 , this is another home run for Leigh Whannell. I do truly think that this man could be the next Denis Villeneuve...........just let the man do whatever he wants to do because he obviously has talent !! ""Upgrade"" and now ""The Invisible Man""............I can't wait to see what he does next !!! This is a must see for fans of Horror, Thriller and Sc-Fi..............this film has a little bit of everything in it !!!!!!"
1705,"The first 15 minutes of this movie is more gripping than the entire length of many movies that came last year. A woman escapes from her abusive husband but soon experiences events that make her doubt his death.
There are numerous scenes in this movie that are shot excellently and they really give you the chills. The emphasis is not on jump scares; the atmosphere itself causes goosebumps. A big house occupied only by two people; an abusive husband who wants to control even his wife's thoughts; the premise is great. It is very easy to scare your audience using jump scares. But it is very difficult to make them shiver at the thought that even a small holding facility can have an invisible person. The director excels at that.
In some scenes, you expect a jump scare but it ends on a plain note. That is good directing. Don't give us what we have in our mind. Make us crave for more. Surprise us.
Towards the end, the screenplay goes downhill. Yes, the husband wants to stalk her and torture her. But, why does his brother promise the protagonist that he would help her get out of prison, if she agreed to raise her child with her husband who is indeed alive? It does not make sense. If her husband really wants to be with her again, why send her to prison in the first place? The director does not give enough answers to satisfy us and that did let me down.
But, this movie is a really good thriller with a lot of scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat."
1706,"A breathtaking experience with a great performance from Elizabeth Moss and an awesome creation of action scenes portrayed by a promising director that I personally like so much after watching 'Upgrade'. All these elements made this picture a ones to watch and possibly one of the most underrated movies of the year. However, this didn't mean that it is full of positives and my only problem or negative point in this movie is the drama. If there was a little bit of it during the non-thriller scenes, the picture would be perfectly made. At the end, this the movie that you need to attend to in February. A Well Deserved 8/10 :)"
1707,"If your wanting to see a horror, then maybe stay clear. If your after a sunspensful thriller with a few jumps, then this is the movie for you.The acting was excellent and I fancied the concept and spin of the 'invisible' man (you'll understand what I mean once you see it). Most of the movie is thoroughly enjoyable and will leave you on the edge of your seat. However there were clear plot point issues which can be frustrating. Overall an enjoyable experience."
1708,"Producer Jason Blum And Director Leigh Whannell Who Brought Leigh Whannell's Directional Debut Film ""Upgrade"" Now Have Team Up Again For ""The Invisible Man"". Now i Have To Say i Really Enjoyed This New Take Version Of The Invisible Man But This Version Has Nothing To Do With The Original Invisible Man Film But Going Back Of Watching The Original One it Was Scary Back When it Came Out in The 1930s Nowdays The Original it's Not Really That Scary it's More Now a Dark Humor Monster Film But in This Newest Version Of ""The Invisible Man"" The Story is About a Woman Name Cecilia Who For a Long Time Her Boyfriend Adrian Griffin Have Controlled Her By Telling Her Of What To Wear, What To Eat And Where To Go Places So One Night While Her Boyfriend Adrian Griffin is Dead On Sleeping Cecilia Quietly Sneaks Out Of The House To Get Away From Her Abuseive Boyfriend And Run Away With Her Sister Now Three Months Later After The News About Adrian Griffin's Suicide Death Abd Leaves His Entire Esate And Money To Cecilia But After a While Cecilia Notice Something Strange She's Convice That Adrian Who is a Brilliant Scientist is Not Really Dead That He Somehow Found a Way To Make Himself in Invisible So He Can Stalk And Tormenting Cecilia By Taking Pictures Of Cecilia By a Cell Phone Camera, Moving Kitchen Knifes, Hurting People That She Cares About And By Making Her Go insanely Crazy As Cecilia Keeps Trying Everyone That Adrian Has Come Back invisible But is She Really Making This Crazy Story Up Or if it's Someone Who Trying To Get in Her Head i Guess You Have See The Movie For Yourself And Believe if it's True Or Not.
