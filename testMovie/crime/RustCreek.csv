0,"I started this movie with little expectation, and found a hidden acorn. I really liked it, it was not just ""wrong turn"" movie the story had some substance. Acting was good and the story moved along with some twists and turns. Worth watching."
1,"I stumbled upon this movie but was worried about any graphic rape scenes that are included in so many of these type. I think it was very well done. There was action, drama, lots of twists and the acting was good. I really enjoyed just a great drama and thriller without the extra gore many other titles bring. It is definitely worth renting."
2,"I'm glad I gave this a try. After the first few minutes of yelling at the screen for her to do this not that (!) the story settled in and held my attention. All the actors were believable and I was hoping the formula was going where I thought it was because, you know, revenge is sweet! I recommend this one as a good Saturday afternoon kick back and watch an entertaining tale."
3,"Read the mixed reviews on this but decided to give it a go, yes it's been done a million times over but have to admit, quite liked this one.I never give too much away, if i review anything but please give this one a go, i think you may be pleasantly surprised."
4,"Once again,the whole premise of the movie is based on the fact that the main character has to be a complete idiot.Maybe that's the theme with today's lack of common sense in people?1) gets off highway to get past traffic. Fine, but follows ""google maps"" to a dead end. Instead of turning around and retracing her route, she continues until the road becomes nothing more than a path.
2) Stops,gets out of the car to read the map. Who the hell does that when it's cold outside? You sit in the seat, spread the map out in front of you and figure out where you are. DUH
3) Gets stabbed, runs away. Fine, Removes sweatshirt to patch stab, then leaves it behind. DUH
4) runs around for hours without tending the wound. Removes socks to treat wound the next day, removes socks to check, runs away yet again leaving ""bandage"" behind.
5) sees car wrecked by pursuers. Doesn't bother getting warm clothes, more items to bandage wound, immediately grabs phone and wanders around like a moron with her arm in the air looking for a signal once again, ignoring the wound in her leg.I'm only 30 minutes in, I'll keep watching to see what other idiotic things she does."
5,"Rust Creek is a good little drama/thriller. The story is pretty good. The directing, cinematography and acting are good. I don't remember any cringe-inducing moments where supposedly smart people do dumb things to move the plot along. And if there's an intended female empowerment message it's not obtrusive.I know that in our current overly PC culture we have a few movies that are thinly-disguised excuses for male bashing (I'm looking at you ""Bad Moms""), but this isn't one of them. The main (and only) female character is smart and brave but not unrealistically so. She worsens her situation by making some understandable mistakes. The three bad characters are made up of two men who are truly vile and one guy who, if left on his own, would probably make kinder choices but he's too stupid and weak to not go along with the other two. That's it for the bad men. All the other men have admirable character traits with one whose desire to fight injustice and protect the main character rises to the level of heroic.This is a good movie made by competent people and I would recommend it."
6,"Rust Creek was a thriller that managed to transcend the genre. The plot had sufficient intriguing twists and turns. More importantly, the main characters were well-acted, and they quietly engendered a strong sympathy. The screenplay was intelligent and well-crafted. The ending was unusually well-done, particularly for this kind of movie.."
7,"Having said that this isnt really that bad but its not really that good either.I was hoping for a gruesome Wrong Turn clone but sadly not!Some good acting, I have always liked John Marshall Jones and he puts in the best performance as always but the story has been done to death a hundred times before and there is no suspense or real drama.Its pretty standard TV movie fair you would find on a wet Sunday afternoon on Paramount channel."
8,"This one's definitely edge-of-your-seat, but there are several truly touching moments between the two main characters. Certainly worth a watch."
9,"I was able to see Rust Creek at SDFF, and I thoroughly enjoyed it! It wasn't too scary and had plenty of quiet, thoughtful moments. So it struck a nice balance between drama and action/thriller. I also love how much the environment played a part in the film, and how the Kentucky landscape is really featured. As much as I enjoyed the look and feel though, I have to say, the score is probably the highlight of the film for me."
10,"Beautifully shot, very well-written, and wonderfully acted. Hermione Corfield is a new name for me but I suspect this film could do for her what Winter's Bone did for Jennifer Lawrence. Very strong performance and a very clever story. I stumbled onto this little gem while searching with my daughter for strong female leads and we loved it."
11,Rust Creek had some clever twists that caught me by surprise. The scenery highlights the beauty in Kentucky's forests and it is great to hear that there is both a female director and writer.
12,"Well worth a watch, never dull and entertaining. Pretty much what you look for in a film."
13,"Full disclosure, I couldn't actually finish this. Too many preposterous scenarios and completely unrealistic story that a tries to reinvent the outdated ""traveler lost in the woods and threatened by hillbillies"" story. Way beyond the outer boundaries of imagination. There are better ways to portray strong women."
14,"Aside from the female lead it's a story that's been told before only this time with a weird relationship between the female lead and her would be criminal captor/rescuer
It's TV drama level acting and direction with a dull story not helping it out.
Pretty sure this would only appeal to those who have a great fear of being lost in hill billy land otherwise avoid watching"
15,"Just so hard to suspend my disbelief. A young girl beats up 2 grown men, and kills a third. Really forcing the girl power angle, and with a female director. Overrated."
16,"Too many plot holes in this film. A seemingly intelligent girl, relying on GPS and ends up on the beaten track. First of all, why not just turn around (like normal people would?). Secondly, when the Pritchet Brothers push Sawyer's car off the cliff (at the request of the Sheriff we find out), when the coast is clear, she doesn't grab her back and food/drink which considering she's injured and cold and needing sustinence would make sense, instead she just grabs her damaged mobile phone. At the point Deputy Nick gets shot by the Chief, I AM DONE. At a minimum, knowing the Sheriff is bent and must have some comprehension his (Nick) life is at risk - he'd have at least shot him in the leg or something to immobilize - no, he bends down for his dropped keys and winds up dead. Even the State Police are dumbasses and accept the evidence planted in Nick's locker after the Sheriff confirms he has ""disappeared"". Now, I have just lost interest. Not worth the $8 rental. Too many stereotypes with the rednecks in the woods - been done so many times before and so much better."
17,"Bad acting, bad script. So many illogical decisions made. The cinematography is laughable, going for stylized shots that just don't work. If the movie cut out all the extended scenes of people standing while looking at a thing or staring at a person while moody music played this movie would be about 40 minutes long. I like the idea of having a female heavy crew, but there are females out there with real talent. Maybe find them?"
18,"Ok, let's forget about the cliché opening of the lost traveller and the gruesome hillbillies. Now I only had to wait and see why Rotten Tomatoes gave this movie an 8.3. The folowing fifteen minutes were certainly original - and I'm not talking about the odd duration of certain scenes (sometimes limping and sometimes running), no, I'm talking about the completely unbelievable holes in the scenario.Why didn't the goons search the abandoned car of the girl after they left her stranded in the woods. No need for money or valuables? Ok, let's forget this as well. Next item: why didn't the police man search the car immediately (anybody interested in the drivers identity? Hey, what about a drivers license? Ever heard of a dashboard?) - Oh, and of course the police man didn't take a look in the car at all otherwise he could have picked up the girl's cell phone.
This last absurdity was right in my face when the goons drove the girl's car to a cliff and tipped it over. Conveniently the girl was hiding under the cliff and the first thing she rescued from the car wreck was... her (damaged) cell phone.
Not hair raising stupid enough? How about the car keys? They were still in the ignition when the police found the abandoned car. Why didn't the police drove the car to the police station but just left it there on the road?Ok, let's forget about all this. Could I? No, I couldn't really... because after watching countless close ups of the grimacing face of the girl - was she wounded? OMG, she was WOUNDED, go tell it on the mountain! - close ups of colorful leaves, menacing clouds and spits and spats of the rustic river I decided I had seen enough of this camouflaged C-movie with its 'scenic cinematography and its layered story that touches upon the inherent horror in being a woman.' (Rotten Tomatoes)."
19,"""Rust Creek"" 5/10 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
This film has ""I spit on your Grave"" written all over it. Is it because of the outta town woman who becomes terrorized by the local hillbilly boys. Or maybe because the way she's injured and stuck in their neck of the woods clinging for dear life. It also could be the shaky unapologetic sheriff or other locals who seem to not have her best interests in mind not knowing what side of the fence they're on good or evil. Whatever the case may be this movie doesn't provide enough mystery it's very rushed and the predictability meter is off the charts. Even the way it ends just isn't plausible and seems very cheesy for the film to not put more effort into the final sequence. The acting wasn't too bad but nothing marvelous to hold your breath for. I thought the storyline was interesting enough to watch it all the way through but it wasn't worth the wait. I give this a 5 The film was Ok but I would say pass if it's a take it or leave it scenario."
20,"The movie is so predictable its boring. The only good performance is the cousin who helps her. The main character makes multiple illogical and stupid mistakes I could see her making from miles away. I knew the sheriff was dirty from the start. The story itself has been done many times. Nothing is unexpected or exciting. There is even glare on the camera in multiple outside scenes. Not well made, well performed or well written. Basic as basic can be and so predictable"
21,"I came in expecting the stereotypical ""damsel in distress"" horror movie, but it turns out Rust Creek is not that. At all.
Anchored by the impressive performances of Hermione Corfield and Jay Paulson, Rust Creek is a unique little tale that offers both entertainment and food for thought. All the supporting performances were excellent and I liked the fact that it was filmed in the Kentucky woods, something rarely seen in cinema.
Always great to find an indie gem & this one checks all the boxes!"
22,"Fine acting directed to perfection as an unlikely friendship evolves beautifully, to the final scene, to one of loyalty and possibly even love. Expect to be touched as chemistry sets the scene; not only in the talk when they cook, but the male-female kind too."
23,"I gave this movie an 8 because it's realistic. If you've ever spent time living anywhere rural, especially in the southern states but not limited to, you've encountered the characters at some point. Maybe not directly, but exposure and they're pretty creepy. And the situation the main character is in is a fear people can relate to. It's got some twists, and it held my attention with a few on edge moments. If you remember the feeling Deliverance gave you, it'll entertain you. I liked it. A pretty good thriller."
24,I wouldn't label this horror. It's a thriller. I loved the actors. Some say it's been done before. I think the relationship between the young woman and the meth cook was an added bonus to making this a good film and prevented it from being a typical plot that hasn't been done before. Some say it's slow. Not at all - there's a certain crowd that wants constant explosions and gunfights. I myself love suspense in between action scenes. That's what makes a good thriller. I also didn't think the girl was stupid. I thought she was pretty smart and a good heroine.
25,"Beautifully shot, delicately directed and acted. Production design was also really detail-oriented. And a lot of scores for films like this are somewhat cookie-cutter, but not Rust Creek! The composer did a standout job. I actually noticed how much I liked the music right away. Not to mention a handful of women behind the camera in key roles! Something I love to see.
The acting really is phenomenal in this film. Hermione Corfield does such a great job, I almost forgot I was watching a movie. The relationships between the characters are believable and the pacing really kept me on my toes. I want to watch this one again because I feel like there are some details and things that I missed. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made me really take a hard look at how I would be able to survive in this kind of situation (not sure that I could, to be honest...). It was great!!"
26,Sometimes I rate a movie based on if I would watch it again because I am the kind of person who can watch a good movie many times over a period of time. This movie I will not watch again but it wasn't awful. I think the current rating of 5.8 is pretty spot on. I do think the actors did a good job though
27,"This wasn't too bad a movie as a female student is headed for a job interview, takes a wrong turn in the Kentucky wilderness, encounters some Deliverance type rednecks, snd winds up in a fight for her life and embroiled in a conspiracy with s little help from s local. I liked all the characters and the scenery and the story. Everything was a nice surprise.** 1/2 out of ****"
28,The stupidity of the heroine is really limitless. Don't waste time.
29,"It's predictable, it's unoriginal, but damn if it didn't hook me in. Actually one of the better movies I've watched where you don't have to invest or care too much.
The main actress and the guy playing Lowell just blew me away - great acting can save a mediocre plot.
Worth a watch for sure!"
30,"12/03/2020 OK, let's see???... I'm a young girl traveling alone and due to me foolishly relying on some electronic gizmo to find my way to my destination, I stop along some desolate backwoods road, get out of the safety of my hupmobile just to read my Chinese directional goo-goo map. Thankfully, I don't have to drop my dirty bloomers to go wee wee because here comes two overly friendly Hillbilly Bobs, one looks kinda normal, the other one big and fat and looks like he eats little girls like myself everyday, just for funzees. I ask you? What's wrong with this pixture Ms.Ethel? As expected the movie plays out from there like you think it would. Not necessarily a bad movie, just not really a great or scary movie but worth watching at least once. Watch for yourself and decide. Bon Appetit'"
31,"This movie wasn't bad but the beginning was its undoing. I once got off the highway in the middle of nowhere to avoid a standstill of traffic. But I'm not dumb enough to follow a GPS into a dead end. Ok, so let's get past that part. The girl encounters two guys who make her feel uncomfortable and fists fly and she runs into the woods. After she successfully hides from them, how she doesn't know her way back to her car is beyond me. I know the woods can turn you around but personally this would never happen to me. All you need is a little sense of direction to retrace your steps. The movie could've been so much better without how stupidly it started."
32,"It's well done. For a movie with suspense, it did a fairly good job. There are some parts that are a little like, 'why did she not know, it's obvious'. But overall it's worth watching."
33,Only a Woman with GPS and a Map could get lost... Haven't we seen this movie a million times before??
34,"This was a surprisingly good film that my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed. A nice original plot with a couple of twists and an excellent performance by Hermione Corfield, who's Kentucky accent happened to be extremely convincing by the English actress. Well worth a watch."
35,So naive movie or perhaps people are so stupid in real life. For real movie fans this is horrible..
36,"This had the potential to be a decent thriller, but the pacing is frustatingly slow. The heroine also makes a lot of dumb decisions which made it hard to sympathise with her predicament."
37,"My friend and I caught an early screening of Rust Creek at Soho House in Chicago. We may have screamed through the whole thing - but this is truly an outstanding indie film. Hermione Corfield is outstanding in this - she has a big career ahead of her. Jay Paulson's performance is also very, very good. The movie is a thriller- but it is also incredibly inspiring, and it's wonderful testament to the strength of a woman. My friend and I left deciding to get self defense classes. A great movie for young women to see!"
38,"8 stars here, this movie was well made. Not your run of the mill girl takes wrong turn and everything goes bad from there.
P.C. yes and no, a young girl lost and so afraid she cannot do anything right, nope.
I went into this movie thinking it will not last 15 min. This kept me entertained throughout. Give this movie a try you should not be disappointed."
39,"Minor spoilers.
I stopped watching this very average ""thriller"" after an hour..couldn't be bothered to watch it to the end. there is nothing, really nothing that kept my attention. in the beginning, there is too many unlikely coincidences, the main character behaves strange, like puts on a bandage but removes it in the next scene. and the other characters are so predictable, as is the story. save your time, skip this one!"
40,"My husband and I just streamed ""Rust Creek"". What a thrilling gut punch. Stacks of tension that never lets up. Great actors. Beautifully shot. Directed perfectly!! It is a MUST SEE!!!"
41,"One girl tries to come back home for a break but because of the jammed motorway she needs to take alternate route. That is how her story starts. Story filled with dread and horror. Nobody is prepared for what is going to unfold here. When you travel deep into the redneck's territory you are asking for trouble. Movie takes you on the trip deep into human's nature. You will see fight for survival for at least ..... 35 minutes, than the movie completely changes dynamic and the constant initial feeling of danger, dread and uncertainty evaporates and is replaced by catalougue of ""Ohhh I DID SEE THAT COMING"" and than ends with ""OHHHH I KNEW IT IS GONNA END LIKE THIS, WHAT A WASTED OPPORTUNITY"". I watched the whole movie, my wi-fe fell asleep midway through. There are far better movies of this type. I would position this somewhere between: ""Lack of substance and style"" and ""only watch if you are waiting for next episode of your favorite TV show or computer/console broke down"". Alternatively if you like this sort of movies watch first 35 minutes and than fast forward to the last 20."
42,This movie was absolutely thrilling. I was completely engaged the entire film and thought the storyline was both unique and suspenseful. 10/10 recommend for anyone looking for an intriguing plot that will certainly keep you guessing.
43,"This is an exciting thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat. While slow in some parts, this film kept me engaged and really invested in the main character's struggle to survive. Loved the twists and turns throughout the film too! Definitely check this out if you're looking for an intense thriller with vibes of Winter's Bone and Breaking Bad."
44,"RUST CREEK is a typical small scale thriller in which a young girl finds herself lost in the wooded wilderness and at the mercy of a couple of dodgy redneck characters who want her for their own nefarious purposes. She stumbles across the home of another redneck and ends up joining forces with him, although his motivations remain a mystery. It's simplistic stuff that we've seen play out time and time again, with certain character twists being entirely routine and predictable, but the cinematography's quite pretty and the performances naturalistic. It could have done with a little more suspense, though."
45,"Saw this indie gem at the San Diego Film Festival and was pleasantly surprised. Set to the backdrop of the stunning Kentucky landscape, the story of Sawyer's literal quest to survive meshes well with her more philosophical journey to discover what truly matters. Rust Creek offers a good combination of drama and thrills, as well as some unexpected twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Would recommend to drama/thriller lovers, indie or not!"
46,"Some of my favorite movies are tightly-wrought dramas and thrillers and this movie fits in the wheelhouse. The bells and whistles of Hollywood money always distract me, and this felt all the more gritty, real, and dangerous for its lower budget and its on-location shooting. Glad to see a tough woman in front of the camera and behind!"
47,"I gave this a 7 because of the way some bits in it were a bit silly.People would not just believe the first thing they see and you can't just bump off a police officer if you are a police officer yourself and within 2 minutes they are off the hook.Other than that the trio of main leads were Strong, relatable and they kept me interested. The relationship between them is interesting and believable.I enjoyed it, was worth a watch, different although it's not going to smash any records."
48,I cAn not Write anything here ... i would be wasting more time !
49,Average yarn with minimal tension. Young woman gets lost. Meets bad guy hillbillies. Gets injured. Runs around woods grunting (think gollum). Corrupt cop enters story. Artistic shots abound with no story value. Story drags on with more odd occurrences. Lots of goofs but what the heck. It's a time waster movie. Nothing deep here.
50,Obviously a lot of plot holes but if you can ignore them and enjoy the suspense it is pretty well acted and well shot5.8
51,"Deliciously enjoyable thriller with taught acting, strong production, engaging characters and captivating story. Well worth time and money."
52,This is the type of film that grips you and won't let go until well after the credits have rolled. This is indie film making at its best!!
53,"Sawyer (Hermione Corfield) is going for a job interview and her GPS steers her wrong. She ends up in the middle of meth country where two yokels think she saw something and want her dead. Their cousin, who does the cooking in a remote trailer, hides her in plain sight.This is another girl hunted in the woods film without the thrills of a decent chase and hunt. Sawyer is a long distance runner, which played slightly into the film but was not a major plot point without a flashback. I thought the acting was decent, but it was apparent they were struggling with a bad script. Hermione Corfield had a decent soft Southern accent for a Brit.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
54,"What an amazing movie, the soundtrack, cinematography and
acting surperb throughout! Never a dull moment, in fact
I was enjoying it so much I didn't want it to end! I'm
giving this gem of a movie 8, fantastic job to everyone involved."
55,"Really well shot, beautiful scenery. I went into thinking it was a horror type film but was a solid suspense type thriller. The actors/actress are all unknown to me, they were all great performances particularly the main lead actress really did a good job throughout and her relationship/interaction with Lol was quite touching in parts and the best section of film imho. I well suggest this movie as a good watch."
56,"This movie is interesting, but in real life if you want to do a road trip across states by yourself as a woman, you need a gun to protect yourself. Guns don't kill people, people kill people, and that will be the end of the story.😁😁😁😁"
57,"Girl is lost, some guys tries to get her, she beats two guys twice her size and escapes. WTF... then boring implausible nonsense... she faint and is rescued by a a meth cooker WTF... more boring totally implausible crap... the meth cook gives his life for the girl WTF! She escapes beating an armed cop twice her size too WTF!!! It seems written by a 12 yo kid. Waste of life. AVOID!"
58,"Rust Creek's moody and evocative cinematography creates a visceral sense of the environment, bringing us closer to the protagonist's experience. Propelled by a stellar, subtle performance by Hermione Cornfield, this film is a valuable, thoughtful addition to the ""Me Too"" cannon that leaves its audience inspired and motivated to take control of their own self-defense."
59,Was not sure what to expect but this film is actually very solid & entertaining.I hope it does very well financially as it covers a lot of crime based drama with a small budget.Minimal setup easy to follow story & character motivations. Well worth your time & money as its such a well crafted movie.Barren bleak Kentucky wilderness also adds a lot of extra atmosphere to the story.
60,"Sawyer (Hermione) delivers a stunningly underplayed and authentic performance, as do most of the cast. This movie draws you in slowly and grips you till the end with well-paced and well-placed twists and turns."
61,A lower budget movie with unknowns but actually good. The Sawyer character was a pretty decent actress and sure we'll see more of her. Not great but I'm glad I dvr'd it. Based on true events which is scary because of how out of control the situation gets. I'm surprised how terrible people get that you'd think you can trust and the ones you shouldn't trust end up being good.
62,"WARNING! BEYOND HERE BE SPOILERS!
First, about 20 mins from the end of the movie, Sawyer & Lowell have just finished cooking meth for the day and they are sitting talking, shoes and socks off, relaxing and chatting while cooling themselves in the shade of the trees that line the creek banks.
The next scene shows them back at the trailer when suddenly Hollister and Buck show up to tie up a couple loose ends. Then lo-and-behold Hollister notices Wet Footprints on the unpainted wood steps leading up to the door of the trailer. He sees, not only Lowell's wet footprints, but another, much smaller set of prints as well. One would easily say a women's prints. So. The jig is up and he knows now his cousin has been lying to him all along and hiding the girl they've been frantically looking for! She's inside right this very minute!
Ah... what was that one part again? Did you say ""wet footprints on the steps""? Wet? Yes, really? Very obvious in the movie, huh? Well, see that a problem cuz they had to walk barefoot through the sand on the beach. Then through the woods, which are completely carpeted with foliage, sticks, seeds, felled and rotted trees in your path. Then I suppose by the time you got through the tall 3' grass surrounding the trailer, and across any kind of a pretense at a yard to those now infamous unpainted bare wood steps...
Do you Really think their feet would still be wet from the creek?
Secondly, at the end, like in Far Too Many Films, the good guy who finally takes down the bad guy
A) Doesn't properly check to see if they're Actually Dead, which Can, and Has been - for countless of plot lines - a major error (even fatal!) on their part!
and...
B) Just because you've shot or killed one bad guy doesn't always mean they're ALL dead or dealt with! Don't Throw or Drop. Your Weapon Until You're Absolutely Positively Without A Doubt Completely Know It's Over & You're Safe! You may still need a weapon and won't you feel stupid when you really really really need one and you realize you just had one, fully loaded and with spare mags, 20 mins ago, but Now You Don't?!
You. Just. Dropped. It. There. And. Then. Left. !
We, the audience, realize Hollywood likes for its heart of gold good guys to try and make some metaphorical ""moral high ground argument"" by making the almost-the-end-of-the-violent-gesture of throwing the gun away from themselves, after the peace-loving hero has finally been driven to violence, and it disgusts him.
Or women, apparently Hollywood thinks we like to just drop weapons wherever and whatever.
We, the women, the mothers, the nurturers, by far the vast majority of the world's population we can Thank from our hearts for taking on the responsibility of making sure children don't poke their eyes out, burn their fingers on the stove, use sharp knives, run with sizzles, freeze their tongues to the flagpoles, have easy access to household cleaners or prescriptions. We're the people they think would just drop a machete or an AK-47 anywhere on the floor? The floor we know some poor woman, just like us, is going to have to clean? Right. Just butterfingers do you suppose or hysterics?,
These are but two ( 2 !) more of my Hollywood movie pet peeves."
63,"I'm an old member here and I never wrote a review, the only reason I'm writing this is because I got so mad when I saw that the rating of this movie is 5.7 it's criminally underrated.I'm not saying that it's the best movie of the year and that you should get your hops up or anything like that. No, all I'm I'm saying is that if you enjoy good old thrillers, watch this"
64,"Really enjoyed this movie. Good twists. Builds up from average to being a great thriller. Do watch it. Acting is first class. A very well made movie, including props and scenery. You won't be disappointed."
65,"College graduate Sawyer (Hermione Corfield) is on her way to an interview for a job in Washington, D.C. She relies too much on her GPS (to avoid traffic jams on the bigger highways), and ends up on side roads thru many woods in Kentucky and gets lost. Stopping to check her paper map, she is approached by Hollister (Micah Hauptman) and his brother Buck (Daniel R. Hill) who you just know are up to no good. She is very uncomfortable and runs away from them. She is found later by Lowell (Jay Paulson) a cousin of Hollister and Buck, and Lowell makes Meth for sale.This is a very good drama and the acting by all is first rate. The whole production is first rate and deserves a wider audience. There are some twists and turns for you to discover. Can't tell you everything. Well, you will like the ending.Notables: Sean O'Bryan as Sheriff O'Doyle; Jeremy Glazer as Deputy Katz; John Marshall Jones as Commander Slattery of the State Police.Woman Director Jen McGowan did an incredible job. Kudos.Hermione Corfield is a keeper, and we will see more of her I am sure. She is every bit as good as Jennifer Lawrence was in Winter's Bone. So stay with this as it is an excellent story of a girl lost in the woods with ill-intent brothers looking for her and we hope cousin Lowell is not like them. (9/10)Violence: Yes.
Sex: No.
Nudity: No.
Humor: No
Language: Yes, but brief.
Rating: A"
66,Enjoyed this movie immensely. Good dramatic thriller. Corfield and Paulson are really good in their roles.
67,"I've seen a lot of movies and few that I would want to see again, but Rust Creek is one of those. Great story right up until the end, and the integrity of the main character is not compromised. Great directing, acting and the editor deserves a ton of credit too."
68,"This film was beautifully made. Everywhere from the script to the screen. Rust Creek is suspenseful, and it definitely keeps you at the edge of your seat. If you're looking for a movie to watch for date night, or simply just a movie to watch in your free time, this movie is for you. This movie is also relatable, as I seem to get lost all the time. One wrong turn can lead you down a road you don't want to go down, and that is terrifying. I wouldn't listen to any of the other reviews that say it's just another low budget thriller; I dare you to actually take a chance on this film, and escape into the world of rural Kentucky."
69,"Watched this movie last night and I can assure you that this is a pretty good thriller. The location, sound effects, camerawork and acting was quite mesmerizing. If you like a good cat and mouse chase in the woods then this one is for you. Just felt bad the Pritcher had to die, he really did everything to ensure the girl stays alive.I'd definitely recommend this movie for thriller fans and it really kept me engaged and at the edge of my seat throughout. 10/10 for me."
70,"Rust Creek is routine stuff and it's alright. There's nothing particularly memorable, but it's realistic and engaging enough.I would say don't get out of the car and keep the engine running when in the middle of nowhere and I'd say she still had time to jump in the car and drive away as well, but Corfield's good again. Though this character hasn't the depth or opportunity her later role in ""Sea Fever"" allows."
71,"An indie drama-thriller that veers away from its conventional 'survival-in-the-woods' roots, Jen McGowan's sophomore feature is quite a satisfying fare. The first 20-30 minutes is what I'd refer to as its setup. Sawyer (Hermione Corfield), a bright young college-goer on her way to a job interview in DC, unexpectedly gets stranded in the Kentucky woods with two vicious outlaws hot on her trail. It's what we've mostly seen in thrillers like these, the only difference here being Google Maps playing the unexpected villain.As opposed to most films where the protagonist is not even given a chance to fight back, Sawyer does. She battles her assailants and flees into the woods, bleeding profusely. Instead of heading the usual 'hunter versus hunted' route, the screenplay introduces more characters, amping up our interest quotient. DOP Michelle Lawler magnificently captures the limitless beauty of nature amid these woods. That shot of the moon in full bloom perceived through dried tree branches was simply breathtaking. The cinematography really draws you into the film's vibrant setting.The thrills, however, are kept to a bare minimum. A good part of the film's second act revolves around meth-cooking and the nuances of drug trade in rural Kentucky. Jay Paulson plays Lowell, a supporting character that's in a way, more intriguing that the protagonist herself. The climax showdown features a well-crafted set-piece, that plays out without sinking too deep into genre clichés. When I look back, the film's crux remains the elaborate relationship forged between Sawyer and Lowell, replete with philosophical exchanges. It slackens the pacing a fair bit, and works against the film's overall tone at times.Nonetheless, I liked Rust Creek for what it had to offer. I wouldn't recommend it to many thriller buffs, but for those who don't mind slow-burn thrillers with dialogue-driven character builds, it's worth a watch."
72,"This is a very tight thriller, that is a bit scary, tense and even uplifting at times. The acting is mostly very good and no one does anything that makes you totally 2nd guess their motives or if they should have. It was surprising and never predictable, has great scenery, music, and filming. Not sure why it has a very average rating, as it is QUITE close to excellent in all ways!"
73,Well paced and interesting with a few twists.I didnt rate it 7 as I felt some bits were a little predictable.Okay movie with Doritos n dip
74,"This was a film I got turned on to from a site that I write news articles for. This was listed in the January releases of new horror films and I added it to a list for when I needed a 2019 release to watch to keep up with my year end list. I came in blind aside from that so I was interested to see how this film played out. The synopsis is an overachieving college student gets lost on her way to a job interview. A wrong turn leaves her stranded deep in the Kentucky forest.We start this off with our star Sawyer (Hermione Corfield). She is at a track and she gets a voicemail. The Thanksgiving holiday is coming and instead of coming home to spend time with her family, she's going to Washington D.C. for a job interview. We learn later that she didn't tell anyone just incase she doesn't get the job.Things take a turn though when she hears over the radio about an accident that is slowing things down. She re-routes her GPS that takes her off the highway into a rural, woods area. The map directs her to a road that is closed. She continues on, hoping that it will give her an alternative route. The problem though is that it doesn't, it continues to want her to take a U-turn. She pulls into a place to see if she can get it to correct itself. It then shifts to a perspective from the woods. Someone asks another person there if they think she saw them, but when it shifts back to Sawyer, she cannot.Sawyer finally gives up on the phone and finds a map. She pulls over to use it to figure out a new way to go. That is when a couple of local brothers pull up. Hollister (Micah Hauptman) is the small of the two and the brains of the duo. The other is Buck (Daniel R. Hill). Hollister asks if he can help and she finally gives in to ask for directions. Things take a turn though when they attack her. She does get away, leaving her vehicle there. She goes into the woods, but she was stabbed in the leg from a knife that Buck had. The men give chase and have to find her.We end up learning that these two are always in trouble. The local sheriff, O'Doyle (Sean O'Bryan) is hard on them, but will also go to bat as they're locals. This draws some questions from his deputy Katz (Jeremy Glazer). A report comes in about the abandoned vehicle and O'Doyle doesn't seem too interested. Katz on the other hand wants to figure out what is going on.Sawyer is all alone in the woods and has to try to find her way. She is taken in by Lowell (Jay Paulson). He cooks meth in a trailer and we learn he's cousins with Hollister and Buck. There's an interesting plot here with these three and the area that they live in. The thing is can Sawyer get away before it is too late or does she know too much?This film has a plot that isn't exactly new, but I will admit, it did things that kept me interested. I like the establishment of Sawyer for sure. The synopsis states she's an overachiever, I didn't necessarily get that, but I do think that it does establish well is that she is constantly on the go and is trying to make her own way. I know she's nervous about failure, which I can definitely connect with. Her will to fight and that she's smart works well being lost in the woods like she is.There's also the interesting dynamic of these three hicks that she has a run in with. The backwoods vibe is one that can be quite scary, especially since I'm from a small area that is pretty tight knit. Going from there though, I like the reason that Hollister and Buck go after her is something that we don't necessarily see in films a lot and I thought it was an interesting take. Lowell is intriguing to me what he does for her when he really doesn't have a reason to. The more the plot is revealed, the true nature of all these characters comes out.I wanted to move next to the pacing of the film, which I actually didn't have an issue with. I think it does well in establishing our heroine and then putting her in the situation she is trying to survive. It feels like at a good interval are we given the back story to the characters that she meets so that really kept the movie interesting. I will say that it is a bit too long. I do think some of the aspects between Sawyer and Lowell could be cut. I think we definitely need some of it, but it does linger a bit too much there for me. I did like the ending and we had some good foreshadowing with things that are introduced.That takes me to the acting of the movie. I personally liked Corfield. I thought she brought strength to the character and also a bit of naivety. What I like here though is that she really doesn't do anything wrong aside from getting out of her vehicle to find a way back to the highway. It really is scary, because I could see myself doing something we see here. Hauptman and Hill I thought were both solid as well. They don't really seem like horrible people, but they decide to do bad things and the reason behind it makes sense. I also thought O'Bryan was solid and I really like Paulson. His motives don't really make sense, but I thought the more we get to know him, the more I liked him as a human. The rest of the cast I thought rounded out the film for what was needed.I think next I should go over the effects of the film. To be honest, there really aren't a lot, but it doesn't necessarily need them. This is definitely a lot more psychological as we kind of get a variation of Stockholm syndrome. I will say that the blood we get and the wounds we see do look real. There was some CGI fire that happens during the climax that doesn't look good. It is hard to harp on it as fire is a difficult thing to do this way and some films I love fall into this issue. I also thought the movie was shot very well. It really establishes the woods as an oppressive thing as Sawyer can't just walk out to freedom. If she goes too far, she'll get lost.Now with that said, I didn't love this movie, but it definitely was enjoyable. I was actually questioning while watching this if it is actually horror and I think that it is a dark enough feel to fit the genre. The concept isn't anything new, but there's enough of a variation that it does work for me. I also think that the acting is pretty solid across the board to help bring these characters to life. The tension is built throughout the film, but I will say that I think it does run a bit long. Not that it got boring; there are just some parts that weren't really needed in my opinion. There's not a lot in the way of effects, but the practical ones we get worked. I did have some issues with the CGI fire I saw here though. The last thing is that the soundtrack really didn't stand out or hurt the movie overall, it did fit from what I could tell. I would say that this one is above average overall and would actually recommend this to genre and non-genre fans alike."
75,I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie! The cinematography was dark while also being beautiful and I really enjoyed watching the relationship/ connection build between Sawyer and Lowell. Five stars
76,"At various points in this film I found myself asking, why go through all this trouble? Sawyer isn't any real threat to the meth operation. Hell, she's even helping Lowell with his latest cook. This vague interview in DC is totally forgotten by the second reel anyway. Even if she was a threat, why not just kill her? Nobody would ever find her. But then we wouldn't have this movie, which is the worst parts of ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Deliverance"".But such logic is nowhere to be found in this ridiculous script, where characters exist only to advance a plot that makes no sense, later to die (the deputy) or disappear (Slattery).Let me address one obvious problem. Sawyer isn't very bright. She wouldn't have survived the first night because she inexplicably discarded her sweatshirt. Judging from the dialog and the foggy breath from other characters it was a cold night and she would have died overnight from exposure. The biggest problem is her character is easily the least interesting in the film.The final scene at the creek sums captures the essence of everything wrong with Rust Creek. We see Sawyer sprinting through the woods. Moments later she is crawling out of the woods just as a vehicle pulls up. A good samaritan perhaps? Oh no! It's O'Doyle! (Such synchronicities are a feature of this movie.) So what does O'Doyle do? In real life he would simply shoot her and dump her body back at the meth trailer and call it a day. Here we get a preposterous scenario where he leads us to the eponymous creek where Sawyer, somehow re-energized, has a chance to emerge victorious."
77,"It held my attention for awhile, then the storyline was too far-fetched. Most of the actors committed to their characters, but it was too slow of a movie and the twists and turns eventually became predictable."
78,"Have any of you ever seen a real thriller? Did y'all get paid for these reviews? I am at a loss for words. Cliche after cliche. Is anyone actually as dumb as Sawyer? Do not waste your time. It would make for a good drinking game, take a shot anytime she does something stupid. You'll be drunk in no time."
79,"Nice dialogue secquences really brought out the intensity in the cilmax sequence and I thought everyone did a good , fine work, shoudl be very proud of themselves. One lil' thing though, spoiler , why didn't the dirty cop just blast ol' girl at the end instead of attempting to drown her and sodden himself and his socks and boots and all that?"
80,I was surprised and delighted that I stuck with this film long enough to become immersed. The actors are very good and the story holds together. I really enjoyed it
81,"From the get go, I found myself asking why the main character was making dumb choices like, not turning around when she arrived at the closed road. Why would she get out of her car to read a map? Why leave her hoodie behind instead of using it to control the bleeding. I stopped watching..."
82,"This movie is mediocre at best. I recommend this movie only if you're extremely bored and have run out of other options to watch. The movie starts out extremely slow and each little scenario drags out. It killed it for me completely as the woman was wandering aimlessly throughout the woods searching for service. What do you need phone service for? Everyone and their mother knows that emergency calls work with or without service. Whomever wrote the script should be penalized for not catching on to something so obvious. Then we have the hillbillies drive her car off a cliff in the middle of the woods? The same woods full of steep terrain, thick trees, and rocks. Absolutely impossible for her vehicle to make it through to the deep woods. But sure I get it's for Hollywood. Overall please save your time and don't watch this movie unless you're personally family or friends of the cast/producers. Even then it'd be in your best interest to tell them the truth about this film."
83,"This was your basic ""cute, tiny college girl gets lost in the woods and battles rapist meth dealers"" film.
Cute, perky college girl leaves college in KY to go for a job interview over thanksgiving weekend (wtf?). In an effort to avoid the holiday traffic, or heroin takes an alternate route and somehow gets lost in the middle of backwoods country, Where she is almost immediately assaulted by to backwoods rednecks.
The girl escapes and finds her way to a trailer in the middle of the woods, inhabited by a friendly meth cook. The cook givers her shelter and helps her plot an escape, until everything goes sideways. The girl and the cook then must escape his creepy cousins (the aforementioned hillbillies) and the crooked local sheriff (who has been orchestrating the entire operation).
Most of the film was very by-the-numbers and personally I didn't find anything original or unexpected. However, I was surprised to learn the main actress (Cornfield) is almost 30, considering she looks barely old enough to drive!"
84,"The story didn't make any sense and was completely ridiculous, but the acting and cinematography made for an overall watchable flick. Wouldn't necessarily recommend though."
85,"Spunky college student Sawyer (an excellent and appealing portrayal by Hermoine Corlfield) runs afoul of pernicious drug dealers after she gets lost in the deep Kentucky woods. Sawyer forms an uneasy alliance with mysterious loner and meth cooker Lowell (a fine and credible performance by Jay Paulson) in order to improve her chances of getting out of the wilderness alive.Director Jen McGowan relates the absorbing story at a measured, yet steady pace, offers a vivid evocation of the downhome country setting, builds a good deal of tension, takes time to develop the characters, and makes excellent use of the gorgeous forest setting. The sound acting by the capable cast helps a lot: Sean O'Bryan as brutal corrupt sheriff O'Doyle, Mieah Hauptman as the sinister Hollister, Daniel R. Hill as hairy behemoth Buck, Jeremy Glazer as eager deputy Nick Katz, and John Marshall Jones as ramrod state trooper Slattery. The strained, but sincere relationship between Sawyer and Lowell gives this picture a surprising amount of heart. Michelle Lawler's striking widescreen cinematography provides some breathtaking shots of the beautiful sylvan scenery. Well worth a watch."
86,"While this movie isn't Hollywood ""royalty"", it is better than the snobs say!It does have way more story than it needs & takes longer than it should to tell it, but in all, it's a fun roll!Yes, it's cliche & yes it's predictable in spots, but these are very unheard of actors. We should give them their due for this film.It could have been made better with a huge budget, but all-in-all, I was very pleased to watch this. I thought Hermione Corfield was SPLENDID - someone I hadn't heard of prior.So, I would say, try it out on a rainy day and just don't be too hard on it or yourself! It's not half bad."
87,"A young female college student named Sawyer is excited to be invited for an interview in another city. While driving to her destination her GPS tells her to take a detour to avoid traffic, leading her down towards ""Rust Creek"". Sawyer finds herself lost and pulls over to find her bearing. Soon she is approached by two men who offer assistance but really have other intentions for Sawyer. Sawyer escapes the two men and becomes stranded in the bush. She is alone and badly wounded. Can she survive the two strangers who are determined to hunt her down?To my surprise Rust Creek doesn't muck about with its story from the start. The film gets right into the action and it isn't long until Sawyer finds herself in some serious danger.The location of this film is wonderful. Rust Creek feels dark and gritty and just looks unsafe. There are also many creative shots done by the director Jen McGowan.Performance are generally positive and it's quite impressive that the film was able to keep my attention considering the small cast and what starts off as a basic plot.Although some moments in the first act are slow as Sawyer is required to either attend to her wounds or stop to express pain and agony, the second act of this film slows the pace even further. One character in particular also completely changes and honestly this fast transition didn't make sense.Overall, considering this film has a small cast and it carries an extremely basic plot, this film at its core is rather enjoyable. Rust Creek manages to deliver a few surprising moments even when it slows down in the second act. Filming shots here are also rather creative and the choice of dark and creepy location was wise. I'm personally keen to see what director Jen McGowan does next because this film is definitely a positive step in right direction.5.2/10
Walkden Entertainment"
88,"A testament to this film's power, I was rooting for Sawyer in minutes. Can't help falling in love with her, and there's another character or two who pull on the heartstrings. This film is creepy and beautiful at the same time, kept me on the edge of my seat without overdoing it with gore or shock value. The masterful storytelling at the heart of this film keeps you in steady suspense while the acting and directing keep you deep in the Kentucky woods..."
89,"Loved this thriller! Normally, I'm a basic dude who loves Bourne and Bond and I thought this was going to be a predictable, ""goldilocks gets lost"" tale, but boy was I wrong. Honestly, the cinematography reminded me of The Revenant, the plot was full of surprises and I was on the edge of my seat! This is a top-tier flick and Hermione Corfield is clearly a star on the rise."
90,"Loved this film. Equal parts beautiful and suspenseful. Nuanced characters. You feel like you're right there in the woods with them the whole time. I watched parts of it with my hands covering my face because it was so tense, in the best way."
91,"A thrilling survival tale that is boasted by strong performances, especially by its leading lady Hermione Corfield, a star in the making. It's wonderful character exploration is supported by some chilling imagery and cinematography."
92,"This movie seems to know I love survival stories and I'm terrified of rednecks, which is really unfair.The actors are great, especially the lead actress. The plotting is sharp, and it's not overdone. I appreciate how much of the drama hinges on small, realistic things, like wet socks or an infected wound.Would recommend to anyone who likes survival thrillers."
93,"Lower rating due to an oft repeated tale of a female alone on a back country road and on the horizon, and obviously coming soon, are some back country male nasty illiterate baddies to make her day a bit hellish. The wrong turns portion of the script was a bit weak, i.e. a wrong turn. The usual southeastern U.S.home brew drug (meth) labs, and who else might be complicit? Will she make it out in one piece? And, how many dumb mistakes (unfortunately usually females) to prolong the agony. Kudos for the acting; as baddies performed to expectations, and our lead female (who's a Brit by the way) nailed down her spirited southern college damsel-in-distress character."
94,"I quite like films like 'Rust Creek'. Films with no major stars, no special effects and just a (reasonably) grounded story to keep you hooked to the screen. They don't always work, but quite often they're the hidden little gems that no one is talking about. 'Rust Creek' isn't a masterpiece by any means but it is above average for what it is trying to be.The cast in this movie really impressed me. As I said I didn't recognise a single member of it, and yet there wasn't a weak performance in sight. The villains in particular impressed me. Some truly menacing performances that gave you that uneasy feeling that any good bad-guy performance should.The film had more of a heart than I expected it too as well. A large part of the film is about the development of a relationship and I thought it was excellently done. The arc they used felt natural and believable. The only flaws I could see with the film were that they could perhaps have shaved 10-15 minutes off the runtime with some tighter editing (however in a way I'm glad they didn't because that gave way for the arc I just mentioned to feel as natural as it did). Also the beginning of the movie was a little abrupt for my liking (again not really helping my case for a shorter runtime). This could have been padded a little more and set a more solid base for the film. At the end of it all though I had a pretty good time with 'Rust Creek' and would recommend people give it a look."
95,Truly enjoyed watching rust creek because I was rooting for the main character. The suspense in her journey kept me on my toes throughout the entirety of the film. Would recommend to anyone.
96,"Don't listen to the bad reviews. If you're a fan of 'I spit on your grave' then watch this movie. It starts fast, slows down in the middle and picks up again towards the end. Great little time killer."
97,"Beautifully photographed, with a stellar performance by Corfield, this is not your typical thriller. Lipson's screenplay unexpectedly plumbs some psychological depths. Definitely worth seeing!"
98,"Rust Creek can be termed as a traditional suspense-thriller. Throw in a compelling story line, solid direction, great acting and wonderfully composed visuals and you have a movie that can be seen as a grade above the rest. To boot, the female protagonist is incredibly strong-willed fully capable of taking care of herself. I must say, I was impressed."
99,"Rust Creek is an average thriller. When I start to see this movie I think it is another torture and bloody killing drama as 'Wolf creek 1 & 2 ' , Scarecrow, or Wrong Turn or most horrible ' 'Martyrs' where victims have no survival and no one do any daring to stop killer. But thanks to director I had not to see such foolish drama. Rather than at least here leading lady is courageous and fights against bad guys. However tension is stretching unnecessarily till ending losing impact of good thriller. Any way it is watchable for once without not many expectations. Acting of leading lady is well."
100,"This movie seems to know I love survival stories and I'm terrified of rednecks, which is really unfair.The actors is great, especially the lead actress. The plotting is sharp, and it's not overdone. I appreciate how much of the drama hinges on small, realistic things, like wet socks or an infected wound.Would recommend to anyone who likes survival thrillers."
101,"This movie was def a nail biter. It is suspenseful and thrilling. I personally thought it was awesome. Acting was great! It really left you wanting to know more about the characters... And even the bad guys.. you sorta liked. It was a very human movie, the lead was a spunky ( never superheroish) but believable spunk & smarts. Anyway, def worth the time. I was very surprised how well done it was!"
102,"Slows down abit after first 30 minutes into the movie.
Shows the ugly world of meth making and dealing."
103,Had a good premise but God didn't realize how naive young women can be... stay n car and turn around to a legit route dont just play dumb n naive and most of FAR FROM REALITY!! your telling me a woman soak n wet 100 lbs was able to fight off 2 grown ass men gtfo another movie trying to make it seem like women are as strong and smarter then men.. gtfo
104,Horrible and slow-moving. Of course another badass female beating up everyone. They should at least let her get better from sinus and cold infection before start shooting the scenes. The whole movie she sniffles entire time.
105,"The movie relies on a seemingly intelligent character to make many STUPID decisions. This type of writing is just lazy. If you cant logically progress the plot without your protagonist making absurdly dumb choices, then you ought to reconsider your film"
106,"This movie is not great, but (as others here have noted) it's not too bad. I am mostly writing this to respond to many negative reviewers who say that there are plot holes and that the main character does stupid things, and that the movie is generally not realistic. I actually thought quite the opposite. I have seen thousands of movies where the protagonist does all the cliched stupid things, but really that does not happen here to any appreciable degree. (I did think it was dumb to leave her sweatshirt behind; but hey, nobody's perfect.) The basic plot actually seems to hold water, and the heroine (and other characters) make reasonable decisions. (E.g. a few people commented that it was dumb for her to not just turn around when she got lost. But stopping to look at a map is not really a bad option versus turning around. Using the map could give her a more direct path back to the highway.) And it has just enough twists to distinguish it from the ""woman lost in woods with crazed hillbillies"" movie."
107,"It's your pretty typical mix of redneck hillbillies, a corrupt cop and an almost horror story abduction in a remote cabin off the beaten path. The theme has been done to death so there's not a lot new here. What I didn't find very credible was Sawyer (Hermione Corfield) just about going the Stockholm Syndrome route with good/ bad guy Lowell Pritchard (Jay Paulson), to the point of helping him cook up some meth for the family business. I did however like Lowell waxing existential about the randomness of events in life and how one unexpected occurrence can billiard ball into a series of offshoot outcomes. For a low budget, no-name cast movie, the special effects were decent, like the meth explosion that destroyed Lowell's trailer and did a number on his cousins Buck (Daniel R. Hill) and Hollister (Micah Hauptman). Hollister's post traumatic stress confrontation with Sheriff O'Doyle (Sean O'Bryan) was pretty classic as well, and with a fairly good make-up job to boot. The story's ending is rather abrupt without closure for Deputy Nick Katz's (Jeremy Glazer) wife; he never made it home with the whipped cream. Obviously, the film makers knew what they were doing when they entered the picture into a series of targeted film festivals - it won all seven categories in which it was entered! That's saying something, but I don't quite know what."
108,"Great thriller and fun to watch! The story was engaging and suspenseful. They built the world of the story nicely, as well as the relationships between characters. The lead actor, Hermione Corfield gives a great performance. It's a fun ride of a movie and will keep you guessing."
109,Wasn't expecting a great deal here but like others was pleasantly surprised. Well acted and good storyline with enough deviations from the norm to make it refreshingly different.
110,Not bad. The young lady acting lead is very good at acting the others were pretty good as well. I would have liked a little more plot twists but it isn't a bad watch at all.
111,"I thought this movie started a little slow but there were moments where my heart was genuinely pumping, which honestly doesn't happen to me a lot. Some elements were a little predictable but ultimately it delivered on being a thrilling thriller."
112,It's a good movie but not great and it could happen to people unlike Wrong Turn movie. It's entertaining.
113,Moral of the story - if Waze or any other navigation unit takes you off the main highway to a dirt path TURN AROUND immediately and go back. Our main character becomes lost due to faulty navigation but keeps going. She meets these two guys and the movie takes off from here.It's a decent thriller that has a twist or two. Maybe even a plot hole or two. But it kept my attention and is well acted by all. The characters are all pretty believable adding to the intensity of some scenes.Recommend if you like survival thrillers.
114,RUST CREEK WAS A GOOD MOVIE!! KEPT ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT!!!
115,"I think that this movie was pretty good for the most part...a tad bit slow every now and then...I think that I would've enjoyed it even more if I hadn't seen ""Revenge""...which was great...this movie also reminded me of ""Unsullied""...for that being said it was entertaining and worth a go...but if you've seen the other two movies I just mentioned it won't be anything new to you...but hey...still entertaining at best..."
116,"So I saw Rust Creek last night at the Central Cinema. I didn't know much about the film, but the preview made it look like a Deliverance/ Winter's Bone hybrid, plus if Central screens it I figure it is worth watching. Overall while not a perfect movie, I was very surprised with how much I enjoyed the film and the story it wanted to tell.The initial set up of the film is one we've seen a hundred times before. A young woman gets lost out in the country and is attacked by a group of men. Left for dead she does everything to survive both the wilderness and the criminal elements that are out to get her. From there the film combines components of a survival tale, a slow burn mystery noir, a suspense driven drug narrative, and an unorthodox revenge plot to craft a well made film that plays with your expectations as a viewer.Without spoiling the narrative the films greatest strength is that it's not what It seems. This is not just another revenge fantasy story we have seen a hundred times before. While the film certainly begins in that fashion, the bulk of the film deals far more with elements of drama and slow burn suspense. The film will grab you with its initial premise, but it is the well made Winter's Bone style exploration of the underground meth culture and its inhabitants that will keep you interested.Overall the movie is also well made, particularly considering its lower budget. The small cast all did a great job with their material and I really don't have any complaints. One of the film's greatest strengths was its use of setting to build tension and explore the socio-economics of the area. Plus there really was some well done camera work throughout the film.Of course there were a few glaring problems with the film. While a slow pace in itself is not a problem, the film certainly had some unnecessary padding. Realistically there's 15 or so minutes that could have been eliminated from the film to allow for a more fluid build-up of tension and suspense. There were certainly a number of times the film felt like it was dragging on despite not being an overly-long film in the first place. The female lead also felt a bit like a caricature at times. We really never got to know her as a character, which hurt the film a bit.Overall I enjoyed Rust Creek. It took a concept and premise we have seen many times before and made a different kind of film that played with yours expectations. Rust Creek managed to combine elements of suspense, mystery, action, and drama to craft a well made and entertaining film. I enjoyed it and would certainly recommend it to others looking for something a bit different. A 7.5 out of 10."
117,Rarely can the last two minutes ruin it for me but they did. Good plot and pace up until the painfully rushed ending sequence.
118,"This is a ""rednecks chasing after the outsider who stumbled onto their nefarious doings"" movie. A plot we've seen before, but executed differently enough to be entertaining.
The writer, director, and lead are all female, so I think that gives it a bit of a different outlook/pace than a male run film.
A little slow at the beginning but it picked up as it got going.
Well acted and some really nice Kentucky winter scenery as the main character (Hermione Corfield) flees from her attackers into the woods. She makes a couple of mistakes along the way, but it was mostly realistic, she is a college student, not Bear Grylls.
Without spoiling anything, the plot made sense to me...nothing major pulled me ""out of the moment"", and it had a satisfying ending."
119,"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It turned out to be a solid backwoods drug dealers hunt an innocent girl. This movie is really made by the acting that I thought was really good. The lead actress is very believable. I also liked the chemistry between the lead and her helper that she finds.The ending did not make any sense to me. As I've thought about it, I can't explain the characters' behavior other than to make an exciting movie ending. I think this hurt the movie overall."
120,Slow boring.. she makes illogical decisions over and over.. so annoying..I need my time back.... now!!
121,Getting lost in the boonies turns into a hill billy nightmare. Rust Creek reminds us why it's so important to just stay on the main roads and that relying on fold out maps never ends well for a millennial college student.
122,"This film is a great take on the ""lead character gets stranded"" narrative that we often see in thrillers.The most wonderful part about itais the acting. All of the actors did such a fantastic job it is hard to believe the circumstances in the film are not their real lives. Hermione Corfield is fantastic for this kind of raw-no bells and whistles-realist kind of character. The gruesome scenes were really well executed, and give you that kind of ""gross but i can't stop watching feeling"". After these scenes, it's hard to not want to find out how this girl gets herself out of this terrible situation. The cinematography captures beautiful images and really gives you a feel of what its like to be in this creepy tiny town.I wish the sherrif's involvement with drug trafficking and desire to ""beat the mexican cartel"" was delved into more. However, this film has no shortage of raw relationships between characters and a powerful desire for survival from the lead."
123,"""Rust Creek"" is the ideal classic thriller. Phenomenal acting, filming, and editing!! While the movie is mainly a suspenseful build-up, it keeps the viewers on their toes and causes them to be fully invested in the film. I also appreciated that none of the film was predictable and can not think of one issue I had with the film. Can't wait to recommend it to everyone !"
124,Watch the deleted scenes-not sure why they weren't included because 1 had important information about a character.
125,"Very suspenseful thriller that is well acted and even poignant. This is one of the best crime dramas I've seen in a long, long time. Beautiful scenery. Very literate and understated script. Watching this movie was as enjoyable as reading a favorite mystery novel. And it's a very timely movie for the subject matter as well. Just excellent."
126,"Typical horror movie but worse. A teen driving in the middle of nowhere ignoring her gps. Instead of going back the way she came she pulls over and gets confronted by hillbillies and then runs off into the wilderness. I had to turn the movie off I wasn't gonna punish myself anymore. Bad, Bad, Bad."
127,"Some stereotypes of course, good cinematography though, some twists and yes, totally, not as bad as I thought. An entertaining flick!"
128,"Rust Creek is not a bad film, it looks good, the score is nice. It has lots of emotion-over-logic moments because it was directed and co-written by a woman, which was interesting. While I don't find the second act believable at all, the story still felt coherent and the main lead showed some growth after what she went through.I'm giving it a six only because it feels 10 years too late, literally all the twists it has been already done before. Even the Stockholm syndrome-like relationship, every single twist and every single character cliche - old and stale.So, right around the second act, the only thing that kept me watching was the chemistry between Sawyer and Lowell. I perfectly knew how the story is going to end in detail just because every setup they did I could see a mile away.If you're looking for something different - Rust Creek is not it."
129,I don't understand some of these negative reviews. I thought this movie was suspenseful. The plot was great and the acting was excellent. 10 stars!
130,Not a great movie but much better than I was expecting.
131,"Surprisingly good, with the story taking an unexpected turn. Took awhile to pick up momentum, but once it did, it was really a suspenseful, thoughtful and well written movie. There were a few moments that strained credulity, but overall a watchable, worth while film. Good acting by the female lead, Hermione Corfield. Hope to see her in future good roles. Also, Jay Paulson puts in a very good performance. Recommend this one."
132,"I bought this movie because its IFC Midnight and has Hey Paulson in it. It started off weak, showing the girls wounded leg 30 times before moving into the dark heart of the story. Its director Jen McGowan's sophomore film but her first in the genre. However, it honestly feels like a first film. After about 30 mins the movie picks up and it slowly becomes more and more engrossing. If you ask me what makes this movie is the relationships and how the movie feel so in tune with real-life. Jay Paulson plays Lowell a backwoods meth cooker who takes the main character Sawyer captive for unknown reasons and tries to protect her. An unlikely friendship is formed damn Sawyer helps Lowell find himself in a world where he's felt so lost since he was 14. The kills in this movie are very effective because the relationships are examined on such a deep level. You feel for the person getting killed whether they're good or bad. Jay Paulson gives a very good performance in a role that makes him seem tender yet creepy. Amateurish but good I give it a 6.4 strictly for relationships"
133,"...only with a female lead. Good photography and score, decent acting, overused plot line with more holes than Without A Paddle (and none of the comedy). Nice enough for an evening at home."
134,"Terrible movie, boring characters & an obvious story line topped off with a rubbish ending!."
135,"After watching so many films over the lockdown and not many comming out, I was running out of things to watch. After scouring netflix, sky ect after skipping this a few times I finally decide to give it a go. It was thanks to the good reviews on here that I watched it.Not a bad movie at all, it entertained me and kept me watching till the end without losing my attention.
The protagonist is just an ordinary girl who does not suddenly become some revenge fueled hero as the film progresses. It felt real and believable. Not overly done hollywood style.
Overall it was Nicely shot, well acted and filmed in a great location. Decent little survival thriller."
136,"While the movie might start off slow, it picks up incredible pace and has quite a few twists I didn't see coming. I got pretty attached to lowell, too. It's definitely worth the watch"
137,"Rust Creek is a classy version of I Spit on Your Grave type of movies. It is well made with a realistic script and has no gratuitous  scenes at all. In addition the main male lead is both good and bad which is a twist. On the downside the female lead survives a knife fight which totally threw logic out the window. Another cliche is the corrupt sheriff who looks like the sheriff from the previosly mentioned movie. The heroine isn't raped or sexually abused which I was grateful to see.
The girl is a thin innocent intellectual type not suitable for a sexual abuse type movie. This is a recommend from me despite the noted cliches."
138,"I guess I have some mixed feeling on this film... Some of the acting was good, like the 2 main leads, but most of the other actors (the sheriffs especially) were average at best... or maybe the writing/script was more to blame? There are some tense scenes and the movie does draw you in, wanting to know what's going to happen, but at the same time, Sawyer, the girl running for her life, (and some of the others) makes some stupid, common sense mistakes that are just frustrating to watch (In My Humble Opinion.) That said, I loved how the movie centered on this young women's strength, bravery and determination. A great protagonist for the young ladies follow. This movie is entertaining enough, but nothing I'd go out of my way to recommend. (Not sure why the R rating... no nudity or language that I can remember.)"
139,I liked the way they humanized the 'meth' guy and the friendship that slowly developed between them. I was not expecting that. I like this genre and was glad I didn't find myself asking did it really need to be so graphic !? or how stupid is this person!
140,"If you like Revenge, last house on the left, you are going to love this one, only less gory than those two."
141,"This movie was slower than it should have been. Other than that, the plot, action, acting, cinematography and script were all fine. I would recommend playing it at 1.5x speed. That's what I did.
Not something I would keep in my DVD collection but good way to pass an evening."
142,"Boyfriend chose this movie for no particular reason. I forced myself to stay up and watch it because I was drawn into it. Lowell is my favorite character. They portrayed him as a caring individual instead of the common crazed method head. From the beginning though, you could come to the conclusion that once she took a detour, she was ducked. It was obvious who the bad guys were in this as well from the general attitude of the character. I however really enjoyed it, and the overall empowering message at the end.Doesn't hurt it was filmed in Louisville too, considering I'm about 45 minutes from there. Will have to go check it out soon"
143,"I had never heard of this movie before seeing it. I stumbled across this on IMDB while looking for something good to watch. I was very pleasantly surprised. Where did this come from? The acting, story, location, sound, story, & picture were all outstanding. It's about a girl getting lost on her way to a job interview. She pulls over on a backwoods road to read a map. Some hicks in a pickup truck stop & start giving her a bad time. These guys are mean criminals cooking meth out in the woods. They dump the excess red phosphorus waste from cooking meth into the creek which turns it a rust color, hence the name of the movie. She's one tough cookie who puts up a good fight against these guys but she's outnumbered, & soon injured from fighting back. She takes off running into the woods to hide. The guys wreck & hide her car then focus on trying to find her. She's injured, lost, & alone out in the elements trying to stay alive & find help before they kill her. The movie kept me anticipating what would happen next. There wasn't any slow boring moments. I didn't want to fast forward. I highly recommend this movie."
144,"""Make a U turn, if possible.
Give me better directions, if possible."""
145,"I can't take it anymore. Nobody participating in the decision to name this movie has a funny-bone.
Seriously, RUST CREEK?! And not a single quip about it in the movie. I'd settle for they having someone in a canoe and dropping their paddle."
146,It's not a horror movie....!!Focus IMDP.It deserves 4.
147,"This is your standard 'college babe, stranded in the woods, being chased by toothless hillbilly Trump supporters' plot. However, ""Rust Creek"" takes the next logical step in that clichéd storyline... and has her fall in love with the Kentucky meth-cook with a heart of gold. Yes, you read that right. It all peters out to a wholly unsatisfactory ending."
148,"This movie was interesting but predictable. Most of the actors were alright. The ending was suspenseful. All in all, I'm glad I watched it."
149,"If she calls at 112 movie finished in 10 minutes
good movie, to be seen once on speed X 2.
too many movies on the same subject.
in 2018 there are online satellite navigation applications, which is a bit difficult to get wrong way."
