You could at least give us some nice soundtrack... but noooo, you had to destroy it all at once"
1,"I think if I explained everything that I hated about this movie, I would be here forever, so I'll just list a couple of the things that I hated most. (Just for context, I am ethnically Chinese.)1) Mulan doesn't resonate with me as a character at all. She feels like a hollow shell of the 1998 Mulan and has no emotions or personality. The most memorable scene for me in the 1998 Mulan was the scene with the song 'Reflection' and it was incredibly moving and emotional. In this version, I felt nothing when I saw it. Mulan was just so bland and boring in that scene.2) Lovable characters like Mushu have been removed for some reason. (To make it more realistic? To cut down on the plot?) A magic CGI phoenix has been introduced but even after watching this entire movie, I don't understand the point of this addition. The phoenix contributes nothing to the plot and unlike Mushu, doesn't have a lovable personality (or any personality at all).3) The action sequences were awful and seemed to me like they had been designed to fit a 5 year old's interpretation of 'cool'. This meant that they were actually extremely cringey and very over the top. There were moments where the characters were suspended for weirdly long periods in the air during jumps which made it very offputting to watch.4) The repetition of honour, loyal, brave and true throughout the film. Yes these are important concepts in Chinese culture but this doesn't mean they need to be repeated every few minutes. If someone were to play a drinking game every time these words were mentioned then they'd probably end up in hospital from alcohol poisoning. Imagine if someone created an American movie where the characters kept saying 'freedom' and 'the american dream' in every other sentence like a broken record player. Although these are important American ideals, that doesn't mean anyone wants to watch a movie where they are repeated a million times. The 3 virtues should have been introduced into Mulan with more subtlety and grace to make it actually palatable to the viewer.5) I disliked the addition of Xianniang. While I feel like her character could have been a cool concept, the execution was poorly done. We don't see enough of her and her backstory to be able to connect with her and her interactions with Mulan were shallow and artificial. I also can't accept that she had a 2 minute conversation with Mulan in the palace and decided to give up her life for her. Of course, I am not a witch who has been ostracised my entire life, so I have a different perspective from her, but I could not understand her decision at all. It feel like the director suddenly realised that the movie was too long and rushed to kill her off so we could finish the movie in time.6) Mulan's makeup during the matchmaking scene. I have no idea why they decided to give her such garish makeup, especially since none of the other girls at the matchmaker's looked like that. At the end of the movie, we return to the matchmaker's room where another girl is meeting the matchmaker and she doesn't have such awful makeup. Was this an attempt to be historically accurate? I understand that there are difference between our modern concept of beauty and the historical ideal, but I think they could have tried harder to find a balance between these two. There are plenty of Chinese historical dramas that manage this; where the actresses look gorgeous to the modern eye even though they are dressed in the period style.7) I was extremely excited about this movie because I loved the 1998 mulan. It was one of the only representations of Chinese culture that I saw in western media as a kid. It was an amazing movie and made me proud to be Chinese. But after watching this movie, I feel like I've watched a bad parody where Westerners make weird assumptions about Chinese culture that I, as a Chinese person, can't comprehend.8) The magic chi. I can't even properly articulate my anger and confusion about this. I think that Mushu and many of the original songs were cut because they were unrealistic, but this magic chi business is completely unrealistic too! (for the record, chinese people cannot turn into birds and fly.) Mulan doesn't manage to save china through the power of hard work, perseverance and determination... she does it through this special handwavy magic energysorry about how long this review has become but i felt pretty strongly against this movie. Obviously other people will have different opinions to me, since we all have different likes/dislikes and come from different backgrounds. If you enjoyed this movie, I'm glad you did, but unfortunately I do not share your views.I'd recommend everyone watch the 2009 Mulan instead because that's everything this movie tried to be and failed at. The 2009 movie stayed true to the story of Mulan and is an absolute masterpiece in comparison to this in my opinion."
2,In the original Mulan is a normal girl who does amazing things through hard work. In this one she like Chinese Neo or something and has magical powers which kinda messes up the message.But the main problem with this version is that it's just cringy and boring.
3,"""Do you believe they are actually picking a Chinese girl to play the role as Mulan in the new real-person Disney remake movie?""
I can still remember the question from an ABC girl and the excitement on her face when she was asking the question back in 2017. And after all these years of waiting, it turns out to be a complete disappointment.A 3-star is probably the best rating that I can give here.
Yifei Liu is absolutely the ideal cast for the character of Mulan. It looks astonishing on that reflection of Mulan in the sword poster. And that wins the movie one of the stars.
Some of the scenery in the movie are beautiful especially with IMAX 3D. Mountains and skyline of the capital city are breathtaking, which earns the second star. It is probably a half star if not with IMAX.
As for the third, since IMDB won't allow me to give a ZERO star for the worst movie of all time, it is basically a buy-2-and-get-1-for-free star.Mulan's story has been told to all the Chinese of their childhood for over a thousand years. And thanks for Disney, the story is told to all the world with their great cartoon movie in 1998. The spirit of Mulan has been encouraging generations of people, including her bravery, loyalty and most importantly her filial responsibility. (Well, that's true, Chinese people thinks highly of their filial duty.)
However, all the spirits above are but of words engraved on the sword, and the director really wants to tell that little story about a girl seeking for her true-self, which could be any other story but Mulan's. Despite of that, the whole story line is not logical, well, at all.
* Avoiding to face the true-self as a female? Is that true?
* Hiding family Kungfu from the troop? Is that necessary?
* Taking off all armor and helmet to run for a war fight? Cannot be more logical.
* A troop of well trained soldiers counting the Emperor's life on and only on a little girl? Best strategy ever.
* Such an easily provoked Emperor that would rather get himself into a one on one fight to a berserker? Trump wouldn't do that for sure.If you want to make a good Chinese history based movie, the least thing you have to do is to do some real study on it.
But all I can see from this movie is prejudice from westerners to Chinese traditional culture and a soulless Disney drama.
* Praying to phoenix for safety and peace? We don't ever do that in China.
* Concubines with pale white faces and bloody red cheek makeups? That's what Japanese Geishas do.
* A mind-controlling or transforming witch? Okay, Valar Morghulis.
* Phoenix Vs Eagle metaphor? What's that for?
Basically, not a single culture is presented precisely from where they come in this movie.
If you can read Chinese, you can learn more mistakes that are made about the culture, history timelines, etc, where the ratings goes all the way down to 4.9 after 3 days of the release.
If you can't, don't bother, and just remember the mistakes are much more than you can even imagine.
The director successfully made a contribution to alienate the understanding between the westerners and Chinese.
Westerners may think this another movie that is made for Chinese in order to please the Chinese market, while Chinese people are actually feeling INSULTED by all these cultural bias.
Niki Caro shows us a great example how to make a movie and offend both side of the audience.In the original Mulan folklore, there are no characters like Mushu, the cricket, and all the funny souls of ancestors. But who would possibly complain about a cute funny dragon especially when it comes from Disney? But when a silent, helpless and do-not-know-what-to-do phoenix is taking Mushu's place, it just let people doubt if this 2020 remake is actually a Disney movie.
Besides, Mulan is made a superhero with great talent when she was very young. And of course, a heroine cannot have a boyfriend, potential one, as a general or something. That adaption sounds not feminist at all.All in all, this movie is simply a waste of a good legend, passion from Disney fans, 2 hours of your life probably, and above all, 200 million dollars.
Good job Niki Caro!"
4,"This is probably the worst movie I have seen in the last two years. And mind that Mulan still is one of my favourite cartoon movie, so thats quite something to achieve.Let me put it simple, every time the script diverged from the cartoon it was for the worst. They left out the best parts and added the most ridiculous nonsense you can imagine.
The Witch: Why add this character? How lazy do you have to be as a screenwriter to only be able to make the story ""work"" by adding a character that can morph into any other character? Betrayal? Complicated motives? Multilayered characters? No - it was just the witch who took over the Kings servant.The Phoenix: Absolutely useless trope. I would argue that the story of Mushu in the cartoon was written better that the whole Mulan 2020 script. This dumb phoenix from the ashes metaphor has been done a thousand times, please for gods sake can these people have one original idea?Loyal, brave, and true. These three words appear like 10 Times through the movie yet absolutely nothing comes from it that wouldn't naturally appear in a Mulan story. Its like making a Harry Potter movie and have the word ""Magic"" appear on every item. Yeah we know, it's a movie about bravery - we have all seen the cartoon.Scenery: The landscapes are beautiful, if this would be a documentary. Did anyone tell the director that the landscapes in a movie need to make sense? I felt like I'm watching an old spice comercial: I'm on top of a mountain, now I'm in the desert, look back to me I am now inside a vulcano.In Summary the movie had three very strong virtues. But I'm not talking about ""loyal, brave, and true"" the three words that come to my mind are ""ridiculous, dumb and lazy"". So yeah, don't watch, don't buy. Just watch the cartoon another time."
5,"I'm not sure what movie I was shown. It was titled after one of my absolute favorite movies, but is NOTHING like it. The movie has no Mushu, but instead replaces him with a silent bird. There is no musical numbers, and we never get down to business. The edits are terrible and make it look as if ""Mulan"" can be at 2 places at once. And I am waiting for someone to explain the woman that turns into a bird."
6,"Boring, some poor sfx and the witch is totally unnecessary. Why didn't she just go to the emperor and kill him? I found the actress playing Mulan unconvincing. She was so tiny, how were we to believe she passed as a boy and fought the way she did? Disney should just stop with the remakes and try and make something new. Or is Hollywood terrified of this?"
7,"Everything that made Mulan great has been dropped the charming side characters, the humour, the character development all of it in favour of this bland cringey Cliche be yourself girl power lunacy. Just don't waste the 30$ on this believe me you will thank me later."
8,"No music because when charging into war, ""you don't press pause and start singing cause it isn't realistic"" says Niki. Yet, in one of the most emotional and amazing war scenes in Lord of the Rings Return of the King starts with Pippin singing as Faramir charges towards the Orcs - and that film won 11 Academy Awards."
9,This movie is garbage. Not even close to the original classic animation. Utter waste of time.
10,"Disney can't make anything original same old story of remaking classic animation in live action didn't paid off. Bad action, choreography, screenplay is very dull and boring. Changed history of characters to make movie work.
Really bad action and costumes look cheap. I was lucky I didn't paid 30 dollars watch it at friends place. Felt like walking out halfway thru the movie."
11,"They turned Mulan into a Rey clone; that's all you need to know. Why bother creating a flawed and vulnerable character that gains the viewer's respect through hard work, perseverance and resourcefulness when you can just tack on magical plot-solving heritage and thus cut out the middleman entirely? Worked well with Rey, didn't it?Also, remember how in the original, Shan Yu didn't care one bit that Mulan was a woman? All that mattered to him was that she was responsible for destroying his army and he took her as seriously as any other enemy. Well it would seem that was just way too progressive for modern audiences because Mr. Khan over here can't go 5 minutes without reminding you how much he hates women...because, you know, overcoming segregation matters more than overcoming your enemy through skill and ingenuity.A 200 million dollar female power fantasy -- that's what this is."
12,This is one High Quality disappointment. Inferior to the original Disney Animation in every way conceivable. Dishonor on you! Dishonor on your cow!
13,"A Chinese girl disguises herself as a male warrior in order to save her father...this is mainly the plot and Nothing Else!The new wave of - Marvel/Disney and DC's - Origins and reboots are such a drag, easily spotted as a cash grabber and what's worse is they lack the means to fool the average audience to think that there's a point there, with out any care for a solid plot, interesting story telling, decent acting or even a POINT for telling a story to being with. Just colorful CGI and wrap it up and throw it out there as people eats everything big companies throw at them. Mulan follows the same disfigured recipe for failure with a boring story, lame non relatable characters, disfigured shadow of the old classic and a drag when it comes to acting.Overall a pointless continuous disaster for the money driven reboots that is not worth wasting time."
14,Apparently Mulan has super powers now and is the greatest warrior from the get go. This movie is corny and laughable. It was hard to root for mulan because her character was so boring.
15,"I am frustrated with the reviews here that only talk about the fact that this movie was not a comedy or a musical like Mulan (1998). I love the first Mulan movie and in fact Mulan is one of my favorite Disney characters. I still sing songs from that movie to my children each night. But if I wanted to watch Mulan (1998), I would just watch the original.This movie is not meant to be a re-make, it is meant to be a re-imagining of a deeper story. A legend. A story about a woman who wants to be TRUE to herself but still respectful of her family, her culture, and her country. I think that the comedic relief of the Mushu character would have taken away from the important message that we can all stand to learn from this legend. Mulan learns that what she has within her is NOT something to be hidden away, but a gift that she can share with the world. I also thought the score of this movie was beautiful and the subtle references to the original brought tears to my eyes.If you want to watch Mulan (1998), then watch that movie and don't pay the $29.99 to watch this movie. But if you want to watch a movie with beautiful cinematography, music, and a story that any person across generations can learn something from, then I suggest you try this one."
16,"Honestly, it felt like a generic Chinese fantasy martial arts movie with a mediocre story line and shallow character development. You can't include Mushu because you want it to be more realistic/traditional but you can add a shapeshifter into the plot? What? There's no Disney magic like the original Mulan (1998) that was beloved by fans. No humor, no songs, or the Disney feel to it. If it didn't have the name ""Mulan"" as its title then it would have been just another mediocre movie at best, forgettable but not terrible. But for a Live Action remake of the beloved classic ""Mulan"", absolute trash. Save your $30 and 2 hours of your life that you'll never get back. I mean I don't know how else to convey it but... man was it awful."
17,"Just stop. This Mulan is devoid of all the fun and charm of the original. I don't want to waste too many words on this, just don't bother watching it."
18,"Really? This storyline isn't the same. I had read articles before the movie came out but it really is a POS. Don't waste your time... really... laugh so you don't cry! Shame on Disney, shame on anyone that thought this live action would be a good idea and well received by the audience / true Disney fans!!!!!!!"
19,Not as expected frm Disney. Too much hype and less entertaining!
20,It was bad cringey and boring at the same time. it felt like a big budget overscaled chinese film failure I dont know what the hell Disney was thinking during the production. so not much of a big disappointment because I wasn't too excited after watching the first trailer so I wasn't gonna watch it but I had to try it cause I loved the Original animation.. but still it was worst than I expected
21,Artemis Fowl then and now Mulan... If there is any award for being expertly mediocre
22,"An ill-conceived narrative mess that does not compare well to the 1998 animated Mulan. An insult to Chinese identity because someone decided to make Chinese actors deliver lines in English (to pander to western audience).In an animation, it is fine to have Chinese characters speak English, because it is a story that does not seek to be ""real"", like a fairy tale. The audience will not be that bothered. The 1998 animated Mulan is an empowering ""fairy tale"" story with Chinese elements inspired by a folklore ballad.When Disney decided to do a live action remake with production design that seems to be aiming for authenticity, the game changes. It is just wrong to force Chinese Actors that can speak Mandarin, to deliver lines (emotion) in English. Language is integral to one's way of thinking, one's personal identity, one's cultural heritage and social image. Forcing Chinese actors to speak English, like they don't have their own perfectly fine full-functioning language that is just as full of nuance and complex communication, is the Ultimate Disrespect to Chinese culture.If they wanted 'authenticity' and to pander to Chinese audience, they should have done this live action remake in Mandarin, and dubbed into English (or subtitled) for western audience, and spent some money hiring Chinese scriptwriter, production staff, who will know the culture intrinsically. The acting would be better if the actors were allowed to use their native language. And from an authenticity viewpoint, it is odd to have a 'realistic' historical folklore Chinese drama in spoken English.From the pander-to-the-western-audience viewpoint, they would have done better to do a shot-by-shot live remake, with all the music and beloved characters of the animated classic."
23,"Uch, it was bad. And I had high hopes for this one, at least as an action film. But nope, it was an all around mess. First of all, it's Woke (of course it is), but that's only the start of the problems. Sometimes they have lame fighting styles, other times they just randomly throw in something out of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and not in a good way, but it's all really boring. They also took out all the interesting characters, like Mushu, Shang, Cricket, Mulan's grandmother, Mulan's 3 army friends, and instead we get these pointless nobodies who have little to no role other than simply being there. They even gave Mulan a sister, but she adds absolutely nothing; you can take her out of the movie and it changes nothing. Oh, and there's no Shan Yu either, instead we get these two generic, boring villains with no character. And let's not forget the inclusion of chi and actual magic and witchcraft. And, of course, Mulan is an overpowered Mary Su who, even as a child, was performing moves that would put Jacki Chan to shame. I mean, why not give her actual development in training and stuff to show her becoming a good fighter when you can just make her super OP Mary Sue right off the bat, right? The acting itself is bland, and even the dialogue is horrible. Everyone talks in these tone-deaf monotone voices with no emotion in them. You really feel nothing for any these characters. The movie has none of the charm of the original, and they don't even have any of the songs. Seriously, the movie is an utter disaster, and completely boring. They would have been better off doing a shot-for-shot remake like they did with the live-action Lion King. Get your act together, Disney, you're sinking your own ship."
24,"I hate live actions honestly and I think Disney it's over doing them. But Owell they are the ones with the cash.
It's beautifull to look at with plenty of SGI but all the show means nothing. There is pathos and gravitas but they are pointless!!! It's a pointless movie when you have the animated version doesn't had much and all the waiting was for nothing.
Plus paying 35$ on Disney plus for that?!??"
25,"Very poor movie, there are so many great Chinese action movies you could choose this is definitely not one of them.
Honestly not sure what they were thinking I cringed the whole way through,very cheesy and not sure who it's catered towards as falls flat for both western and Chinese audiences. I gave it a three rating mainly because of the scenery, the script is bad, the action is very poor really don't bother it's just a weak movie."
26,"The kindest words I can give to this movie is maybe the movie magic was lacking because I watched it at home.Nah. Even as an Asian, this movie was hollow. It's a disgrace to the original."
27,"I didn't know a movie could be so bad all around -- I looked forward to this and, Wow, what an enlightenment -- the 1 star is for the finishing animation and song/music."
28,Lead hardly gives any expression it's like same face from movie start to end which lead movie to deep sinkhole.
29,Disneys creed is immeasurable. They keep ruining their great animations which easy money grabs.
30,"Poor acting, mediocre directing and storytelling, lacklustre all the way."
31,"They want to make china version wonder woman. But the whole movie is just so boring, the action part is even less than the normal action movie trailer. It's a trash movie."
32,"Mulan is a visual feast, and nothing more. It's a bland, lifeless mess of a film with watered down stakes, poor characters, no humour, and no heart. If anything, it's shown just how masterful the 1998 animation is.Mulan was just an ordinary girl, who went on to do extraordinary things, burdened by societal constrictions and driven by love, loyalty, and honour. But this version of Mulan is wooden and hollow. There is no weight to her decisions, no urgency, because she's the chosen one. And although Disney has proclaimed this to be an empowering film for women, applying the 'chosen one' archetype to the female lead (if you ask me) is a funny way of promoting female empowerment. If anything, it's disparaging, disheartening, and a huge step back compared to it's predecessor."
33,I thought this movie has bad ratings because of the hk situation. But it deserves even worse ratings because it doesnt even come close to how chinese movies actually look like. This movie is bad overall
34,Warning this movie is simply terrible. So much wasted potential. Having to watch the 90s version to get the bad taste out of my mouth.
35,"Was excited for this movie to come out. What a disaster. Directing was terrible. I don't know why they would pick someone someone who has never done anything to direct such an important movie. This could have been great. The acting talent is there, but falls apart due to the horrific storytelling abilities of this hack of a director."
36,"SOOOO, that witch could have just flown to the emperor and murder him from the beginning...And here lies all the flaws that come from this poor movie. Bad acting, bad story, bad effects. Mulan will be easily forfotten and that's a good thing."
37,"I really don't know what to say about this train wreck of a remake, I am so disappointed I was really looking forward to it. Graphics and effects are poor, the storytelling was all over the place. It really didn't do Mulan and favours at all. And I think the castings could have been done a bit better. Sorry to say but this one is one to miss."
38,"I've never seen the cartoon version but my daughter has and she loved ir. I promised I'd take her to see this when it came out in the theater. Well, that didn't happen. Although the price tag was a bit high I decided to shell out the 30 bucks (I'd have paid 50 at the movies). We both found the movie enkoyable. It was dramatic, funny in parts, touching in other parts. The scenery was amazing. I'm not sure what people were looking for in this. Apparently there is a talking dragon and singing in the carroon. I'll pass on both. This reminds me of another Disney movie people under-rated because they didn't understand the point: Tron: Legacy. Just chill out and enjoy a movie rather than getting your quarantined panties in a bunch!"
39,"Disappointed. Love the animation movie, but most of that magic was missing from the live action. No songs, and all the comedic characters were cut from the original. Did not even feel like a Disney movie."
40,"I tried to enjoy the movie. I really did. But I really couldn't. My biggest issue was perhaps the fact that in this Mulan is a prodigy, ""chosen one"" kind of character. What really made the original character great was the fact that she achieved everything through intelligence and hard work. If you take that from her, she is virtually another character.
Then, I didn't really feel the acting. In some scenes I was expecting some emotion from the actors but they just kept a straight face and I really disconnected from the scenes.
Also, a few very important scenes from the first film were omitted or downplayed a lot. Take the scene where Mulan leaves for war for instance. I blinked and it was over.
From what I understand they got rid of Mushu and all the songs to make the movie more realistic, but yeah they added a witch and magic, which of course are a part of daily life (if you live in Harry Potter).
I was expecting epic battle scenes, but they really felt weird? Like Avatar the Last Airbender level of weird.
However I really enjoyed the costumes and the scenery, so the movie isn't fully irredeemable.
I wouldn't have mind the fact that it isn't a lot like the original if the movie was done right, but I felt that Disney got rid of all the parts that made the original great and I am truly unhappy with the result. Maybe some people enjoy this new way Mulan's character is presented, but I will stick to the original."
41,"What a TERRIBLE ending.. devoid of everything.
As a stand alone movie, it is nothing but serviceable. Before the final comfrontation, it was just fine.. it quickly nose-dived to absurdity and a lack of devotion to movie making. When compared to the original animation, it is clear that this one pales to the amount of detail and love poured on the first iteration.You can't deny the production value, some great scenes (preparation for Matchmaker) and strong visuals.. specially locations.But yet again, like with Aladdin, changes made to this life action adaptation are a detriment to the original story.
Mulan being able to finally climb the mountain doesn't come from effort or talent. She just does. The infamous Mary Sue syndrome. Can't get a female lead right..Chasing after the Khan alone, as an excuse to face the witch alone (in a secluded place), only for a pointless change of character. And the reveal to the troops, followed by her expulsion means a LOT less when her companions don't know the value of her deeds. No one saw her actions to bring down an avalanche, saving all of them (well, physically saving only one). This is a change for the worse in every way.. and only one example of their tampering.Lessened impact to scenes (reaching the horrors of war), lack of depth without musical tone. Switch between playful life and reality is non existant.Unearned character traits and arcs.And worse of all, the whole ""Join me, we will take our place together"" line.. a touch of Start Wars, to top it all off. With Chi being like the force.This version of Mulan simply gains everything by doing nothing.. unlike the original, where she still acts true to her feelings, by keeping the people in mind and putting REAL effort into her actions.. Even if it means a bigger disgrace.
In this one, she isn't just trusted by a small group, she is basically forgiven. She is suddenly the most important piece on the chestboard.
It isn't properly stablished, that she is on par with the witch.. She just IS their best warrior.
Even taking away from the Khan himself.. everything he accomplishes, it's because of Magic, and a tenues position of power over a Witch that is not credible. And the female antagonist, whose position isn't earned.I expected no less from Disney, but still managed to be disappointed."
42,"I enjoyed watching this remake and appreciate the choices made to make it stand apart from the animated. Not that it needs to be said, but the live-action remakes will just never surpass the greatness of the originals, and that's still true here. Nevertheless, a visually stunning film that was enjoyable to watch."
43,"Once again people are giving negative reviews to this movie for what it's not instead of rating it for what it is. Forget the scenery, the costumes, the action, the amazing fight scenes... they're mad because it's not the 1998 Mulan. Guess what? IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE! The targeted audience won't care. People complained the same about the 2019 Lion King. Can people just enjoy a remake without whining ""oh it's not like the first one, it's not like the first one"". I loved both Lion Kings and I like both Mulans. It's possible, you know, if you stop wishing and wanting so much. I think of all the girls born after 1998 that this movie will inspire, while the old are nostalgic about first versions of everything."
44,"Don't know why this movie was done. Not even close to the original. But i recommend to watch this movies instead. HERO, Curse of the Golden Flower and House of Flying Daggers."
45,"I liked the first part of the movie until when she just decided to come back and show everyone she is a female. I don't understand the meaning and intention of it at all. In real history, mulan's identity was never revealed until she retired, went back home and her friends visited her then people found out. A true soldier would never do such thing if they are really fighting against invaders. As a Chinese myself, I found it ridiculous the way they present it unfortunately"
46,"This movie has no soul. It is an awful movie with characters that make no sense, borong plot"
47,"It's Disney cheese with an extra pound of stink sprinkled on top. Here's the low-down:1. Donnie Yen was great as always. He's clearly THE martial artist and his acting was good too. Side by side, no one matches with him. His martial arts should not have been that stellar, when the heroine was supposed to be Mulan.
2. Mulan apparently was gifted with extraordinary fighting prowess without being taught anything as a child. A cliche that would have worked is if she was actually taught how to fight...by Donnie Yen maybe? Shoulder shrug to this blunder.
3. Was Jet Li in this movie? Great makeup work.
4. Mulan's village was a bad rip off from Kung Fu Hustle. Disney cheese was added to make the village clean and spotless. In fact, it was clean and spotless in every location of the movie, even extending to the wardrobe and objects. The dad's sword, which was used in prior battle, was spotless and unblemished.
5. Mulan's character could have been so much better developed. With good directing, she would have been much more endearing and charismatic. You don't randomly make her hair curled when she is fighting baddies. The actress did a good job for what it's worth - it's the directing that made her character plain silly and unbelievable.
6. I get it - Mulan is a woman in a male-dominated society. At the end, all the males bow down to her and all of Chinese civilization owes their gratitude. What I don't get is why this has to be in-your-face so obvious?
7. The CGI characters and fighting scenes stunk up the movie. It was also very stylized a la Hero, but the latter actually had stellar fighting choreography (Jet and Donnie obviously) and a coherent story line that was enriched by actual Chinese language, not English.If you want to waste $30 for streaming, have right at it and entertain the little kids. Otherwise, fire up Hero or Crouching, Tiger Hidden Dragon to see what real female empowerment (Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi) can accomplish in good movie productions."
48,"I'm glad this isn't some shot-for-shot remake like 2019's The Lion King. I'm glad they actually stuck with the Ballad of Mulan story rather than it be a remake of the animated movie. I'm glad that most of this movie's budget went around the way the land of ancient China should be presented. The music is great, the cinematography is beautiful, the visuals are incredible, the acting is solid, the editing and sound effects are good... and that's pretty much it.I'm giving this movie a 7/10 because it's better than most of the other Disney remakes (with Beauty and the Beast being the one that I happened to REALLY like), and because there is a lot to like about it. The only thing not great about this movie is the writing and the way some things are executed. I wish they spent more time developing the characters and used more of that time to develop the villain. The villain in the cartoon movie was so well-crafted and well-written, but the villain in the remake feels like there's a whole lot missing from him.It's a solid, mildly entertaining movie overall and definitely better than that garbage Artemis Fowl movie!"
49,"It's hard to put your finger on why, but this movie just leaves you cold. The characters have no depth, the set pieces seem oddly small scale and it is just deeply unsatisfactory. It seems they were focused on the feminist aspect of the story that they forgot about everything else"
50,"Disney decided to remake Mulan and when I first heard the idea I was all for it! They were going to turn one of my favorites into the real life version. Instead we received something that BARELY resembles Mulan. No singing. No Mushu. And where did that witch even come from?!?Shame on Disney for making such a bad movie, and shame on me for paying $30 to watch it."
51,"A very strong message from this live-action movie, big thanks to disney for this beautiful work, it was really amazing to watch something great this year."
52,"It started slowly and dragged on until it became ridiculous to the point it was unwatchable and they wasted the talent that was available. There are zero memorable characters, not one character had any substantial development, Don't waste your money."
53,"I first want to say I did not at all agree with the price tag Disney put on this movie, but because I've been waiting for it for so long I'm definitely glad I watched it. But $30 is a lot when I usually don't spend more than $10-15 for a movie in theaters, that's with the theater experience. A movie in the comfort of my home should be a lot less. That being said let's jump right into it.In the beginning of the movie, I feared that the acting would be subpar this is only because the young girl they chose to act as young Mulan felt like she was missing the level or professionalism that was expected of her. And the characters around her seemed to gravitate at first to this level set by young Mulan. This changed with a much older Mulan and the main actress who delivered her role absolutely amazingly.Mulan is a tale females need more than ever right now. For thousands of years men told women to be invisible, but some of the most courageous and smartest humans to help change the tides of history were women. It's funny how this message of a female ""knowing her place"" in the 21st century is still prevalent. It's really eye opening that it's 2020, almost 2021, and society still thinks in this old outdated way. I love the story of Mulan, animated version, but bringing it to life can really help broaden a young girl's horizons. For an adult woman, like myself, it makes me feel comfort and solstice through watching this movie. That I chose the right path for myself instead of listening to what society told me to do and expected me to do.Beyond that, seeing Mulan as a child being a tomboy running around being sporty and then being told girls aren't like that to know her place I felt that. I felt that on a deep level. My mom used to say that demeaning stuff to me all the time as a child and while I was growing up. It's like why would you try to make me into something I'm not? Or try to tell me to be a certain way because society doesn't except lively women? Not all women have to be princesses. Some females are destined to be warriors.I love the fact they replaced Mushuu with a phoenix. Since Mulan's story is all about being true to herself and her identity, growing into her skin, accepting herself as she is, being confident in that. It really suits the movie that not only was she solely able to see the Phoenix as her sign or symbol from a higher deity that she's in the right place at the right time in her life. That this choice is meant to be, but also the three virtues of loyal, brave, and true help her grow into that. Realize who she is and the game changes. It's absolutely an empowering feeling!The running up the walls was a bit much, but really I'll let it slide because some people do similar stuff with parkour. The journey of self was just stunning I can't say that enough. The Phoenix is a symbol of identity. Loyal, brave, and true,I usually cannot sit still through any movie for that matter, but I sat through this long one no problem at all. The only thing I paused for was to capture my feelings in the moment what I was feeling. I have a deep appreciation for this film."
54,"Such a disappointment ... and how can you whitewash an all Asian Cast movie ? Make them act in English .... just ridiculous. The movie might have a better sentiment in Mandarin but still even if it was in Mandarin I am sure it would be bad...
well done Disney you are able to destroy yet another classic"
55,"This movie is what's bad. The only thing redeemable about it is the visual effects. Everything else fails to succeed. The action scenes are way to goofy and unrealistic to enjoy, the comedy falls flat every single time, and the cuts are awkward and make the movie hard to watch. The most iconic song from the original movie was ""I'll make a man out of you,"" but when they deliver that line and head into montage in the remake, the song doesn't play. The entire movie doesn't know what it is besides ""Mulan"", and things constantly feel missing."
56,"This. Just wow. This was an incredible let down. Everything about it was just terrible. The casting, the acting, the sets, the shooting, the costumes, it looks like they made it on a 50k budget and blew the rest of flying round the world for the locations.Just goes to show money can't make great movies. So sad"
57,"This year couldn't be worse, but then I watched Mulan. Full of cliches and boring."
58,Nothing makes sense. The most terrible film that I've ever seen in my life. I'd rather watch the original cartoon instead of wasting my money on this version.
59,"Terrible story telling. and it's NOT because it's not the original animation version.
The story is not at all convincing how the other characters transform from untrusted of women in battlefield, furious at her lying and betrayal to trusting her completely without any foreshadowing. People won't be turning their back on someone in the first min to trusting and letting them lead on the next one just because she went there to provide the inside information. This is not how human mind works. The animation is well liked because it works as a story, and this film failed because the story failed, not because it's not the animation version. This movie tries to focus on the mental aspect of a woman fighting to create a space where it wasn't allowed, however how the situation transformed to her advantage is the weakest of all. The stars are for the fighting scene and costume."
60,"Do you want to see a full remake of the animated movie? Why? The animated movie it's amazing and if you want to watch it, it's right there, since 1998. This movie has its own identity and it's good. Disney didn't ruin your childhood, your childhood it's with the animated film, not this one. I repeat, the animated movie it's right there. This is a new movie and we have to appreciate it for being new(as a film) and not to be a copy of something that we love(as a remake). Stop saying that this film it's bad just because don't have Mushu, the perfect Mushu
has been with us for years through the animated one. Now, try to see this movie as something totally different and new."
61,"This was supposed to be a classic and they just destroyed the story... You can't make a little dragon, but you can make a wich and dudes running on walls? What about using a Phoenix!? It's a mith from Greek mythology isn't it!? The Fenghuang is from the Chinese mythology. And although sad, the women were not given any opportunities. That was perfectly described in the animation... Why change it so much!? Just sad..."
62,"I tried to go into this with an open mind but the fact is, it's just not good. Some nice scenery, but the world building was just not there. It tries to distance itself from the animated film which is fine, even good... but in its place is a lack of character development or depth. If you're not going to cultivate a new worthwhile narrative than you need to replicate the story or the original, this does neither. It's like they couldn't decide which to do.
The biggest problem with this film though was just that the payoff was so lacklustre. Seemingly small scaled and uneventful, I can't remember watching a 2 hour movie before where every single person in the room was like 'was that it?' when the credits rolled.
Maybe this movie is just meant for kids, maybe my view is irrelevant. But for me, this movie joins the rest of the Disney remakes I've seen as soulless corporate filmmaking that adds absolutely nothing to culture. A movie that won't be talked about every again. There are better ways to spend $30, and there are a lot better ways to spend 2 hours."
63,"I expected better but I'm honestly not sure why. The plot was changed significantly, and you can't even say it was done to make the film more like the original story than the cartoon was, plus with all the ethical issues that have come up surrounding this, you're better off just watching the original."
64,"Some of the storyline and characters are replaced but being cringe af. Animal characters has become human, man seriously? Also battle scene is way more shorter and boring than I thought. I mean Mulan is kinda offend me since I'm being beyond excited and grateful as a Chinese to buy and watch the movie but the content is boring and disappointing. Could Disney remake Mulan again? And refund my money as well"
65,"I had been looking forward to seeing this remake for a long time only to be extremely disappointed.I was about 10 when the animated Mulan came out and had high hope's for the live-action.It really didn't feel like a Disney movie without the musical numbers, and original characters and storyline. I almost didn't finish the movie because it was so boring and confusing.NOT worth the $30!"
66,"Everything that was amazing from the cartoon was removed, the music, romance, women empowerment, and Mushu!
Instead we were given bland and emotionless acting, surrounded by a overly confusing plot with useless characters thrown in for.... reasons
The romance was so forced and cringe filled, all the intelligence from the first film was removed, and replaced with... just things happening.
The action scenes were bad.... so bad.
Now I'm off to watch something worth my time like the Original Mulan."
67,"-No MUSIC
-No Mushu
-No cricket
Why is there witches?
How is this even called Mulan."
68,"The director will try to justify how she has carefully re created the film interpreting in fact the original story of mulan not the Disney animated original.
Yet it falls flat all over. There is no character development. And at no point do we really develop a connection to those around her or really even what their names are. She just
Does what she does without any struggle, because brains aren't a requirement for mulan in this film, she's born with chi apparently. The ability to defy physics , arrows , swords
All with her inherit superpowers. If the film did not contain mulan in its title I guarantee this would've been straight to DVD regardless of coronavirus"
69,Not sure what was Disney thinking while creating such a trash. Watch the 1998 movie again if you want to watch Mulan. That's like 100 times better.
70,Every frame is beautiful. The story is ok. The fighting was ok. They could have hired an action director from Hong Kong to make the actions better.
71,"Completely superficial wanna be crouching tiger hidden dragon, emotionally distant movie. It's very hard to articulate as to why. Something about the acting seems like they're not fully invested, almost like you know they're simply in front of a green screen for hours on end whilst filming, with very little actual acting, behind dialogue, being done. It's not horrible, at this point Disney production value and budget are so high, it's next to impossible to make something than isn't At the very least enjoyable to look at for a couple hours. I would skip It and show the kids, House of Flying Daggers, I did. It wasn't even close which they enjoyed more."
72,"I've just seem this movie. I've also seen the 2009 version and obviosuly the animation as well.Of course it's hard when you try to bring animations to real life characters, it's easy to put soul and emotions in animations because it's being done my computers, perfect face movements, easy to project any emotion, from none to max with one click.Sure this movie is not a perfect replica and if it was people would say that it's exactly like the animation, nothing new was added , why would i rewatch something exactly same...blablablaAs a standalone movie, disregarding any other versions, this movie is actually pretty good.
Amazing cast, awesome environments, this is an easy 7.
What i got from it is what i got from the original, a woman going against everyone, against tradition and whatever weird stuff imperfect human kind concocted through the ages.Go see it and enjoy it, people have been without blockbuster movies for some time now thanks to Covid and now slowly we get some action here and there and they complain.Criticisim is good but not when it's over the top and ridiculous, who gives 1 and 2 stars? Let's be resonable here folks."
73,"For anyone who has not seen this film without serious thought, please watch it in from a standpoint of a father. It's more about love of a child than anything else. I personally am not a fan of movies such as this (Disney). Kids of all ages will love it.For the ""negative"" reviews, I will be (as a parent) a positive and a realistic critic of this movie.
It's beautiful.Be calm, truthful and safe during this pandemic."
74,"I didn't expect a copy of the animated film, I think it would be interesting if they took a different path to tell the story in a realistic way. The idea of removing Mushu, the ancestors, the cricket and the musical scenes was good, because it worked perfectly on an animated film but in a live action it wouldn't... but then they contradicted themselves by inserting some fantasy elements that just felt ridiculous. You can't connect with the story.I could point so many things that went terribly wrong, but I'll just mention two:1. They spent $200,000,000 on this film. $200,000,000! I recognize some elements of production design, photography and costume design were good. But come on, why did they made the combat scene at the snow mountain so lame? They had a $200,000,000 budget! I wonder where did they spend all that money because I don't really see it in the movie.2. The forced feminism. They want to show they care about this social issue but I don't understand why this vain effort in doing so. (I don't consider myself a feminist nor against feminism.)The original Mulan was already feminist. It showed how being a woman didn't stop Mulan from saving his family and, by consequence, her country. She was an ordinary woman that wanted to honor her family by following their traditions and getting married as they wanted, but when they ask his father to join the army she knows he is too old for that and is surely going to die on war. So she, for no other reason but love for her family and a wish to honor them despite failing in being a good woman, decides to sacrifice herself and go to war instead of her father. We see how she commits in being a good soldier, fails many times and yet she doesn't give up until she succeeds. They discover she is a woman because in the combat scene at the snow mountain she gets hurt while risking her life to save everyone and when they cure her they discover the truth. Even after they reject her, she insist and follows them to protect the emperor, they follow her because she becomes a leader and wether they accept her or not, she is still going to risk her life doing everything she can to save the emperor. She knows her limitations, she is not strong and because of that she uses her intelligence instead.
In this film the message is clear: It doesn't matter who you are, you can achieve anything if you trust yourself and work very hard for it.But on this new film, well... she is special, she has the power of ""Chi"". She doesn't even bother in being better. Why would she? She is so powerful and special just because the script says so. There is no development. She never does anything to win her comrades trust and respect. She reveals herself being a woman because she has to stop hiding who she really is, she must show the whole world how special she is. They reject her, but next scene she is back and suddenly everyone are all like ""Oh Mulan, you are the one that must protect the emperor because we just realized how special you are."" ""I am captain of this army and have years of experience but it doesn't matter, I trust your Chi, so please, lead us and save the emperor, you are our only hope."" This is just lame and extremely forced.
In this film the message is also clear: You can do anything but only if you are ""special"", otherwise don't even bother trying."
75,A three years old can write better dialogue than this garbage. The dialogue is cheesy and repetitive
76,"The acting, the screenplay, the direction, are all a misery. Unskilful, incompetent, unimaginative crew, creators and actors. A horrid disappointment. Not to mention the protagonist, while she is pretty on the outside, there is an unethical personality on the inside. Look away, don't waste your time on this, no matter how much you love (as I do) the original Disney's Mulan, there is nothing here to fill the nostalgia. In fact, watching this will make you feel much, much worse, wishing you'd never spoiled your fond memories with this awful remake."
77,My bank account... $35-$35 = $0. Cool story bro needed more dragons... literally where was Eddie Murphy.
78,"Terrible acting, ridiculous stunts throughout the movie. In the final fight scene, how can Jason Scott Lee's character not die after falling many stories, then he had perfect aim with the bow and shot the arrow right at the emperor many stories above while laying on the ground assuming hurt from the fall, then the emperor caught the arrow mid air like it was nothing, then Mulan somehow jumped in the air and kicked the arrow right back at Jason Scott Lee perfectly and killed him. RIDICULOUS MOVIE, HATED IT!!!!!!"
79,"This movie is very different to the animated film: there's no singing; there's no Mushu; there are lots of typical Chinese martial art action scenes (i.e. people running straight up walls/basically flying); there's a new villain; the ending is different.... And that's okay. Stories don't all have to be told in the same way. Sorry that you might be upset about that. Here is a review of the film from someone who isn't heartbroken that it's not identical to the animated movie. (Seems like I am one of the only people here who thinks that way.)IMO, live-action Disney adaptations that follow the animated version frame by frame are boring as hell because you know what's going to happen. At the end of the day, this movie is about a woman showing us she can do exactly what men can do - if not more - and she saves her kingdom through her persistence and intelligence, not just her physical strength. Is that not the message of the animated film? (She also brings the more ""feminine"" idea of love/family into what are considered prized virtues. Yay.)This rendition of Mulan naturally has a lot of power; but the crux is that she can only harness that by being true to herself as a woman, not by being deceptive and trying to pass as a man. So there's some weird chi-related stuff. You're not okay with that but you wanted a talking dragon? You can't have this woman accept herself and her strength unless Eddie Murphy helps her to do so?For people wondering about the witch: she represents what Mulan *could* have become based on the biases at the time. The witch is ""evil"" because she was cast out for being a strong woman and sided with the only people who would tolerate her. Mulan, luckily, gets to show her country her strength and be appreciated for it on the ""good"" side.Mulan's character isn't as fleshed-out as it could be; additionally, the story is weaker in parts and seems rushed in some sections (in particular when she is turned away by the general only to be accepted back minutes later and put at the head of the group to save the Emperor). However, it is a solid story of intelligence and perseverance and the action scenes are fantastic, which somewhat makes up for the lack of character development.Although it's not a musical, if you pay attention, some of the songs from the animated film do make their way into this edition. Also, some of the lines from the animated movie are repeated in this. (Mulan was my favourite ""Disney princess"" when I was a kid so I really noticed these nods to the older movie.)In short, this film has its flaws but I thoroughly enjoyed it as a new take on a classic. Stop being so butthurt it's not a carbon copy of something you already watched."
80,"Those who say this is worse than the ""original"", the ""original"" is Chinese folk lore. And I promise you the ""original"" folk lore didn't have funny looking talking Phoenix. All Disney live action get worse reviews than the cartoon version because they saw the cartoon version first. And this movie is also a victim of that.But as old as the ""original"" folk tale is there obviously are many versions. This live version certainly is different way of telling the famous story and I think it succeeded in doing so. They didn't try to turn it into a musical which I am soooo glad.It's not perfect, they tried to mix Chinese action and Disney which didn't seem to work. But the acting was good in general and certainly was entertaining."
81,Not sure why this has got such a low rating. I thought it was great. A real heart warming film. Great action scenes and most of all a happy ending.
82,I enjoyed this movie and didn't understand why it got low ratings. Perhaps people expected it exactly like the cartoon. A nice story and a nice character for women and children to look up to. Ignore the other reviews and just decide for yourself.
83,Boring and drawn out. Could not get into it... just terrible.... idk what all the fuse was about.
84,"The choice of Lau Yifei is a disgrace to this historic heroic story. Disney did a decent job in the original animation, but with this live character remake, Milan looks like another Disney princess. Poor storytelling by the main actress. It is surprisingly unconvincing she could have been a heroic figure. This Milan remake makes it to the list as one is the most disappointing movie ever done by Disney, and for sure the movie to skip for the year."
85,"SYNOPSIS:
Mulan (Yifei Liu) disguises herself as a man so she can fight in a war that her father is too old to.REVIEW:
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MULAN WHYYYYYYYYYYYY????*clears throat*Okay. Let me explain. I absolutely love the Mulan animated film. One of my all time favorites. I knew going into this film that they were making some ridiculous changes like taking out the songs and taking out Mushu and adding a new villain in the shape-shifting Xianniang (Li Gong) and I was still completely on board when I saw the trailer. This was my most anticipated film of the year so let me now go ahead and explain why this film left such an incredibly bad taste in my mouth. I'll break this one down into sections.DIRECTING/EDITING/SPECIAL FX:
First of all, the directing and editing/special effects were all so poorly done. For example, there's a scene near the beginning of the film when the invaders (this films version of the Huns and can't remember their name even. Something with an ""R"") are attacking one of the battalions and Xianniang uses a rug to reel this one guard in and there's about 7-8 jump cuts of her just reeling him in. I almost got nauseous from all of the unnecessary cuts just to make a shot look quicker when I'm reality one or two cuts at most would've served that shot much better. Then we had some shots where the camera turned sideways and then back upright and although I think a shot like that could've been amazing, the way it was used was almost just like an experiment. It could've been used far more efficiently. In any of the moments where the characters were going airborne, it felt very messy. I could notice imbalance as if they were stuck to rope, which they are, but is something that shouldn't be noticeable. Not giving any spoilers, but there's literally a scene where a large group of the invaders are on a hill catapulting fireballs at the imperial army and Mulan looks at them from below and in the very next scene is all of a sudden behind them... the only way she could logically done that without being scene is taking a week long trip around this giant hill which by that time would be too late for the other soldiers. Mind-boggling. I can then go on with how ridiculous some of the moves looked to a point where I held in laughter for the sake of the others watching the film with me and didn't want to be rude, but I'd be spoiling the film. Oh and the slow motion shots. My dear lord and savior the amount of slow motion shots in this film. It's truly something to see.STORY:
This part isn't something that I think people would necessarily agree or disagree with me on, but it's just my own opinion. I'm not a fan of how Mulan was already an established warrior. I understand that what they were going for is saying that this ""Chi"" that's within Mulan, is within every woman and it's up to them to know it's okay to bring it out regardless of how anyone else feels about it. I agree with that sentiment, however, the original film shows that even though you may not know it, as a woman, there is a warrior within and that you should do everything in your power to bring it out and to show others that you are just as capable as any man to be the fiercest warrior. Both sentiments are good, but there's something about someone who has barriers in front of them and us as viewers watching them break through the barriers to triumph. When Mulan already has this powerful ""Chi"" it by default makes her have an edge on other soldiers and doesn't create much of a challenge. Yea Xianniang is her opposite, but that storyline was so obvious to predict and there were almost no fighting scenes between the two. And the one or two that were in the film didn't feel intense. Didn't feel like Milan's life was in danger at any point. We had multiple scenes that felt so rushed. Not a moment that I felt any emotion whatsoever. Like the scene where Mulan I think is sneaking up on her dad to see him attempt to hold a straight sword and seeing in his eyes the fear, but the honor he must uphold. It's very emotional in the animation and in this it's completely butchered and void of any emotion. Scenes like the matchmaker that are actually trying to taking something from the original are so disappointing to watch and to know this will be the Mulan for most new generation kids. Then I would love to go on a rant on how taking out the commander love interest isn't necessary (cause you could form feelings for a higher up who's actually a genuinely good person) and how taking out the songs is preposterous, because obviously the original film wasn't sexist at all, in fact it was showing that you don't have to be a man to be a warrior, but that's for a different day.ACTING:
The only performance I felt was slightly above average was Yoson An as Honghui. The only thing is he played a character that almost any person can play. Just be charming on screen. BOOM! Love interest... check. Everyone else, including Yifei Liu, were somewhere between average and just bad. Some was due to writing and a lot was due to just bad acting. I'm pretty sure no one there was comic relief. A couple moments were supposed to be comical and missed. I don't understand why they couldn't have actors to represent those 3 goofball soldiers from the original. I know they have Yao (Chen Tang), but none of them at all resemble the original. If there's no Mushu and no soldiers for comical relief do we really have Mulan? Could we have made a film outside of the Mulan property? I still would've seen it, but yes I know millions wouldn't have and that's unfortunate, but it's better than tarnishing a beloved property.This was already so long and I could write a 10-page essay on how disappointing this film was for me, between the poor directing, bad acting, corny SFX and so much more it's hard for me to even give it as high of a score I'm giving it. The only reason I'm giving it this score is due to the sole fact that I feel part of me is slightly comparing it to the original which I think is fair in ways like when they're literally taking specific scenes from the animation, but the other part of me knows it wasn't meant to be a shot for shot live-action remake. The only redeeming factors was the scenery, the horses and the score that was played at poor moments and was too soft to really feel much from. 2.0/10."
86,"It's a great movie, action throughout and a fun watch overall. I'm not sure what these other reviews are complaining about. The characters were good, story was good, cinematography was great, acting was great, fight sequences were fun. I think these other reviewers are just expecting the world and love being negative. I enjoyed it and hope they make a sequel down the road."
87,"Released straight to Disney+, Mulan is an action movie. Despite few stunning visuals, the movie failed to create any impact on our mind. The movie lacks soul. Even watching from a kid point-of-view, the movie is disappointing with evident lack of character development. Sometimes the film is rushed too much. Speaking about the action sequences, the fights are mediocre and the lead character Yifei Liu can be seen only jumping from one roof to another throughout the whole movie. Talking about the other characters, Donnie Yen (Commander Tung) is the only one who really connected with his role.Sic_final_verdict: Disappointed! Waste of time! Watch the animated version instead!
Sic_score: 3.1⭐/10"
88,"Not even close to Mulan, I have no idea what I just watched."
89,"Epic fail that cost a fortuneI can handle the overly dramatic acting if only the story was worth it and sadly it is not,
If this is the best Disney has to offer then they won't go far in the streaming world!I am just praying as a big Marvel fan they don't screw up any future releases from them"
90,"A mediocre film, I don't recommend it. There are plenty of other films to choose from."
91,"It is ridiculous what Disney does, it takes a good animation and turns it into something bad. This movie has no personality, all the changes they made in the story are bad. The direction is horrible and incompetent, the script is poor, the performances are nothing special. It is ridiculous to compare the original animation with this live action, the animation is original, fun, visually beautiful and with memorable characters while this remake is only mediocre."
92,"If you are going to remake an animated movie that everybody likes, you better be sure that what you are doing is going to hold up. This one is just pathetic. All of the woke and feminist hooey is overdone, heavy handed, and preachy. Not to mention that the men are universally stupid boors. It's all so predictable. And sad. Really, really, sad. What a missed opportunity by Disney."
93,"Slow boring, over zealous, poor cinematography, too much emphasis on the feminist part and not on the story, the characters felt shallow. Ended up being distracted and then falling asleep due to being bored! Thank goodness the cinemas are all closed to stop this type of feminist rot from being shown! Pity that these films still cant show a strong female and tell a decent story also without down playing strong male roles!!"
94,"It's Disney, back at it again with an unnecessary remake. Like previous ones, they don't translate well and seems much more duller than the animated one. Avoid this one, not because of the politics behind it but because it's just a terrible movie."
95,"I didn't care one way or another, but this is really a situation where they dropped the ball to make a movie which is more than that silly cartoon they made back in 1998.I was glad they got rid of the dragon, but then they throw a witch in there. Why couldn't they just make the movie based on the original poem?The whole idea is that a woman succeeds when they lead an army to defeat invaders. The women are supposed to be at home making babies and cooking, but Mulan goes out and fights to save her father, her family and her Emperor/Kingdom.Isn't that enough?The movie was flat, boring fight scenes, and while better than the silly cartoon, I found the direction and acting terrible. Every one seems like they are card board cut outs. They phoned in their scenes. The director was out to lunch.It could have been better, but they opted to make a Disney movie."
96,"Just no Disney spark to this movie at all, so disappointed. Was expecting so much from this and what with it being Disney didn't expect to be let down this badly."
97,"I couldnt imagine a worse remake, all the best parts of the original left out, zero singing, mushu is missing, this is a horrible childrens war movie so pathetic...if you LOVE the original dont waste ur time with this garbage"
98,"A very linear storyline with a lack of excitement, a very bland experience overall. The acting was also very poor."
99,"The animated Mulan movie is a billion times better, funnier, and just amazing. I get they wanted to make a realistic movie but this just plain and simple didn't work. The animated movie had heart and a message; the live action film had none of those. The musical numbers in Mulan were some of the best music out there; they could have at least had many of the songs in this film in instrumental form; but nope! Mulan in this film is Rey like in Star Wars; super powerful from the beginning. There's no training, no struggle, a character you could care less about. Pass on this movie and don't waste your money on this. Wait til it's free on the streaming site."
100,"This film lacks so many things. Cinematography is pretty but the story is so cartoonish and just flat out bland. Like brown rice bland. The editing is terrible, looks like they're trying to cut around bad choreography. Mulan starts off as this gifted girl with no story arc and her character is super stagnant. Acting is bad. Story doesn't make sense. Disney should just stop with the trashy remakes. They also got rid of mushu for that hawk lady!? Moral of the story is don't spend your money on this film. I wish I could take back the 1 hour and 55min of my time back and watched something better."
101,"Great movie.... keep an open mind..... Keep in mind you are not watching the animated movie from 1998 which was made with children in mind. The movie has a great storyline and can easily inspire young minds. ""You can be/do what ever you want to just as long as you do everything you can to get to your goals"""
102,"... because I would feel ripped off if I gave Disney any compensation for watching this.As for the story, it doesn't flow, almost every scene feels wasted. There were a bunch of references to the original Mulan, but none of the context as to what made those scenes relatable. The villains never feel threatening because we know Mulan has magical powers. The main villain is completely undeveloped and so was the witch. Mulan having a sister just wastes screen time. She brought absolutely nothing to the movie.The combat sequences are laughably bad for a big budget movie. They downplay the violence a lot, and it doesn't look like anyone that the witch fights gets hurt at all. You never feel threatened by the villains. In the original Mulan, the villains were dark, scary, and it put me on edge watching the characters interact with them.The acting seemed bad partially because of the way the story is structured and we never really get to know any of the side characters. Everything feels very wooden, and the dialogue doesn't help. Every conversation feels like a forced reference to the original movie but without any of the context. Even in the scenes that are almost a word for word reproduction of the first movie, the delivery is so off that the scenes take on a completely different meaning. Mulan's relationship with her father is completely different (which is fine) but it doesn't come across smoothly.As for Mulan, in this film she doesn't have to work to achieve anything. She just has these special powers and she either decides to unleash them or hide them. Thus it is hard to relate to her story or root for her.Rewatch the original Mulan. It has a similar runtime but there is so much more character development. The script is tight. Mushu and Cricket give us insight into what Mulan is thinking and how she's feeling. Without any characters like that, the movie doesn't work. She could have at least monologued to the phoenix emblem or a picture of her family or something.It scores 3 points solely because it's a visually stunning movie."
103,"The worst movie, I wanna sleep, never watch this movie again."
104,"We are so disappointed with this movie. The effects is so bad made that it is embarrassing. And all the good and funny points/affects in the classic Mulan movie they haven't added.
We gave it 4 stars as some of the new aspects and interpretation is a bit interesting and more modest, which is needed in this type of fantasy movie."

106,"You know they cut the dragon, cut the training part, and mulan have something like chakra in naruto."
107,"Whether you're comparing it to the original animated version, or reviewing it as a stand-alone movie: it's bad. Everything that made you love the original (the music, the quirky characters, the story) it's gone. The music I can understand. They wanted to preserve Chinese culture. But the characters that we loved? Gone. Replaced with shallow or new characters that add zero depth or purpose to the film. Why is there suddenly a witch? They removed iconic scenes like the hair cutting, the first glance at Shan Yu (who isn't called Shan Yu btw), and so many more amazing scenes. In my opinion this entire film just falls short. Very disappointing"
108,"Yes it's different from the original. Yes I missed the singing & really wanted to hear Mulan's voice. At the same time, the way this version was crafted it made sense the way they wrote it. I looooved it."
109,"A bad movie, from script to acting, has nothing to praise. This is a buggy version of Disney animation. Advise everyone not to watch because it was a waste of time, I couldn't be patient to watch it all to the end."
110,"Instead of watching a story about a young woman who overcomes challenges and grows into a strong warrior, we are presented with a character who has always been strong and just has to hide her abilities. They present Mulan as the ""chosen one"" and so everything pretty much falls in her favour. This film was not enjoyable to watch, I really wanted to like it but it's so inferior to the classic it's frustrating. I loved the classic, and I know the director said she wanted to make it more realistic by cutting out Mushu but she still includes mystical characters and flamboyant fight scenes (that were very unrealistic). Why cut out what made the classic so enjoyable? The film doesn't have the strong impact the classic has, they skim over important moments and Mulan barely grows throughout the film. While they try to present some good lessons, they gloss over all of these important moments and so you really don't feel anything during this movie except frustration. The villains aren't menacing and make the stupidest choices that favor the protaganist. The characters who you know are meant grow into close friends are all awkward and don't seem close at all. And somehow the film just drags on - it felt like forever to get through. I'm not saying it should have had musical numbers or Mushu, but they had the opportunity to present a great Chinese tale about female empowerment yet somehow created a boring film that lacks impact, creativity and strong direction."
111,"In terms of positives, I really love the cinematography. They really make china look beautiful. I also love the lead as Mulan. Liu Yifei does a pretty great job portraying Mulan. But I really felt that this film apart from those positives was just kinda soulless. It was much longer than the first, so the pacing was alot slower and boring at times. The original really had a nice blend with comedy and drama.The really expressive animation and catchy songs really elevated my enjoyment of that film. So watching this remake really made me love the original alot more. I think i recommend you watching the original film than this one if you want to have fun watching a Mulan film while also being engrossed in the gripping story."
112,"A movie night with her besties was what our daughter wanted for her 10th birthday. So we turned on the new Mulan, the perfect film for a group of girls between 10 and 13 years old.
I get that the reception of Mulan has been controversial. But don't listen to the misogynistic troll community of the internet that tries to mansplain, why ""this is not Mulan"", because it doesn't have an annoying talking dragon as comic relief. What needs to be taken more seriously, though, is the criticism of people directly from China or with cultural reference to the country. Despite all efforts, Disney apparently got a couple of things wrong. The inclusion of a phoenix as a religious symbol is among them. Accepted. Nowadays, it has become increasingly difficult to make a film that suits everyone. We need to be conscious of the misdepiction of non-western cultures and learn how to make it better. But Mulan gets many things right anyway.
First of all, Yifei Liu's Mulan is a great heroine with whom the young viewers could identify immediately. The new figure of the ""witch"" also worked well as a fascinating and ambivalent antagonist. Director Niki Caro uses the rather allegorical visual language of martial arts cinema to good effect. Naturalistic set pieces and landscape shots support her style of storytelling in a very good way (we know that she can do this since Whale Rider). Overall, this is an entirely new version of the Mulan story rather than a bland re-telling.
Personally, I think this is a better way to approach these remakes. The almost shot-by-shot remake of The Lion King, despite being tremendously successful, didn't work for me at all. This version of Mulan stands much more on its own feet. It's an epic, rousing and feminist action movie that should have gone to the cinemas, where it belongs. But it's worth watching at home, too."
113,"I don't understand the low reviews this movie is getting. I'm not sure why so many hate it. What are they comparing it to? The animation version? This movie follows the key storyline of the animation, but it is not a carbon copy. So don't expect it to be like the animation or you'll be disappointed. If I based my interest in this movie on the reviews alone, I would not have watched it. But thank goodness I did (watched it, that is).The movie is beautifully shot on location with grandiose panoramic shots, and authentic looking sets. The action can be engaging, and beautifully captured. Some unique action sequences, but for most part nothing you haven't seen from these genre of movies before. Like wire work action sequences but not overly done. Overall, it (the action) adds to the story telling of the movie, and not detracts from it.But for me the biggest plus of this movie is, it's not a musical. Thank goodness, they didn't turn this into a musical, like they did with Aladdin. This is an action based movie, where the animation's original musical score is played in the background at appropriate moments, instead of being front and centre.If looking for an action based movie with a feel good story, give this a go. It's a better movie that the current ratings (4.3 at the time this review was written) it's currently getting."
114,I came to this fresh. I haven't seen the original. I didn't know the story. Judged solely therfore on its own merits I really enjoyed this movie.
115,"The movie is made in China, you know the quality. Iin the end, why thanks xinjiang police"
116,"The whole family enjoyed it - kids, parents and grandparents. This is probably the closest version to the Chinese legend itself except that it adds more details and shortens the years of military service."
117,"Mulan - C+ (Flawed but Worthy)Another cash grab from Disney after The Lion King, stripped off any emotion, fun or remotely entertaining about the original Mulan. The visuals are stunning but full of CGI, you can even see green screen in some places. The action is very mediocre, you can feel it's heavily rehearsed and they are hanging by ropes.Disney's excuse for not adding Cricket and Mushu In the movie is to bring more realism to the story but have a woman turning into birds and other humans at the same time. The Game Of Thrones Daenerys Dragon wings moment with Phoenix was really cringeworthy.People will remember Aladdin because of Will Smith, Beauty and Beast because of Emma Watson and Cinderella because Lily James and Cat Blanchett but sadly Mulan has no rememberable quality except that you paid $30 bucks on top of already monthly paid subscription."
118,This was a solid movie with enough action to keep you entertained throughout. I missed some elements from the Disney classic but found this movie to stand up in its own two feet. There were a few nice nods to the original. If you just want a live action remake of the 98 animated then you might be disappointed. This is its own movie and should be treated as such. Where Disney failed with Aladdin they succeeded with Mulan.
119,"Was planning to watch with my family for long, but finally it disappointed us, esp my daughters, not worth the money to watch"
120,"As a 71 year old Caucasian male I really enjoyed Mulan 2020. Of course as a Disney film you would expect flaws, but this time the writers and the director used considerable restraint so as not to make it too ""Disneyfied"", as they tend to do all too often. An inspirational story-line for younger girls, was enhanced by, fantastic visuals and an interesting and at times informative historical backdrop, that helped those ignorant of ancient China, to visualize an imagined time and place different from their own. Also you can't be too picky about historical detailing when this movie tends to also pick up on some of the old Japanese movies of earlier times I remember watching. Although very different, Akira Kurosawa movie ""The Seven Samurai"", there were a number of attributes that were certainly taken from other early Japanese movies, such as farcical characters, magicians, witches and sword fighters that climbed up vertical walls, the list goes on. Also we should not forget that this is first a fairy tale for kids, so we should not expect absolute historical accuracy. Mulan 2020 is meant to entertain in an acceptable package aimed at kids, especially young girls. It's fictional entertainment first and foremost, after all. I also think the overly precious critics who panned Mulan 2020 for not being true to the animated version or thought it should be like a documentary on ancient China, should grow up and smell the fairy floss. Mulan 2020 is nothing like Mulan 1998 - and was never meant to be - and for that I for one am eternally grateful. I am sick of police shows, serial killers and most American comedies, so for me this movie was a pleasant change and very watchable, I give it a 9, I really enjoyed it. So there."
121,"Such a great movies. I dont know why people hate this movies. this movie not really worst. And this movie also has a pretty good storyline, meaningful and warm movie colors make it a comfortable movie to watch"
122,"The original Disney Mulan movie was about a young inexperienced girl, and by sheer will, grit and courage, she learned how to be an exceptional soldier and leader to defeat a formidable enemy, along with the other soldiers she inspired.This new Mulan movie is none of that. It is about a girl with superpowers who beat up an inferior enemy because she had superpowers. Therefore this movie is a failure, because it fails to teach its most important lesson: any person, male or female, can succeed against all odds through team-work, bravery, good training and a will to succeed.I did find this movie entertaining, but felt sad that the writers and director just didn't get what Mulan was about."
123,"People criticise the movie saying that it was made for China, I mean?? The movie is good live action interpretation of the story of Mulan, updates the visuals (effects) of the story, the movie is exactly as it should be without being repetitive when compared to the original animation I don't get the excessive criticism and the low rating. People implying that Eddie Murphy injected into Chinese fairy tale would give it more authenticity, I mean just listen to what you are saying. In fact, in light of the recent controversies steming inaccuracies in portraying other cultures and Hollywood appropriating characters I feel this movie does right by these issues and therefore authentically represents Mulan the legendary Chinese warrior Hua Mulan from the poem the Ballad of Mulan, and that is the criticism I have trouble with."
124,"So cheeeesy! When I was a kid everything Disney put out was in level of art but what they put out these days is just something to kill time with. This movie version of Mulan has great shooting set, computer graphics, casting, and acting but all goes down due to not the failure of individuals but the incompatibility of the script - Its foundation. At the beginning the movie goes all fine. Your awe and expectations grow and grow and then starting from the middle, it becomes sooo cheesy! Level of cliche reaches the roof! Is Disney underestimating our young generation? Do they not know they are used to exploding buildings and dead hit gun-fires? Oh, yes, sure, the last scene was moving. But that one redeeming quality can only do so much. Who in the right mind can be okay with that horrible time pause they portrayed in the war scene?
My stomach feels so greasy, I need to go to the market and buy a gallon of 100% condensed vegetable drink. Why don't I run, time it well, jump off to lower ground, get on a running horse just like that and bust my prostate."
125,"Disney has been struggling with their live adaptations, with some that is almost frame by frame reiterations of the animation (cough Lion King cough) or some that changes the plot so much that it is unrecognisable (Dumbo). Mulan offers a good balance between calling back to its roots and giving a fresh take on the story. The action sequences are also top notch."
126,Disney has been telling everyone for over a year that this film is not based on the animated version of the 90s. Stop comparing it to that. It's no wonder why they didn't want to release it in theaters because of all the cry babies expecting Mushu and singing. Totally getting an unfair review by about 90 percent of the people on here and that's too bad.
127,"First of all, I agree with the other critiques saying that this version of Mulan has few if any similarities with the original animations. However, I don't really mind it as much and went in to this expecting Mulan (2020) to be its' own thing with no connection to the animation.The scenery, the animations and the choreography are all fantastic. You have colorful environments filled with unique architecture, clothing and people that create a vagrant living world. The battles are well rehearsed with the camera team capturing all the juicy overpowered fightingmoves.However, what killed the joy of this movie for me was the story. It's filled with plotholes. Every single struggle, every single obstacle is avoided or handled with deus ex machinima. Meaning that in every scenario there's a lucky occurrence that somehow creates the PERFECT scenario for Mulan to easily do whatever is necessary. To use an example that's not in the movie and doesn't spoil the storyline: If Mulan would've had to assassinate an enemy commander in a camp filled with hundreds of elite soldiers, trained from childhood. Then the level of plotholes in this movie would be equivalent of all those elite soldiers being unable to see Mulan walking past them, waving her hands above her head, because she's a head shorter than the soldiers."
128,Had a good time watching Mulan. I've never been a follower of any other type of Mulan series so it didn't contaminate this movie for me and I saw this as a wholy entertaining saga.
129,"Lead actress is not look like Mulan
And too expensive"
130,The movie is totally forgetable. I miss the good songs and voices in the original Mulan. Liu's performance was as stiff as the background which was a joke. I thought I was watching a broadway show. The plot's pacing was also patchy. There were some ok fighting scenes but lasted way too long. Damn! I want my money back
131,"I believe in Hua Mulan and so should you, since it's the empowerment of women that will maximise the potential of this world - even if they have to do it without help while surrounded by prejudice, bigotry and misogyny. A truly great and inspirational story that those alluded to would rubbish because of their lack of courage."
132,"Poor acting, The actress playing Mulan clearly has no martial arts training period to the movie, she is a terrible actor... Just watch the original again... This was as mad as the lion King remake"
133,"This film has every element that would had turned it into a really great film. The casts are good, the cinematography is beautiful, and the story of Mulan itself is beautiful. However, it didn't turn out as good as it should have.The problem here, I believe, lies in the way the filmmakers directed the film. The drama part in the beginning of the film could definitely had been better. In the animated version, I always end up really emotional, but this one didn't make me felt sorry for Mulan as much as I should have. I know it's Disney, so I shouldn't expected it, but I think the film would had been a success if they had decided to make the film a full-blown action drama film. It would have opened many new opportunities for Disney.Moreover, sometimes I felt like I was watching one scene and then it suddenly skipped to the other scene. The film is a bit too fast-paced. The filmmakers could had given a little more time to develop its characters, so viewers could feel for them.As for the casts, I think they casted the right people, but somehow, everyone seem so emotionless in the film. It was a waste of talent. As for the lead, Liu Yifei was great as Mulan. I don't care about her political view, but as an actress, I think she is fitted for the role. As Mulan, she is stunningly beautiful and fights like a warrior.Overall, the film is not bad, but it's not great either. A new team of screenwriter would improve the film a lot."
134,"My expectation is too high, but it's still worth to watch for me. I have watched it two times and I like it, maybe I like it cause I really exited and my expectationWithout mushu this movie is incomplete and there are no songs in this movie, which makes it feel flat"
135,I'm speechless! Horrible movie. Not worth $30. Too bad I can't get my money back. Worse mistake ever
136,"Mulan is a dull thud of a live action remake that strips away a lot of subtext that the animated version had. All done so Disney could appease the Chinese censors.Mulan (Liu Yifei) is the daughter of an old soldier. Ever since she was a child, she had combat skills. Now instead of being married off. Mulan dresses as a boy and goes to fight in her father's place as the Emperor is being threatened by rebel Böri Khan.Mulan at first trains with her unit, they are a varied bunch of misfits. She smells as she is reluctant to bath with the others as it will give her identity away.It is colourful and there are some good battle sequences. It is also too bland and serious. Only the scenes with Xianniang. A warrior with witch like powers who is aiding Khan does the film hint at some homo eoticism as well as debating the role of women in the military.It is a very choppy and stiff story. Mulan goes from being an outcast when she reveals her sex to suddenly leading the army unit to defend the Emperor. At times it looked like I was watching Kung Fu Panda without the fun."
137,"I thought the movie was ok but what really destroyed me and gave it a 1 star rating was that there was no Mushu, Cricket as a cricket, and the three guys dressed up as a girl scene. There was a lack of songs as well. One good part though was the original voice of Mulan at the end but not actually Mulan's voice."
138,"Whilst I like the original animated Mulan from 1998, I don't have a huge attachment to it. I only watched it for the first time a couple of years ago, and I really enjoyed it but not quite on the level that a lot of people seem to.That's why I have a feeling I'll be in the minority when I say that I actually preferred the live action remake of Mulan over the original. There aren't any songs, and Mushu isn't in the film, but that didn't bother me in the slightest. In fact, considering the tone and the atmosphere that they went with, I'm glad they weren't in the film.The best part about this version of Mulan is the cinematography. It's a visually stunning film, with beautiful colours and gorgeous scenery. Almost every shot was framed in such a way that would make it a really nice poster, and that's rare for a film nowadays.The narrative was constantly compelling and I loved the gritty samurai elements. The action was well choreographed, if a little choppy at times. Another major pro was the musical score, as it added so much drama to scenes which were already exciting.The screenplay was brilliantly written for the most part, but my main criticisms with the film lies within the minimal development for the villain and the little training that we saW Mulan go through. There were also some scenes that I felt could have been shortened, allowing room for the plot elements that I just mentioned.Overall, whilst it's clear from the reviews that a lot of audience members are not happy with this iteration of Mulan, I had a thoroughly good time with it and I can see myself rewatching this film instead the original which isn't something I say very often. If you're asking me, this is a strong recommendation.SCORE: 86%"
139,"Why Disney have to use Liu Yifei? her performance is bad, and her real life character doesn't match the character of the story. It may work better if she swap her role with Gong Li."
140,"This production alone is worth more than the current IMBd 5/10. I for one, really enjoyed it. Excellent writing and directing. Stunning cinematography, visuals and S/VFX. The score was on point, and casting and performances all great. For a Disney film, the action was awesome. My only critique is the pacing made the 115 min runtime feel much longer. Some scenes were too long and dragged out. Still, very enjoyable and certainly undeserving of its current low score. It's an 8/10 from me"
141,This is trash. I can't even be bothered with this review! This movie is boring and looks cheap! Acting was bad story bad! Disney wrecking another loved movie!
142,"This movie was such a cool movie. It uplifts you and give you hope. Ï kept saying ''Yay, you go girl'' in various scenes in this movie. Such a cool movie. This movie sends a message to all woman out there. You can do it! You are amazing and strong!
Yifei Liu played her part amazingly. This role fit her perfectly. I didn't know that Jet Li had a part in this movie. But that is so cool that Jet Li was in this movie.
This movie is motivational. Similar to how that animated movie ''Brave'' is.
It is an inspirational movie and uplifting.
A movie for everyone."
143,I have just seen the worst movie ever. The have changed the whole story.
144,"Mulan is the best remake of Disney, it is a stunning and spectacular film, of course in my opinion it could still be better if there were some things from the original that I expected in this film, but overall the film is very good and Yifei Liu as a mulan is Perfect !!!"
145,I watch Mulan as a kid and I was expecting this movie to failed me terribly due to bad reviews.I really liked the movie and I believe it stayed true to the old cartoon movie.Great work and acting!!
146,Another unnecessary live-action remake of an original animated Disney film.Comparatively this lacks the charm and fun of the original. It tries to be everything for everyone in an attempt to make the more palatable for families. I found the editing a little jarring as they are many a jump cut that does nothing for the continuity and flow of this film.I found this more Mudane than Mulan.
147,"I am just from watching this and I actually really loved this movie and it brought a lump on my throat. I don't know what issue people reviewing this lowly have with the story.It's a very touching story about a young lady that challenges convention and follows her heart at great cost to her life and well-being to be what she was born to be, a warrior!This movie speaks to everyone of us about choosing to follow your heart rather than what society dictates you to be.Watch it and thank me later!"
148,So dissapointing.... just... dissapointing. There is nothing good about this movie
149,"As I go through the user reviews here, it's obvious that many are disappointed that it's not like the animated film from the 90s - it still needs to be said that it was a good choice of the filmmakers to do something new instead of a scene-by-scene remake like The Lion King (2019). So let's see the film for what it is and not what people wanted it to be.Going through the cast alone, it's obvious that this film gathered a lot of amazing actors. Yifei Liu, Donnie Yen, Jet Li, Li Gong, Pei-Pei Cheng. These are some really big names in the Chinese cinema. We also have the two writers behind the new Planet of the Apes trilogy that came out during the 2010s, plus two other screenwriters that don't have any known credits before this film. And then there's the director, Niki Caro, known for emotional dramas based on real events. Oh, and all of this is produced by Disney.Disney is such a difficult word, because usually when something gets done by Disney, it's almost certain that it will be a big hit or at least seen by a lot more than if a smaller studio did it. But then again, if you think of any famous director and then put their names together with Disney, it still ends up more like a Disney film than a film by that director alone, it's like their soul is slowly ripped away from the films by Disney and I feel it's the same with Mulan.It made a lot of sense when the news was announced that Niki was hired as an director and that they were going to make the film more realistic, no songs, no magical creatures, closer to reality - that sounds like something that would fit with Niki's other films and it would also be Disney's most mature film about a girl becoming a man, becoming a warrior, becoming a woman. But then something must've happened. There's a witch that can turn into a bird and Mulan got a strong ""chi"" that works like the force. I have a hard time believing that this is what Niki had in mind when she wanted to make this film more realistic, then good for her, but to me it ends up becoming the opposite.Others have already pointed out that there was never any worry that Mulan was in any real danger, because she was so strong to begin with, having strong chi, she started off great and never developed, unless you call that scene where she takes off her armor as development. I have a hard time seeing how young girls (and boys) can see themselves in someone like this Mulan when she's already so strong and special, instead of having her starting off as nobody and becoming that special someone. If anything it only alienates people instead of giving them hope.Sadly this is yet another disappointment among the many other Disney live-action films, with Niki Caro now joining the group of famous directors like Tim Burton, Kenneth Branagh, Jon Favreau, Marc Forster and Guy Ritchie with much better films outside of Disney's claws.And seriously! What is up with Jet Li's voice, why did they have to dub him? At least try to find a voice that's close to what he would sounds like, this was just distracting when he suddenly had such a deep, grumbly voice."
150,"It's not even the same story. Mulan is a completely different character. She is a special girl with a special unique Chi which grants her the ability to fight like a man. Not the same clumsy girl who works hard to fight for her family honor.There's also no comic element, nor sense of timing. Mulan can somehow travel 1 mile on horseback and prepare on the snow capped mountains in literally 2 seconds. And that's no joke, which this movie doesn't have either. Has no jokes."
151,"I didn't had high hopes for this movie, but I wanted to give it a chance. It seems like the makers wanted to adapt the story of the animated version, but with their own ideas. I can admire that they are trying not to make an exact copy, but it could have been so much better.The pacing is often way too fast to establish the characters, emotions and scenery. This results in a movie without feeling and dept.
What I disliked the most was the fact that Mulan had some kind of super power... not very realistic. I often thought: ""yeah sure... another impossible move""
Also the added characters were very dull. The witch was not a very strong character, very vague. The sister has no character at all.
All the beloved scenes from the animated Mulan were changed, so it could be more realistic, but it was terrible.
The humor was not funny at all.The only things I did like were the amazing environments. It was often very beautiful.
I almost also liked the fact that they added the phoenix instead of the dragon... untill the phoenix appeared... I thought about Harry Potter, how much more that creature has added to the movie. In this movie it was no adding at all...I would not recommend to watch this movie."
152,The female lead really needs to brush up her acting. She made the movie feel so amateur.
153,"If you are stuck on this movie not copying the original then consider this. Do women have value? Yes. Are women strong? Yes. Do women deserve equal treatment? Yes.While the original may hold a special place for many of us, the themes and messages couldn't be more outdated. This movie didn't go so far fetched like the Sleeping Beauty, it still follows the same story but with updated themes that's more familiar to people today.This movie was a beautiful retelling of the story. While it may not follow some of the original scenes and characters, it has its own magic of its own and has earned its rightful place as a Disney classic.As a father of a daughter Milan's representation is everything that is right about this movie. Go in without expectations and experience this movie for what it truly is. Courage, brave, and true."
154,"I noticed she ""Don't Need No Man"" to save the EmpireXDBut I only realized after watching the IGN review chi=force, ""this mythical force also undermines Mulan's position as hero who succeeds based on courage, determination and natural ability as she did in the original. That unfortunately turns what was an inspiring underdog story into a kind of superhero origin tale""Disney made her Rey!"
155,I could see what Disney was trying to do but too rushed and the whole witch thing kinda drew away from the actual point of Mulan.
156,"I cannot believe how horrible this movie is. What a waste of money. The graphics are a joke, the storyline is a joke, it's just so boring. WAIT TIL IT'S FREE!"
157,"I don't get it, the source material was there, the money was there but this movie is just plain bad. Don't waste your money and time in it!"
158,The animation original was so good. This version has no understanding of the Chinese culture or historical accuracy. It makes no sense.Horrible ending. Horrible story. Horrible director. Just screwed up.
159,Very tedious and dull. Little to no character development. I didn't care for any character at all. The action sequences were lame and cringey. Don't waste your time. Literally 2 hours of my life wasted.
160,"It's so beautiful! It's wonderful! This is a great movie. I never liked Disney's live-action movies, but this time I was really touched. Mulan's quality of never giving up moved me. I recommend everyone to watch it."
161,"It's like they took the Milan movie, removed any humor, character development and continuance of a story line... if you hadn't seen the first Milan the movie would make even less sense. Don't waste your time or money. I would have thought Disney would have learned after the disaster Aladdin was .... :("
162,"I usually don't write reviews, but all these negative reviews based on US vs. China patriotism are a disgrace.
If you can watch a movie without searching for political messages you should be able to enjoy this one. All in all it's well done with some minor flaws. It's entertaining, inspiring, definitely not as funny as the original, but equally touching. Give it a chance"
163,"I was super excited for this movie to come out as i wanted to see the mulan i loved as a real person, and what did i get? Poor acting, a whole different story, zero emotions, and the part i was looking forward to the most the songs! NOT THERE! Do you know how iconic the original songs were? How could you not include them? Half an hour in and i couldnt even finish it... so dissapointed"
164,"I was looking forward to this movie the trasiler looked good alas the movie was a let down, it was bland and kind of boring...I expected much more.Honestly not worth the price of admission. :("
165,Everything I loved about mulan was taken from me.Not sure if it's a spoiler but mulan is basically Rey skywalker.
166,"What a disappointment. No heart, bad acting, each scene seemed dull and the acting was poor. Way too long.
The original animated Mulan would be so disappointment at her real life representation."
167,"First thing's first - don't expect for this film to be remotely close to the Mulan you remembered in 1998. Don't expect for this to be nostalgic and also don't expect to be singing along to songs in your living room with the $30 you paid for.Cons
Here's a few things
There's no Mushu, there's no Shang, no grandma, no cricketThere's poor character development and depthThe iconic scenes on Mulan's transition was poorly developed.The scenes were very rushed and we barely got the chance to watch the scenes that were iconic to the storylineIt was fluffy. Very very fluffyThere was a neverending use of ""disgrace"" and ""dishonour"" yes we get it but if we wanted to play word bingo, Disney could've added a $2.50 print-at-home templateSomewhat pros
Don't get me wrong, what I enjoy about this film was the creative spin to the storyline - but boy oh boy did they go on a creative spin alright. So creative you're probably scratching your head wondering if this was an adaption of the Mulan in 1998 or another film adopting the name instead. But anyway, on a positive note, the acting was actually great and I wouldn't fault that. The special effects was pretty good and enjoyable to watch so kudos to the cast and special effects team."
168,"I watched this movie and i skipped it a lot, couldn't force myself to finish this movie. i don't know but the movie was so boring and plain. they took nostalgia things from the cartoon so it made mulan live action just nothing special inside the movie. bad acting, no excitement, and boring dialogue."
169,"The movie is horrible!!1. No Mushu!!
2. Horrible acting
3. No Shang!Don't waste money on this garbage!"
170,"I really wanted this movie to be good since I hated the other Disney remakes, but this is by far the most boring and generic plot of all of them. Not exciting or fun in anyway. Bland, bland, bland. Stay away and save your money."
171,I guess it's relevant that i never made it through the animation versions so am just judging this as it is. We likely needed this more than lion king but it should also Not be judged Against expectations
172,"As a princess movie, a story that will soon be well-known all over the world. To be creative and profound, it is difficult to be honest, but I am very satisfied with the growth and awakening of Mulan in the movie. What's even more rare is that this movie is focused on female martial arts. It's smooth, beautiful and powerful. In terms of literary drama, Mulan's and father's emotions poke me, and the screen is as usual as Disney's dream, but it's not the same. The difference before is that the scenery brought by the live shooting is real, which is great! The actors' performances are also very clever and detailed."
173,"I am writing this review after watching the movie and an episode of Screen Rant's Pitch Meeting for the movie😂 .Pitch meeting is right. Disney has actually managed to remove all the fun out of the original to probably make a social commentary I guess regarding women empowerment (Like in Aladin Live action, which is as bad) but end up falling well short of its intentions and being a complete joke.I was trying desperately to write something good about the movie , but No. This is a bad movie."
174,"Pretty casting but lack of character development, colorful scenes but poor choreograph and screenwriting leaving awkward moment for some scenes. 2 hours of movie, nothing surprising as each moment is predictable and ""knew what its going to be"" with the animated version, still strongly prefer the animated version."
175,"I have a wife of Asian decent so both my kids loved the original Mulan. My daughter especially loved Mulan and has grown up to be just as fierce. This is not the cartoon, this is better. The visuals and the casting were perfect. This by far the best adaptation ever done from cartoon to live action of all time. If you are looking for a movie full of songs and jokes then watch the cartoon. If you are looking for something that will bring real honest emotion and pride then watch this one. This will go on my all time favorites list."
176,"I actually really enjoyed this movie. Stunning visuals, good acting and beautiful scenery. It's different from the animation but I like that. I don't want to see the same exact story like they did with The Lion King."
177,"It's not the musical, but essentially the same story. The score and cinematography are amazing. You'll feel transported and immersed in her world.
Removing the songs might be what Disney needed this whole time. There are hints throughout in dialog and the music, so they didn't scrap it completely. The soundtrack has three versions of Reflection in English, Japanese and Mandarin."
178,"I'll tell you what it is: one of the worst Disney movies ever. And that could pretty much seal it.
This ""2020 style"" re-enactment of 1998 ""Mulan"" is really obnoxious, unbearable, to the point of being unwatchable. A true mess. Another useless and unasked for ""live action remake"" of an animated classic. In short: another bump. And something more: one of the worst bumps out there (and you gotta bear in mind that competition is hardcore on that regard...).If you'll ever have the guts to watch this, I guarantee you'll keep asking yourself over and over again ""Why am I still sitting here? Why am I still watching this stuff?"" So quickly it becomes an exercise in pure masochism. An act of total abnegation. Bearing through this movie should be considered an heroic enterprise. And that because ""Mulan"" is complete garbage (I know, I know, I'm getting a little repetitive here, excuse me very much).Lemme briefly tell you why. First and foremost I'd like to start by generally stating that the writers and the producers managed to strike out pretty much everything that worked in the animated classic and for reasons unbeknownst to the most of us replace it with... roll the drums... nothing. Absolutely nothing worth noticing or tuning in for. I mean, Mushu, the comic relief, the feminist undertones, the all-around amusement... all that stuff... gone, just like that.
So we are ""gifted"" (for a competitive 29.99$ sum) with a ""brand new movie"" made out of:Zero suspense and zero emotions. And that's pretty much self-explanatory, isn't it? In a nutshell: this is a hollow movie. Compared to which even Warhol's massive 8-hours-long ""Empire"" proves itself to be one of the most intoxicating and exhilarating movie experiences ever;Awful dialogues and screenplay. The reasons why the movie gets ridiculous and unbearable fast, really really fast;""Curious"" editing choices. Take - for example - the avalanche scene. Well, there you have it: a cut right in the middle of the action. In the next frame, Mulan has already magically ""teleported"" herself behind the enemy lines, has already placed a line of helmets like Flash-speed style and is already on the verge of shooting the arrow... Whoah, people! The things you can do with that ""qi""...;Bad directing. Just look at the action scenes. In those scenes the makers are clearly desperately trying to imitate wuxapians and Hong Kong action movies' choreography, and - guess what? - they fail miserably. Five seconds of let's say ""House of Flying Daggers"" are radically better that this entire wannabe epic Disney fare;Cringy rhetoric. We keep being fed all the usual ""family, honor, homeland, true men"" rhetoric. And that's rich for a movie ostensibly ""feminist"". It's like some kind of a reverse cautionary tale that's basically saying to us: you must always serve and revere your family and your country, no matter what, no matter the cost, no matter your own ideals and dreams, no matter if they constantly try to subdue you and harness you. Wow.That ""qi"". Thanks to which Mulan becomes some sort of a 6th century Wonder Woman. That means: no more struggle, no more hardships, no more fatigue under the training process. She's already all-powerful. She's already unbeatable. She's already a superhero. (Of course they did that for the realism. Out of respect for a millennial culture, it's obvious.)Were it all not enough, there's a final issue. Of the major ones. I'm talking about the aforementioned self-described feminism that - the producers would like us to believe - is supposedly behind some radical changes made upon the original movie (think of the exclusion of Li Shang, for instance). I'll be straight: there's no trace of feminism whatsoever in this feature.
The 1998 movie was not only far more intriguing and epic and endearing, it was also widely more modern in nature if you get what I mean. Simply put: widely more feminist, layered and up-to-date. And that's for another episode of ""the dangers of political correctness"", everyone."
179,"Very good film, yes it's like watching a different film to the cartoon version, but it's still very good in its own right. Very strong female lead, with excellent supporting cast. Don't listen to the haters, watch it expecting something different and you will love it"
180,"MULAN (2020)I finally got to see this movie last night after months of anticipation and it mostly lived up to my expectations. Directed by Niki Caro of Zookeeper's Wife this live action adaptation falls on the better side of the recent trend. Not that it says much considering the recent cinematic tragedies Aladdin (2019) and Lion King (2019) are part of the group. Most of the film is actually pretty great. Caro directs the proceedings with a questionable zest at times
The film is at it's strongest when it's more serious but delves into a goofy, cartoonish tone at times. That being said there's alot to love here from the beautiful cinematography to the gorgeous score, the inspired costume, make-up and set design. The central performance from Yifei Liu is accomplished and engaging. In the end it's mostly a great film even when it's at it's cheesiest. It may be not be flawless and in fact it's far from it but it's a worthy adaptation that never quite lives up to the original or it's potential but is a successful venture on it's own fantastical terms.****/5"
181,"Being a man myself, I am just so curious how a movie like this is empowering to women. It's not like we never had strong women characters in the past - Ellen Ripley, Sarah Connor, Kira Nerys, Leia Organa, or even 1998 Mulan. Back then they did not start out as superheroes from the start - no, they actually succeed due to inginuity, perserverance, determination, toughness, intelligence. Doesn't that feel empowering? Sure does to me... But nowadays, ""strong"" women just have some magical power, like the force. Apparently ""the force"" translated in Chinese is qi. You are just born with it, you don't have to learn it, train for it, or whatever. In the case of Mulan, you just have to accept to use it!So, then, what if you are a woman that was born without special powers? I guess you are out of luck - no empowerment for you. Maybe the idea is that all women are born with a special power. Now sure, I think each individual person is born in her or his own special way, but that is not the same.Now don't get me wrong, I am all for equal treatment of women and men (or races for that matter). I just do not understand how these kinds of portrayals are a good way to achieve it."
182,The Girl Power message made characters in the story do things that were weird.
183,"I was going into this with fond memories of the original animated movie, hoping this would at least live up to it's original but no. This movie absolutely bombed from the story to the fights to the acting. This movie completely changes what the original movie was about it removes characters changes there origins it takes a horrible direction going ""woke"" by making Mulan and insane perfectly coordinated fighter which makes you feel completely disconnected from her she's immediately supposed to be ""badass"" but in the original you see her growth with her training becoming stronger and strengthening relationships this gave you a relationship with the character an understanding but that's too much effort for any of the cast director or writers could give so they just took the easy way out and pivotal characters like mushu and the cricket have been completely removed and it changes the movie's direction drastically and not for the better. In my honest opinion this was such a blatant cash grab playing on your nostalgia please for the sake of your childhood please do not watch this movie it is a waste of money and time you would honestly have a better time watching Cats than this."
184,"How can I say it... Disney died a long time ago, when they start only caring about money. It's such a disappointment for this firm that made our youth so happy and colorful. They got rid off their best artist, best workers, etc just to please their shareholders and completely abandon their loyal viewers... They fix almost all their resources on fraudulent marketing now, because manipulation works.
Their last movies are just....bad, lazy and deceitful. Mulan follows this rule, trying to milk the cash cow again releasing a movie totally different from the original, but kept the title just to fill cinemas. Original characters are gone, best stories, best human moments and jokes are gone, everything is gone and they replace it with something without any soul. Is it to please Chinese Government?
This is the last Disney shamefully abuse me!"
185,"I like this film. People just hating on it because social media tells them, and only because people doesn't know how to think for themselves... yet.
The story isn't very similar to the animated film, which made it pretty interesting to see what it has to offer.
Also people going like ""they ruined"" is obviously just another mindless person, once again, don't know how to think for themself. People needs to learn how to be an individual for once."
186,Poorly acted movie.... should have not used that actress.
187,I really loved this film. I can't believe people are rating it so low.
188,"The picture of the movie is really beautiful. The last time I felt this way was the movie Heidi. The scenery of New Zealand and China in Mulan makes me yearn for it very much. I will consider traveling to these two places next holiday. Of course, the soundtrack and story of the movie are also great."
189,"It is the best Disney live-action movie I have ever seen. Mulan is kind, brave and sincere. I see hope in her. I think everyone should go to see this movie. It is great."
190,This movie is terrible. Deprived of the magic of the animation. Centrally focused on Mulan as a woman in a man's world and far removed from the several wonderful tales of her over the centuries. I had high hopes for this one and Disney has passed off another quick money maker which blame for failure will be on anything but Disney's direction.
191,"The costumes, sets, action sequences and special effects in this movie were wonderfully done! Kudos to the people involved with that portion of the movie! But in terms of emotional courage in its message, there were so many missed opportunities in this production that I left feeling... not much.The actors did the best anyone could with the script they had. You can see them giving a solid effort, and they deserve positive recognition for that. But there weren't any brave choices made by the writers, director or producers, and that made the whole film fall flat. In the animated version of Mulan, gender roles and the moral authority of command structures were questioned. They didn't choose to explore that with any emotional depth, this time.The animated characters weren't perfect icons of virtue and infallibility, and that made them believable. It made them seem human. Unfortunately, in the live action version, we received characters with none of that complexity. It felt like a salute to authority figures, where none of the choices of the privileged ruling class were genuinely questioned. ""The Emperor killed my father and stole our land."" Yet, somehow the Emperor was still considered worth protecting. That's a hard sell, especially without any explanation.This version of the story of Mulan apparently operates under the assumption that everyone receives their due so long as they submit to the will of the state. It came off as little more than an overproduced piece of authoritative propaganda.Oh well. Maybe it'll get another reboot, someday. Until then, flawed as it might be, I'll stick with the animated version."
192,"I was having doubts of watching it for $30, but as soon as the reviews came in from Beyond The Trailer - I went for it. Lo and behold it the new best from Disney In a long time.
Could this be our new Crouching Tiger? Sure why not! The movie is perfect, but you gotta watch it NOT on a phone, tablet, or laptop, but on a TV screen because the movie truly is cinematic. Perfect casting, epic action packed sequences, amazing visuals and production design, good enough humor, and most of all - very inspirational. Unlike Disney's live action of Cinderella & Beauty and the Beast where it is poor Hallmark channel / Lifetime network vibel... this one is it! Overall, It's better than Star War's The Last Jedi and Rise of the Skywalker!"
193,It was just crouching tiger hidden dragon meets mulan but in the worst possible way.
194,"I awaited this film with great anticipation. My first disappointment was when Disney cancelled its cinematic release in favour of assigning it to a premium service which added an overcharge to the price of a Disney+ subscription. Despite some beautiful cinematography and stellar casting, the writing was wooden and missed the great opportunity in a live production to tell a human rendering of a legend. There are better live action renderings of this legend. I give this film a 6 (fair) out of 10. {Legend}"
195,"Mulan is not as bad as some reviews indicate. I think some were overly harsh. It wasn't the most wonderful movie, but had beautiful cinematography, some and reasonably solid acting. The script should have been stronger, but the principal actors did a serviceable job. It was watchable for the most part."
196,"I know feelings are mixed because you didn't get your talking dragon, singing, and funny grandma. HOWEVER, this is one of the most well done of the live action remakes. It's visually, stunning. The composers outdid themselves, you still get the melodic structure of ""Reflection"" and other songs from the animated film at key moments and the execution is done so well. The film is also action packed and entertaining. Don't expect the laughs you get in the animated film, go
Into the film knowing it's a different movie and different telling of the legend of Hua Mulan. I love that it is not a line-for-line remake of the animated version, if I wanted that I would just watch the animated version."
197,"Really don't get all the hate for this and why it has such a low score. Not seen the animated version so can only speak for this one. I loved it, the kids loved it, that is all that matters. Are people rating it low because it is a remake? Out of spite? It is certainly not because it is a rubbish film, it is a Disney kids film for christs sake, what where you expecting? A best picture Oscar winner? 22 years ago the kids got an animated version and loved it, now they get a live action version and still love it."
198,"This film start with the narrator talking about Mulan, and a little girl chasing chicken scene! As turnout, this film is about a female daughter ""Mulan"" disguise as a male soldier on behalf of her father to save the Imperial from the invasion of Bori Khan! Entire film quite slow, and full of annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the upside down view fighting scene, overuse of the slow motion fighting scene, and overuse of the phoenix flying scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, Mulan causing mess while dealing with the spider at the Matchmaker's teaching session! Barely intense scene is, Mulan using her ""Qi"" and causing avalanche to defeat Bori Khan's army! At the end, Mulan kick the arrow to kill Bori Khan! Commander Tung awarded a new sword for Mulan! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
199,I came into this movie knowing it wasn't going to be the same as a cartoon made 22 years or so ago. If you think it will be. Move on. And as far as the price I came out cheaper then I would have taking all my family to the theater. 4 adults 3 kids. Your talking $100 dollars just in tickets. If you don't like the price you can wait the three months when they drop the price.
200,I'd probably give this an 8 but I'm bumping up to a 9 to counter the snowflakes that give a film a bad review because they weren't happy that the film wasn't what their il informed expectations were. This film was not meant to be a real life version of the original. It's a new take on the story and it was done so so well. The casting is so great and the performances are beautiful. Don't go into the film expecting the original but find joy in the small nods to it that they make. Really great stuff and made life in lockdown a bit more enjoyable.
201,"People are idiots plain and simple. The acting, action, story were all perfect. I wish it was all done in the native language though. But everyone wanted a shot by shot remake. Thats what made Lion King so stupid, and Jungle Book too. I hope we get another one, it be nice. But people prob ruined that."
202,"A beautiful legend with a touching storyline. The acting, production, and directing are very good. Some scenes will definitely touch your heart.Yes, I believe it's better than the animated version. Some hate about this movie are probably not in the quality but in the $30 price tag on Disney+. I'm expecting improvement on ratings once it becomes free on December."
203,"Growing up as a girl in the Middle East is a nightmare; but when I was young, Mulan taught me that if I work hard, if I develop problem solving skills, and if I embrace my unfeminine treats, I'll be alright, and that I'll eventually find myself. Just because I don't fit into a certain expected category doesn't mean I should!It taught me a father-daughter relationship is at its best when the father loves and is honored by his daughter no matter what society or traditions dictate.What is this movie trying to teach? You should be born gifted in order to break out of the certain mold you're expected to fit in? We have duty to the system..? Women can be masculine and man up and compete with men? China has beautiful landscapes?
I'm not even going to talk about anything else.Nice virtue signaling attempt, but you failed and ruined a brilliant story with so much potential."
204,An amazing balance has been achieved in all aspects!
205,"This is unlike the original animated one from the 90s, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. It's a decent film for what it is, a modern take on a story that is centuries old. It tells the tale of a female warrior in ancient China who concealed her gender.If you expect a version similar to the original motion picture from the 90s, you will be very disappointed"
206,"Most of these live action movies were almost scene for scene remakes. This one was different and I thought they did a great job with it. There were lots of colorful scenery and the story played more like a kung fu movie with a touch of Disney. Maybe that's the issue so many have with it - they want the cutesy same old thing. All 4 of my kids loved it, age ranges 9 to 17. We have already watched it twice as my daughter requested to watch it again for her birthday.Thank you for trying something a little different!"
207,"Honestly I've enjoyed watching the movie, this is an achingly beautiful movie. The filmakers were deliberate about creating stunning visuals and succeeded - Mulan is one of the most beautiful movies you'll see this year.but there were many ups and downsUps: It's unfortunate it isn't getting a theatrical release since it's a stunning visual spectacle. MULAN is visually gorgeous and one of the better live action remakes. Impressive fight choreography and inspires and challenges its younger audiences every step of the way.While the film as a whole doesn't set the world alight, it's refreshing to see a Disney live action remake at least tweak the plot and characters to liven it up. The cinematography, choreography and sound effects are all high points.Mulan, enlightened feminists who understand that women empowerment can only happen once they have risen to the challenge and stopped portraying themselves as perpetual victims.downs: She was flipping through the air, kicking spears out of the air and deflecting them back at the bad guy.
& Suddenly all his soldiers disappeared and the villain must burn the emperor alone & the movie got rid of so many good things from the original and they don't even got mushu or general shang like bruh seriously? I personally hate that mulan is played by a person who supports police brutality.....Thx for reading, Enjoy watching the movie & judge by yourself :)"
208,"The cinematography, the elaborate sets, artistry, costume and wardrobe, visual effects, fight/sword choreography and the horsemanship/archery on the battlefield were all phenomenal. Some of it reminiscent of the battles scenes from Games of Thrones, except with significantly more saturated colorful and no blood spillage and gore. They get away with it by cutting the camera to another camera just as blade is less than an inch from being thrusted into an enemy solder. So we get implied kills without the carnage.The only shed of blood comes from the witch that nicks her finger on Mulan's sword and a few small droplets fall on the ground. Its a high budget Disney flick with the high production values to match but restrained by the PG-13 rating.The acting is about average. I did not see anyone belt out an academy worthy acting performance that left me impressed. Fans of the animated serious will take issue with changes from the original animated film. But I did not watch the original animated film so I had nothing to compare it too.I honestly think this film will have many friends and enemies in the the industry. Not because of the content of the movie, but buy the business experiment Disney is doing by providing a $30-PPV option that are scare people who work for the entertainment theaters. If Disney succeeds and makes a large amount of profit, other companies might be tempted to jump in and bypass the theater openings all together. Those industry insiders can see their theater chains under threat.Today the best image quality for films is arguably at home with newer OLED technology TVs that really make these film pop in a way theater projection cannot. Yes, the $30 price is higher, but I can see friends chipping in to watch this on a really high end television and HT system and make better food at home. In that case, the $30 price pails in comparison to taking a family 4 and concession goodies can easily go three times over that initial price of $30. Disney promotes itself as a family movie company so....hmm the writing is on the wall. Theaters are dying. OLED gives better image quality *Today*, QD-OLED, even better tomorrow, and MicroLED display technology in the distant future will just pat the dirty down over the grave of the movie theater houses. The die-hart theater lover will go into the dark kicking and screaming as the home screen becomes the new venue to watch these films.EDIT Sept 16, 2020.
Apparently there is a huge political Brouhaha over this film that I wasn't even aware of when I wrote my original review above which explains the passionate dislike for the film. Non-Asian Americans just don't like how the songs were left out from the original animation. Asians (both in the US and abroad) are angry at the protagonist, actress Yifei Liu, support for the Chinese CCP crackdown on the people of Hong Kong. And in some irony, many mainland Chinese are upset of the portrail of the real life historical Mulan in this film as being pro-emperor (pro establishment) rather than pro-family. So it seems Disney managed to piss off everyone. In any case, I still think its an okay Kung Fu action adventure even if it isn't historically accurate. Perhaps Disney should stick to animation instead of live action. Their record with live action isn't very good lately with fans."
209,"Why why why do you keep doing this to your movies, Disney? The cartoon is awesome this movie has the obligatory caveats: looks great, action good high production; but is terrible. As a political progressive & I actually know what political labels mean the messages is overriding the story. Its no wonder so many people dont like progressives. Heck, i dont like whoever wrote this movie. ; save your cash & watch someone else's copy if u must but its painful."
210,"I can't explain how terrible this, God forsaken abomination is.Editing, was sickening.
Story, SO much worse.
characters, terrible.
No music.
Added nothing of value, only took away.
Literally the worst a human could've produced. This is the new bottom of the barrel in disney's live action remake - cash crabbing, vomit of movies.Hated every minute, can't believe I made it through the movie."
211,"This is my first exposure to Mulan. I have not seen the animation or knew the tale. I loved Yifei Liu is the title role. The embraces loyalty, bravery, truth, and family honor. It was slow at times and sounded dubbed. I liked the fighting scenes and it is the few places where I tolerate the anti-gravity aspect."
212,"Watched this epic with my wife. She was so animated watching it. She made some of the costumes which were outstanding. It's such a travesty that we we cant watch it on the big screens. Filmed mostly here in New Zealand, it demonstrates perfectly the scenery and skills of Kiwi filmmakers. I dont usually like these types of movie but I was immersed from start to finish."
213,"Very forced plotsShe falls in love with the partner suddenly, if they had delayed that after he had done more things to deserve it, it would have been betterThe witch becomes obsessed with her, even giving her life for her without almost knowing her.Many characters without personality
villains have no personality, specially the boss of the enemies gives pity.The witch's arc is not well developed eitherthe companions do not have personality either, there are too many(4-5? I am not even sure!) for no reason, just to force a similarity with the animated movie (which is a masterpiece)The high level that Mulan has fighting is not justified at all, yes, ""she has a high Chi"" etc ... but that seems very forced to me ... Mary Sue character. In the cartoon she earns that with hard training.Very silly that bad guys would shoot an archer or a small group of archers with a catapult.I didn't like the performances very much either, I saw them very bland in general with a few exceptionsThe only good thing in the movie is the photograph of the scenes."
214,"This movie in my opinion was overall pretty well made. Sure there were areas that fell short, it seemed as if the scenes were too fast paced and the story moved a little too quickly. There were also some inconsistencies throughout but what movie doesn't have those. What's annoying is the people saying this movie is terrible because it is nothing like the original Mulan. What original Mulan are we talking about here? The animated movie? I hate to break it to you guys but the original Mulan wasn't a animated movie, it was a story Written in Chinese scripture. This movie is meant to more accurately depict the true story of Mulan without it being westernized. Saying this movie is terrible because there's no music number like the 1998 version is just plain idiotic. The movie is great overall. If you had never seen the 1998 animated version of this story, and watched this, then most people would have a different opinion. Just because it's a live action does not mean it's meant to be a complete remake."
215,"I really understand that a movie with real actors can't be the same thing as the animated movies. Also I understand that you have to do some things differently in the plot . But this one was bad. This is not mulan, it feels like other fighting chinese movies. Very very disapointed by this one."
216,"I want to start by saying I am someone who's seen the original a couple of times over the years maybe once as a kid and then in the last few years in the background as my kid watched it, but I don't really remember many details other than a lot of singing and that there was a little red dragon played by Eddie Murphy.My wife is Asian, she loves the movie it's her favorite Disney movie. She's a bit irate over this new one and is deeply disappointed there's none of the original songs and that they changed most of the story...All I can say is with all the hype for this movie for all of these months, I don't expected it to be better than this. The story didn't move me, it didn't feel powerful, I wasn't left thinking how I can't wait to see it again. I remember when I watched Moana with my kid who was 7 at the time, I was in the middle of the movie thinking ""wow, this is that Disney magic they did it again"". I get Aladdin wasn't exact to the old one but I thought the same thing with that. The same thing with the new Beauty and the Beast. The same thing with the new Lion King.It's a shame because here you have this all Asian cast, which I know how important it is to the Asian community, but then Disney drops the ball. The love story was weak, almost non-existent. The lesson in the story was, well, what is the lesson to the story? I just feel like I didn't really get much out of it. And it does seem weird that they took a Disney movie that had music and then took away all of its music.I thought maybe they were doing that because the story was going to be so epic and they were going to be edgy and that this would sort of make up for it, making the softness from a bunch of Disney songs ruin it but the story wasn't epic, it wasn't edgy. It was weak sauce the whole way through to the ends. I hate to even say it.I think everyone can agree it looks like a big budget movie, it's Disney. But there was no raw emotion, the acting all around was meh. I guess after aaaalllll this waiting and having to pay 30 fricken dollars that I was hoping for a movie that left me saying ""wow, that Disney magic again""."
217,"Yes, its not the usual Disney's song filed Disney movie. Warriors dont sing that well and all in all it was a treat. Cant understand why so much negativity in the rating, as after this long lock down, it was a treat nevertheless.
And the cast, Yifei Liu, Jet Lee, Jason Scott Lee, Li Gong and Donnie Yen well played their characters.
It's a good watch, dont hear what other users are saying, get your popcorn and enjoy."
218,"I loved that movie and the beautiful dedicated warrior who's actions tell us, what's life without value morals sacrifice dedication and courage, a strong message for those at the highest level of our society today that have failed to accomplish anything but chaos and division..."
219,"Mulan 2020 is a handsome production, an epic of classic Disney imagination. Whether or not you've seen and loved the animated Mulan of the 1990's I can imagine you falling head over heels for this splendid family adventure that empowers not only women but children in general to follow their hearts and engage in imaginative, heroic, adventure. Director Niki Caro has made a stunningly beautiful film, with dazzling colors and rich detail in every frame. She pays tribute to some of the animated film's most iconic visual moments, like the burned-out village left in the wake of the invaders, and the avalanche that helps turn the tide of battle, and Liu Yifei imbues the title role with ample heart and emotion."
220,"Disney serious missed the point where the animated version is concerned. What made the animated Mulan more loved and exciting wasn't that Mulan had powers or had acrobatic skill. Mulan was Clever and Resourceful. It was her courage and mind that made her unique and interesting. Not like this movie, it went and placed all of those qualities with typical CGI for Asian action films. Totally unrealistic and dumb. This movie missed it's mark so much, even the ending, which was suppose to be epic, fell flat and unimpressive."
221,"I think they did a great job with this movie! Loved the fight sequences, the emotional scences, the aesthetics and styling. While there were things that could have been better, I feel this is an absolutely wonderful film- family-friendly, entertaining and has a great message. Just enough comedy to balance a wartime story."
222,I hear people complaining saying it's not a Disney movie like who cares theres some good fantasy martial arts in the movie and it was a entertaining movie overall.
223,This movie isn't even close to the original . I'd rather look at a wall for two hours than watch this again . Wish I could get my money back
224,A well made remake of the original movie. It breaks the stereotype of how daughters are only meant for marriage but shows how they can bring honor through their family in other ways as well. The screenplay of the film is good. Action is well executed. The sets and the visual effects are great. Performances are good especially by Lou Yifei who plays Mulan and Tzi Ma who portrays Mulan's father. Overall definitely watch this one which brings back nostalgia from your youth.
225,"The two points I give this film are for the songs. Christina's new powerhouse version of 'reflection' is amazing and I'm proud to say, ten years an indie artist named Rosi golan was touring the country playing people's living rooms. We hired her for my sisters birthday and have been friends since. I am SO proud of my friend for her beautiful song 'loyal brave and true' which Christina also does justice.The movie itself, I don't know where to begin what a hot mess it was. The original film had at least humor and romance in addition to the action. This was straight action. The original was made for everyone. This film felt made for boys. I was bored out of my skull the Whole time. There wasn't even a conflict to add, like in the original when she pretends to be a man. She blows that cover almost immediately,
So what's left? The witch/magic storyline was absurd.It's really hard to talk about a movie so bad. It literally did nothing right."
226,"I liked it. I wasn't expecting or comparing it to the cartoon version. I saw it as a stand alone movie. I saw a Father's struggle wanting to allow his daughter to be who she is vs how society expects a daughter shd be; how both succumb under pressure to conform to finally suppress the 'chi'. 'Chi' in Chinese means 'energy' which boys presumely have plenty so it is ok to be active whilst girls are supposed to be gentle, soft, subdued. Active girls (tomboys) are frowned upon. Whilst the original ballad focuses on the message about filial piety (honouring family), this version focuses first about being 'TRUE' about oneself and accepting who you are (many scenes point to the last word on the sword) and laid in the original message in the end (honouring family) with a new word added into the new sword. The witch was to depict how a rejection of one true self by society can create a monster out of a person.It did not try to take the focus away with a unnecessary love story or music score. It wasn't to entertain by infusing humor of 3 goons. It was not a movie to entertain. It had a message which many people I felt missed it because they were looking for something they were fed in 1998. Look deeper folks.."
227,Visually stunning. Great story. Not a remake. But a new great film.
228,"A poetic journey of epic & emotional proportions, fueled with a profound and pure humanity, and with a subtext that is gonna resonate with numerous people all over the world ...First, the photography and all the visual language that accompanies you from beginning to end, are a true delight for the eyes ... A majestic fresco, with a color treatment that highlights each & every shot. Yes, the photography is really striking and can't leave you insensible. Also, the music inhabitates every chapter with an immense grace, and accompanies this emotional journey alongside Mulan in the most grandiose way !The screenplay keeps the same main beats as the original animated version, but upgrades the storyline as a whole, with more subtlety and depth ... Yifei Liu has a magnetic presence and transmits us a lot of emotions through her so expressive eyes ...Of course, the choregraphies and the staging also have a very finely artistic language, which flows like a smooth dance, throughout the movie ... Obviously there are some striking scenes and images that nicely punctuate the adventure and participate to make it evolve into an ever more epic & emotional way.Mulan's interactions with each character, are a big strenght of the movie, they all are a step and a deciding element in her evolution as a woman & hero, from the very first scene up until the very last scene.A beautiful movie, on many levels."
229,"You could spend more money on this story to make a great movie, cheap very cheap... i think old good people from Disney has retired and new young guys are destroying the Disney history... rest in peace Disney..."
230,"No mushu, no songs, ok it's fine but the plot man... Come on director.. The plot is all over the floor. This movie is so disappointed. I love the acting and the choice of characters but because of the directing, the movie falls deep down the rabbit hole. For instance, how did mulan teleport behind the enemy and start shooting without the khans noticing. Plus, how stupid it is for them to shoot mulan using a frickin catapult. I mean they literally push the catapult 180° just to aim at mulan, instead of going there and attack by foot. The catapult even missed and caused the avalanche. How can you missed, from afar you can accurately hit the turtle formation but upclose to mulan you can even hit her. How idiocy is that. Plus many more errors in the movie. I am so disappointed. Come on director..."
231,"I don't understand why there's bad reviews. I truly love this movie, The actress that plays Mulan did an amazing job, not to mention all the other actors that made the movie what it is! I understand that people might be upset because there's no sing-alongs but it was One of my favorite movies that has been redone so far, when it comes to going from animation to live action they nailed it. Took away 1 star for the Soundtrack."
232,"It is not the same Mulan movie that I grew up watching but seems more geared towards the culture for which it is trying to portray. Definitely worth watching and would recommend, but you have to go in with an open mind and not expect it to be the live action cartoon."
233,"I am shocked to read reviews like ""Disney is dead"" and ""Disney ruined"" and the ""Greed of Disney"". The movie was funny at times, sad at times, endearing and thoroughly entertaining. The cinematography was beautiful, the acting was good, and the story inspiring. What more do people want. This was definitely one of the better remakes of the original anitmated films."
234,"I think the movie is quite good. Aside from any political controversy this movie had, this version brings a different portrayal of Mulan. In this story, Mulan portrayed as a ready-made superhuman warrior with Chi. This is the opposite of the classic Mulan where the character even though got talent and potential, still, needs hard work to gain the achievement.The story itself focused on the fourth virtues: Courage, true to yourself, loyal, and devotion to the family. I understand why fans enrage and unsatisfied by this movie because I admit they make huge changes from the classic one. These changes include:a. They substitute Mushu with not-so-useful Phoenix (who, literally do nothing in the movie and just occasionally appear)
b. Add new characters like The Witch. I think Disney added this character to emphasize the message ""true to yourself"" but fail to impress the audience. I kind of like this character, but her development throughout the movie feels forced and half-baked which make people think her appearance in the movie is unnecessary. Also, how she ends up, really really predictable.
c. LESS ROMANCE, as a big fan of romance, quite disappoints me. They change Shang with Honghui, there are scenes indicating romance but not much, and the story never focuses on itLast but not least, the thing that bothers me maybe the fighting scenes. Illogical and forced. I will give you two examples of this.
a. When Mulan and some troops chased Bori Khan troops, all the Mulan's troops got shot by an arrow and fall from the horse (the remaining two just run). Only Mulan able to dodge the arrows (how silly because even though they want to highlight Mulan's skill, they make Mulan's troops look really lame compared to Bori Khan troops where some of them had the ability to dodge arrows)
b. Mulan appears unrealistically beautiful and clean even in the midst of war (She didn't cut her hair like in the classic, not even tie it). She also seemed not bothered by her long hair which several times cover her eyes. How the hell someone like that even survive and able to fight in a war.Overall, this movie is still entertaining in its own way as long as you can ignore the differences from the classic one.SIDE NOTES: I still prefer Donnie Yen and Jet Li play for action/kung fu movies. I feel so strange saw Jet Li act as an emperor, somehow warrior or Kung Fu master suits him better (in my eyes). The same feeling for Donnie Yen, he felt so rigid in the movie. I think this movie kinds of wasted two great martial artists."
235,"I definitely think that you should watch the movie if you are a fan of mulan and don't mind the bad reviews it's just because they were disappointed that it was not the same as the original the story is almost the same but with a much stronger lesson and mulan is has a more powerful personality, I think that if you are going to watch it having in mind that it will be same then let me tell you it's not the same it's BETTER"
236,"This is not the cartoon Mulan, but it's visually breathtaking, the story was well conveyed and the message was inspiring."
237,"The film is laden with cliched concepts without accounting for daily life dynamics. It was not required and honestly a overkill . Disney should have added a more chutzpah element and contemporary liking's of audience's without compromising the soul of the film. However, the film is aesthetically pleasing, carefully designed for Disney's astroturfing, and passable for one time watch."
238,"This film was such a pleasure to watch. There is definitely a different vibe from the original Cartoon version of the film but this one elevates the message and tone of the story overall to have that 'epic' feel to it. The fight choreography is beautifully done and the cinematic experience is still there even from VoD. I applaud Disney for another triumph, Mulan 2020 is definitely one I will be rewatching often."
239,"This is a very good movie. Probably the best I have seen so far this year. Not that there is much competition unfortunately, but still.The bad?
Only cinematic issue I had was the sound design. Felt off somehow. Perhaps they filmed it in several languages or something and a lot of the fights and explosions and such do not hit the mark. This is the only really bad thing about the movie; the sound design.
Mulan is also a bit too Disney-ish sometimes. There is no blood, no real danger, and if you have seen the animated original there is nothing really new. I also think they could have done a little better with some fight scenes and perhaps a couple of actors were not spot on.BUT, with that said;The good!
Almost everything else. This is just as funny as the original. Great characters. Great story. Great acting. Great directing. Great cinematography (except sound design and a few fight scenes). This is a great family movie. Despite some violence, the Disney-ish with no blood etc make this a great watch for the whole family.I really enjoyed this movie. It is not perfect, but its entertaining and fun from start to finish. Loved every second of it. If they'd nailed the sound design, put more effort into the fight scenes and exchanged perhaps 1 or 2 actors, I would already state that this is the best movie of the year. Unfortunately they did not, but this is still best I have seen so far 2020.A strong 8/10 and I highly recommend."
240,Thought it would be epic from the trailer but it was just lame. Kids walked out half way through and the final battle was weak.
241,"The visuals are the best thing about this movie. At many places the story didn't make sense (I think they forgot that this is not an anime where the timeline doesn't need to make alot of sense). The movie didn't really explore the feminist theme as well as the anime did, choosing rather to spend more time in the training camp (yet they totally left out any growth about her powers). Its sad that we didn't get to see anything about Mulan's chi. There is alot to be disappointed about in the movie, but i still didn't feel bored as the visuals were done so beautifully, it can actually keep you engaged till the end. Sad as it could have been better though. I would have given it 6 stars, but subtracting 1 in solidarity with Hong Kong. The whole world is with you in your fight to defend your freedom!! ""Courage Loyalty Truth"" the actress really should have thought about her dialogues and what she fights for in the movie, before making those unfortunate statements against Hong Kongers. Cause it actually hits you when you watch the movie."
242,This movie is one of the best that disney released this year. Its based on the original Mulan story and not the hollywood animation movie with singing and dancing. Thank god! People should stop comparing it to that one. Finally Disney took some risks and not just copied the Animation - and it turn out amazingly!
243,I don't know why everyone is hating on this movie. I'm glad it came out on Disney plus instead of the theaters. It is well worth $30.
244,"I'm old and don't generally like any remakes. Aladdin was horrible, Ghost busters was an abomination.This was very good and I have watched it several times.Using the original music numbers and incorporating it into the sound track was brilliant. There are the original characters and some new ones that are well incorporated into the story.unlike the original this is aimed at a higher age group. It's incorporated some of the classics of Chinese film making and of course Disney film making to make a nice hybrid.Something new, because it's a live action movie, it has more a relationship between audience and characters, they do a good job pulling at hearth strings, making you laugh and making you really dislike the bad guy, all good things from this film enthusiast's perspective.people who expect a cheesy easy spit out of the original were never going to like this movie and since people today love to hate we all knew it would happen.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and will watch it again"
245,"I don't understand all the hate this is getting.
In my opinion it's a nicely shot, suspenseful story with a strong message. Watched it and I would do it again to be honest.I think it is getting a ton of hate because it's from a different culture with different values and instead of trying to understand other's actions, thoughts and motivations people rather hate, protest and boycott. Which sadly selldom leads to peace. That is also a point where I blieve the movie is lacking, the other side is just introduced as plain evil and the side of the protagonist is the talented and well meaning one, and it doesn't work like that in the real world.Also the movie was like ""fantasy"" with elements of magic, and that hurt the credibility of the protagonist a bit, because in hardships the magic was always there to help her so the plot could continue. So the writers were a bit lazy in motivating everything with logical events. But if you see it as a childs movie and pretend that you are a child (which you will have to, because a movie about war only showing blood once is cringe) then it's thoroughly enjoyable.This sounds ironic, but really. Just go ahead and watch it, see for yourself."
246,"This film is stunning. If you'rea fan of Chinese epics, then you'll be pleased with the style. It's similar to Jet Li's Fearless. Great use of Chi and lore. The choreography was very well done also. Yes this film is different from the animated. That's a good thing though. This way it doesn't feel like the original was replaced. Now we can enjoy the same story in two films. We get a great musical in one and an epic in the other."
247,"From the start, great action, colour, acting and a wonderful story!Maybe nothing like the original story, (not the cartoon one) but hey, what does it matter.You can sit the whole family in front of the tv for this and enjoy.🙂"
248,"This live action remake of the classic animated movie is not a great one, but it is gorgeous, colourful and brave enough to make a compelling retell of the 1998 film.While not matching the position in the disney compilation of animated movies, this live action 'Mulan' was a satisfactory success enough which might still catch the attention of the viewers.
My Rating : 3.5/5"
249,I miss the original. This did not honor the first one.
250,Just stick with the classic version and keep your happy childhood memories. And where is let's get down to business!
251,"I'm glad this adaptation tried to do something different, instead of just re-telling the same story. It has a different identity and it touches you differently. Yes, there's no Mushu and the cricket is remade to be one of the soldiers instead, coincidentally also named Cricket. There are some new fantasy elements to the story and comedy takes a hit as the action becomes more prominent. I liked the movie, though the cinematography, especially during the fighting sequences where there were a lot of flips, can make you a bit dizzy from time to time.Oh, and I wish they would have explored ""Chi"" just a bit more. It's a cool concept but it's just forced into the movie without any clear explanation of what it is. It's signifying that it may be some sort of a mystical power but it's hard to understand right now."
252,It's great that Disney didn't do a similar or exact rendition of Mulan. As a society that evolves so much into materialistic and self actualisation. Mulan reminds us that without our families we wouldn't be the people who we are today. So be grateful for the things we have.
253,"The first 10 minutes of the movie was a bit disjointed but after that, it was solid from front to back. I liked the character development and secondary stories. I loved the larger than life battle scenes and epic panoramic sequences. I did not see the original cartoon and judging by some people's reaction, glad as such. This was a standalone movie made with grown up themes."
254,"I thought id be sad without the singin and Mushu but the use of the Phoenix as a guide and the original soundtrack making appearance it was the finals touches i needed. The iconic lines are there in a very ""real"" way. Its truth to the original tale of Mulan and the fight scenes are very ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Its one of the best live action Disney has ever made, if not the best one!"
255,"Pretty shots, good fight scenes and action and following the original story, it was ok. It's not the best remake but it's not the worst"
256,"I am pretty sure that everyone who were involved in the making of this movie worked hard and did their best. But alas, their best isn't enough. Everything about it screams mediocre.I know it is a standalone movie and it has no obligation to follow the cartoon, but one can't help to compare Mulan to Mulan. The cartoon may have a lot of plotholes (such as, why is it the empire of China had practically no troops and had to depend of fresh ones, also it only has one general/one warlord? and one platoon?). But the cartoon has to be praised too for it's funny moments and quirky characters.This live action one has nothing stand out. The witch is just, another witch, just like those in The Mummy or Indiana Jones. The phoenix did nothing worthwhile too. What's the point of inserting her in the movie? The main character is, well, a cardboard character. She has no interest in man. She's the strongest one in her team somehow and she doesn't need help. She beat the big bad by herself. (Compared to the cartoon version where she did it by teamwork). She can't really tell jokes. She did nothing but kick ass and be cool. She's a character that even middle schoolers can come up with. No originality and stand out quirk at all.What a shame. My final score : 6/10. Which fits the mediocrity of this movie."
257,This movie more than delivers! It is an absolutely beautiful work of art! It's a MUST SEE!
258,"This movie is so boring, don't waste your time watching it."
259,From watching the film and the cartoon there are some differences but still the same basic story. It still a good film to watch and I will buy it on Blu ray when it comes out. I hope that there will be a sequel.
260,There is a reason why Liu Yifei was voted worst actress in China for 3 different years.That reason is very evident in this film.
261,I absolutely loved Mulan!Amazing movie!! If you're expecting similar comics lines and Mushu and lucky cricket like the cartoon then don't watch this one !!Read up in why they changed things to respect Chinese culture !! This version of Mulan is closer to the actual story not the cartoon classic.Mulan was beautifully orchestrated as Disney is always the best in music I enjoyed this masterpiece!!You will live without Mushu and the music and it has beautiful orchestra music throughout the movie kind of like pirates of the Caribbean!!Well done Disney !
262,"I don't understand why people hated it. I loved it from the start to the end. The point of this movie is the strong emotions it leaves you with. I really felt connected with the meaning of the story. It's wrong to compare it with older versions, I think people should watch this and consider it as a seperate story. It's sad how underrated this movie is."
263,"This live-action remake of Mulan not only represents a waste of energy and money, but above all a lack of spirit and empathy. It is a new view and it's not allowed to be compared to the animated version, so it has its personal path and unfortunatly fails miserably. If this movie represents Mulan's myth, then we are left with nothing but a powerful story, represented in the worst possible way. To enrich it all, there are bad special effects (VFX and CGI) followed by one of the worst editing ever seen, where it keeps focusing on useless elements of the plot making the result confusing and making the film worse than it is. Last but not least, despite the excellent cast, there is a lack of desire in acting, as if everything had been rushed for reasons to be deciphered. The worst Disney live-action remake so far."
264,I love mulan when I was a little girl.So I am excited to see this movie and it deserves.The scene is so beautiful and the fight is amazing.It's tell us to find our place in the world and find yourself. I WAS CRYING when xianniang died She was a tragedy but Her experience deserves each of us to think deeply.
265,I quite enjoyed but its not a remake. All the bad reviews here are from people that didnt have their expectations met. Its a different movie.
266,"First of all, I have to say that I haven't seen the cartoon version of Mulan, so I don't have any emotional filters. What I see is a brand-new film. I think it's very good. From the perspective of picture, music, or intention, it's very Disney, but it's out of the framework of traditional Princess movies. If I choose, I hope to take my children to see Mulan, and the values it reflects are very suitable for teaching Children, the only thing that bothers me is that I can't watch it on the big screen, so I can only give nine points for it."
267,"I was originally very excited to watch this movie and though $30 was a little pushing it I was willing to pay for it now I wish I hadn't, The concept of a new female character in Mulan was ideal and with the character pushing Mulan towards discovering herself this would have been a great addition to the movie but instead they created a character with no back story, millions of plot holes, no reasoning behind her motive and her death was sudden, unnecessary, and didn't make any sense in why it would be considered female empowerment."
268,"It is quite a good movie. There are a lot of negative reviews but those reviews seem to be expecting that it would be identical to the animated film. If they made it exactly the same the wouldn't be any point watching it. As long as you watch it with the understanding that it is a different story you can see it is very well done.
The film makers have decided for a more realistic style following the wuxia genre. There are some fantasy elements but a talking dragon wouldn't really make sense so I'm glad he was not included in this version.
The action is fairly limited. It is a shame to have superstar martial arts actors who didn't have much opportunity to demonstrate their skills. However I guess they wanted to keep it family friendly."
269,"I loved it!! It has everything you would expect from a disney story. Strong characters, nice scenery, great story!"
270,"There are so few good family films that teach values these days. I have not seen previous versions, so no preconceived expectations or biases, which may explain the other, lower rated, reviews. But, for me and my family , we wholeheartedly enjoyed this film. I watched it a second time, something I rarely do, and still got teary-eyed at the ending even though I had already seen the film! Wonderful cinematography, music and story. Just ridiculous to give a Disney film like this only 1 star, as some reviewers have done. A very good film all around. I suppose some people do not appreciate how rare a good family film is these days. Very good movie."
271,This film is so beautiful and lovely scenery ! Very much enjoyed this wonderful adaptation of the classic story
272,This film is so lovely and well done visually. The storyline is similar to the original! Highly recommended
273,I thought this film was alright for what it was ! Not the best movie and also not the worst. The film is visually stunning to watch and the costumes are nice as well. Recommend it for the visuals !
274,"This film was entertaining and visually stunning if nothing else. It was lacking in some categories, but overall it was pretty good content ."
275,"Please ignore the other reviews that have been written by people who are sad that the nee Mulan movie has no musical sequences or a talking dragon.
This was a brilliant movie with a beautiful and strong message.
It was entertaining, a great story and carried really well. It's not the be compared to an animated version because this was a movie of its own.If you can watch a Disney movie without the expectation of a musical sequence in every other scene and talking animals then this movie is fantastic. However the negative reviews, as I'm sure you can read for yourself are in the majority from people mad that this wasn't a sequence - sequence remake of the animated Mulan and that it didn't have nice songs and funny talking animals."
276,"This movie was disappointing. It makes no sense, it is a bland cocoon of what could have been good."
277,"This film is nothing like what was promised. It's not a more realistic version of the animated version and doesn't even hold to the values. The whole point of the ballad, and original film, is to show that while men and women have small differences they are both equal where it matters. The animated film manages this rather well as both Mulan and the male troop grow to become warriors together. In the new, 'more realistic', film Mulan is born with Chi, which is shown to be basically magic. This gives her an added advantage when it comes to fighting and so doesn't really promote the message that all women are equal to all men. It totally muddle the message. Then to add insult to injury they make her completely personality-less and give her no real drive of her own.
Mulan is meant to be an intelligent woman who uses her brain to overcome issues her physical abilities. This Mulan has none of that and makes stupid nonsensical decisions.
Overall just save your money and either watch the animated Disney version or one of the many Chinese films based on the ballad. This film is a shameless, directionless cash grab that doesn't have a clue what it wants to say. Worse yet, it's not even entertaining, you'll be frustrated with the character the whole way through."
278,"The action scenes are so cheesy, watching the movie till the end was really hard and difficult"
279,"I went into this movie with really high hopes, I had only seen actually really positive reviews going into this. I don't know who those people are but I think we watched different films. I knew well ahead of time that we wouldn't be getting any of the bangers from the original film, so I was ok with the lack of songs.. my thought was that they were trying to go for a more serious, more historically accurate/sensitive type of epic warrior tale. I was wrong, somehow I actually found it significantly more silly and ridiculous than the original(I LOVE the original but its an animated children's film so silliness is expected.) The first time we see her save herself from falling off the roof I thought... I'm gonna hate this.. and boy.. I really did. If you're going to watch it, wait until December and get it for free. Thankfully I split it with a couple of friends so it was pretty cheap."
280,"I'm being a bit kind by giving this movie three stars. I was disappointed, but I think the reason I was disappointed was because I went into the movie with certain expectations that were not met..They advertised and billed this movie like it was going to be a serious action film. And that's what I was expecting. That's what I was looking forward to. What I got was a mish-mash of Disney-esque martial arts.The problem with this movie is it couldn't decide what it wanted to be - it wavered between serious action film, and cutesy Disney movie. It kept switching back and forth, which kept distracting me. And finally at the end, it dove, full blown, into Disney realm with techno-color backgrounds and plot holes so big you could drive a truck through them.I wish that Disney hadn't made this movie - I wish a different production company had made it. Because it would have been a great action/kungfu film! But the Disney cute/cute/haha ruined the movie.Now that's an adult's opinion - I'm sure kids will love it. Which I guess is the whole point of a Disney movie.Also - as a final word. So NOT worth $30 to rent!! Wait until it comes out on bluray."
281,"It's enought i was excited but ...
Bad Movie....
This movie look like a clown🤡"
282,"When will Disney's execs figure out that to make good movies requires talent! This dumb, fem-fest screening, with an enormous budget is an absolute waste of time. To remove all the songs and all the charm from the original legendary cartoon, and make some ridiculous feminist sh... that nobody wanted is a stupid, if not a criminal decision against all fans of that beautiful tale. To make a good movie, requires talent!!!! It's not a gender issue, it's more of what people want. Before you start judging me on this review, all of my female friends had told me that this movie is an absolute garbage that should not exist. It won't get a ""cult classic"" followers. It's not good in any way, shape or form. It's just a pure Sh.. Similar to Avatar (the cartoon) in its quality."
283,"I'm sure I wanna be a girl like Mulan. Loyal,Brave and True. Yifei Liu did a good job."
284,"Didn't watch the original so reviewing it in it's own right.
It's a little corny and overacted in places, but that's Disney. Another slight negative is that the battle scenes seemed somehow small and not grand / epic.Overall though, mostly good acting, great effects, excellent music and engaging story. I'm not really a fan of the Disney corporate machine, but to be fair, they were always going to be up against it when they made such a popular original in the first place.Way better than many of the low scores on here."
285,When I heard there are going to make major choices to this remake I was mad at first but aftter I saw it I wasn't bothered at all. It was nice to put some parts from the original in the movie and the changes were good and so glad this movie was not political
286,"The cartoon is much better. It was entertaining and I liked the different perspective on the story. The mulan actress was excellent and well cast. It wasn't the greatest movie ever but it was engaging to watch. There were scenes that seemed half baked and the acting was periodically dry. Overall, worth at least one watch. Not worth $30 though, glad we got to watch it for free."
287,"Just two words: a mess. Don't pay to watch this.This Mulan is not the real Mulan. It feels like to watch Naruto instead a story of an intelligent woman, using her brain to face most of the situations.
At some point I felt like watching an anime as Dragon Ball: people super strong, absurd martial art, magic with no contest. I mean.... Dragon Ball is far better atleast it didn't ruin a great story at all.I add nothing more to say."
288,"I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. there were apparent flaws like too many cuts in some fight scenes and some awkward moments that were done much better in the original. but it's easy to let things like that slide when your being thoroughly entertained.lots of cool scenes, good music, and beautiful shots. the main actress did a good job of making me feel mulan's awesomeness. and i was emotionally invested in the characters. oh and did i mention donnie yen is donnie yen? i donnie yenned so loud when he donnie yenned onto the screen. i had no idea he was in it. donnie yen. lol (1 viewing, 10/14/2020)"
289,"Disney please stop remaking every old movie with bad stories and bad directing, the cast is good but the storytelling and sequences of events is very dull and make drift away every time."
290,"I watched it despite the bad reviews as people just love to hate! this movie missed the mark by a long shot, no real story and a huge let down."
291,"I wish they hadn't called it Mulan. If it wasn't I'd probably five if a 5 and just say eh, but the reason it's getting all these poor reviews is because they did call it Mulan remake.Honestly, I don't like it but I understand why they got rid of Mushu. To make it more realistic. The trailer looked awesome. I'd been waiting for months since March to be able to watch this. Then it finally hits amazon to buy and I'm utterly sad.They didn't develop characters at all. They could've developed her military friends soooo much more. You hardly catch their names much less get any personality from them.I feel bad for the cast. I'm Chinese and I was so excited to see tons of Asian actors get roles in this but they deserved a better screenwriter /producer / director... somethingMy least favorite part is this crap with a witch and how there's now funked up magic now. The original animated developed her character and had her grow from a girl scared to save her father to learning discipline and hard work in the army. Instead they totally MAKE FUN of authentic Chinese CHI!!! It's not some psycho magic.I was so excited for the authentic cast and wanted to see some great fighting scenes. Instead you don't know who's who half the time or where they are. You also get this constant rotating of the camera during the fight scenes that'll give you a headache. So sad."
292,"After a lot of delays Mulan is finally here, a stunning, impressive movie with a good directing. Still couple of errors I'd say through the movie but still is insanely good. In my opinion, this is one of the best Disney ever done..."
293,"My favourite movie at the moment..I love you Mulan..I love her bravery , staying true to herself ,her courage and respect she had for her family."
294,"She is my goddess, her acting is great, although niki caro is bad director but doesn't mean this is bad movie, it's good movie, easy to understand"
295,I haven't seen the 1998 animation and i have thoroughly enjoyed this movie with my family. I think you have to treat this as an entirely different movie from the 1998 version if you will watch this movie.Great storyline and cinematography!
296,"Really bad. The plot makes no sense, the action makes no sense, nothing makes any sense. Go watch the cartoon version instead and save yourself $39."
297,"Really enjoyed watching film.No blood and guts. Like the characters.
Story was good with good acting.Best film seen in a few months and I watch a lot.I will watch it again soon.Dont be put off by the negative reviews."
298,"MULAN! If you thought this would be a live action movie based on the original movie, you will be sorely disappointed (As was I).If you thought this would be a good live action remake of Mulan, you will be sorely disappointed (As was I).This movie was TRASH! I don't even know why they named this movie ""Mulan"" because it was hot garbage. My kids over here like ""Where is this character and where is that character and who the heck is that?"" And not even ONE song?!? What a waste of $200 million. Disney needs to get their crap together. They basically duped people into paying for a completely different movie by naming it ""Mulan"". We all still paying to see it though and Disney knows it 😂😂"
299,"I have no idea how to explain my feeling after watching or its better to say wasting my time!
Even weaker than very very ordinary chinese movies!
Starting like telling story and jumping and diving from step to step without logical connection!!
Im not professional reviewer, but as normal people who try to watch movies saying : weaker than even very very ordinary chinese movies!"
300,"Decent movie, not as good as the original but that is typically the case."
301,Why will anyone take a fun and good animated movie and turn it into a bore !
302,I don't know how you've done it but the cartoon was more believable than this movie. I'm still watching it but that battle scene with the avalanche...was so poorly done.It's such a shame. Read the other reviews - I'm sure we all say the same thing.
303,"I will say this to start!!! This is the best Live Action Disney Film based on an animated film that I have seen to date!!! It has action, drama, romance, fantasy, and Martial Arts!!!! I recommend everyone see this movie it is great for families. But let me say that this movie will push those boundaries of PG-13.
From here on is a spoiler stop here if you wish to remain in the dark.....From the opening scene until the final heart twisting end this movie is great. When she is chasing that chicken and showing off what she can do was great. The addition of Jason Lees Character and the ""Witch"" are great surprises in this film. There are many great actors in this film that and seeing several that I know from previous films and TV were a great shock to me as for the first time in a movies history I did not want to spoil anything about it before I personally got a chance to watch it.
The fighting scenes were well done!! They were both fantasy and real all blurred together. I have seen many Martial Arts films in my life and although this will never be called a Martial Arts film, it does have that feel about it without stepping to far away from the Disney feel. My final thoughts are this... this is what I image a live action version of animation being and I really hope that Disney looks to this as a new stepping point for movies of this nature!!!!!!"
304,"Just seen this most awaited title on OTT. I was looking for Mulan in action,( in red dress) fighting with enemy, but unfortunately we have to wait till one hour to see her in action. This is big drawback of such movie, it should have a very first scene at the movie to bind you till end and rest story can be shown in flashback. After passed one hour, action is coming in action and we can see amazing war fights sequences for near about 45-50 minutes. Means this movie only entertain you for 40-50 minutes, rest part looks unnecessary or less important due to poor story line and script. Donnie Yen was wasted in his role. He has no scope for his fighting skills. Likewise Jet Li. Though Mulan is brilliant in action but failed in emotions. Overall it is above average movie, not so good or not bad. Only amazing war scenes, breath taking archery actions, beautiful photography and good background score are plus points of such weak story line movie. It could have been better. Many viewers talked about maker Disney, but it is an unnecessary issue, movie has its own existence so it is good or bad only depends on itself, no matter which company creates it. Don't judge with ratings."
305,It was definitely a shock when I realized this version was not like the animated BUT I enjoyed it nonetheless. I laughed throughout and even shed a tear. Ignore the low reviews. Do yourself a favor and watch. You won't regret it!
306,"Beautifully made story with a great twist compared to the original animation. The cast and actors along with the filming and sceneries are just stunning. I'd watch this over and over again. Don't get fooled by the less review, this movie is a modern version of the original animated movie - nonetheless still following the famous story. Highly recommended!"
307,"I enjoyed this film so so so much. Instead of being a copy-and-paste animation to live action Disney remake, this rendition of Mulan is a totally refreshing retelling of the original. The storyline follows a similar narrative, yet it takes a grittier and more action-packed approach, showing breathtaking cinematography throughout the journey. A new addition to the movie, *villainess* Bori Khan, is a 'reflection' of women with power, same with Mulan, and the film shows how differently it implements their place in society. The GIRL POWER moment that they both join forces, although it is cheesy, is a great lesson for young audiences.
There are a fair few rough spots and *eye roll* moments, but I'm thrilled to see a Disney live action remake finally take on its own course, instead of regurgitating their originals. Thoroughly enjoyed."
308,"Do not watch it if you are expecting to see Mushu or a musical; this is a different story. Also, the battle scene in the mountains is beautiful!
This movie is not worth 10 stars, obviously, but I'd like to see a better general score for this film as it deserves better."
309,"I really don't understand all the negative reactions to this movie. It really exceeded my expectations! And that's coming from someone who's been turned off by most of the Disney live action remakes. I found it surprisingly refreshing and enjoyable from start to finish.The acting, cinematography, and visual effects were all impeccable, in my opinion. And the fight scenes were fun to watch! Seeing a role model like Mulan in the flesh is really impactful, and I wish I had a movie like this when I was little."
310,"I don't understand all the haters on here. This was a great movie. Great direction, great acting, great scenery, great camera work, great plot. It had everything. Thank goodness they didn't use the shaky camera technique. This was a well done movie. They really made clear the pressure she was under with her culture as it was. And they had really great battle scenes. I totally loved it. A must watch movie!"
311,"Yifei Liu is good at martial art and she's performance touched me a lot.Tzi Ma is a excellent actor who influences mulan.In a word,it worth a ticket."
312,"I have bought and watched it on Disney +. The story has a high degree of completion, compared to the 1998 animated version of a lot of changes, can be seen as a new Disney princess film. Don't worry if you have animation complex, many classic scenes and BGM will be reappeared.
Liu yifei's acting is very good, from a young girl, after a variety of experiences, grow into a soldier. The eyes are funny. The scene is very atmospheric, almost all live action, Gansu Danxia, geothermal, snow mountain, palace and bustling street scene, all reflect Disney's intentions. But veteran actors like Gong Li, Donnie Yen and Jet Li remain steady. Let's see a girl grow up"
313,"This movie managed to knock Aladdin out of the number one spot in my mind. I really, really liked it and wanted to give it to everyone around me. Warm and energetic, Disney is so good at it!This movie managed to knock Aladdin out of the number one spot in my mind. I really, really liked it and wanted to give it to everyone around me. Warm and energetic, Disney is so good at it!This movie managed to knock Aladdin out of the number one spot in my mind. I really, really liked it and wanted to give it to everyone around me. Warm and energetic, Disney is so good at it!"
314,"A girl becomes a warrior, a warrior grows into a leader, and then she becomes a legend. Too surprising a movie, the core theme of ""loyal brave and ture"" is also very appropriate. Actors are excellent, especially female characters. The director is good"
315,It's a litteral Hollywood bow on the knee to their new lords. Goodjob Disney!
316,I would rather deal with the Wuhan Flu that sit thru another viewing of this woke garbage.
317,I enjoy the film from start to finish. This film is for adults and please rate if you are an adult according to the movie. Jiayou Liu Yi Fei
318,I am not sure why Disney went with this movie or what audiences they were targeting . For kids there are not very many wow special effects . For adults not to many action sequence. Movie runs at a slow pace . It's pictured beautifully so 1 Star for that . Not worth your time until this is the only movie you can watch and you are stuck on Mars and no other options .
319,"Bad story, illogical actions. Boring for kids and adults. I dont know what Disney were thinking"
320,"Its clear to see that this is disneps attempt to further burrow itself in the chinese market. the whole chi thing is kinda cringe, and feels like a shallow attempt to symbolize female empowerment. jokes didnt land, and investment seemed impossible. all in all, really bad movie with a high budged so it doesnt seem as bad as it is.4/10: nope nope nope"
321,"I wanted to like this so bad. A classic disney movie is all we need during these times. While the movie does have some ups including great action scenes and stunning visuals of nature, it fails to effectively immerse the viewer into the story or be able build characters whom we find ourself cheering on. As mentioned in some other reviews Mushu has been scrapped and in his place we have a witch whose story has not been developed and leaves us confused. Worth watching but don't pay the $35."
322,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it was not good. The CG was not the best, the acting was not the best, and worst of all, adult Mulan lacked personality for most of the movie. The ancestor part was just kind of thrown in there, as if there had been more about the phoenix and then they cut it out, or they threw it in at the last minute. It didn't really tie into the movie very well. While I was able to do suspension of disbelief for some of the movie, there were a lot of parts that were just so far-fetched I couldn't overlook them. For example, why didn't hawk lady just kill the emperor when she was right there pretending to be a soldier. The fighting was very odd. The camera angles were jarring at times and the fighting style didn't seem consistent. Sometimes it was very much like pirates of the Caribbean and other times it was like a Kung Fu movie. I know a lot of people put a lot of work into this movie, which makes me sad. I wish it was better."
323,"Mulan (1998) is my favorite Disney film. It has a powerful message, great music, humor, and joy. This new adaptation leaves you feeling meh. There's so joy built into it. The plot changes make it dry and a very distant relative to the original."
324,"After the horrendous Lion King, I didn't have any expectations for yet another unnecessary Disney adaptation. Luckily, Mulan wasn't one of the Disney animations that I was obsessed with as a kid so i barely remembered the plot and it almost felt like a new film.Imagine a person painting a palace. At first, it looks splendid with a balanced use of colors and beautiful backgrounds. The painter is no Da Vinci but the work is formidable and we can see it coming into shape. Then all of a sudden, the painter feels like she is running out of time so she just dumps the remaining paint onto the canvas. Before handing it in, she desperately adds a few final touches to try and bring out her initial intentions. This is what watching Mulan felt like.Disney took the understandable direction of scrapping the songs and most of the goofy stuff in an attempt to make a Chines-epic instead of a copy paste of the original. Three quarters into it, I flet good about the characters and the atmosphere. Liu Yifei was great in her organic portrayal of a strong heroine without forcing anything whether through action or dialogue. Then everything became a crazy Kung Fu movie as the pace turned up 300% and all the build up and consistency were tossed away in favor of action and forced messaging. They did try to patch it up in the end but the spirit was lost.Mulan is an ok film to watch as it looks good, has pleasant characters, a bit of jokes and good messages. Unfortunately, these Disney adaptations can't decide if they are proper films or animations where things can happen without logic and characters can evolve in a split second for reasons unknown to humankind. Mulan was a perfect opportunity to scrap all magic and crazy acrobatics to just have a wholesome movie that could be enjoyed by all ages. Sadly, we get another kids film but this one has no joyful songs or sweet gimmicks.Movies.shmovies on Instagram"
325,"Mulan is an ancient Chinese story set in a magical colorful world where things get quirky as soon as the best characters come on the screen. All of the characters are memorable without feeling silly. The film is daring enough to make its demands clear. In a time of war there can only be commitment. There is no courage without fear. That is the theme on which the film presents its battles of will from. There is always a line you cannot or are not able to cross. The battle between the two protagonists always stays light which only better conveys subtly showing the perceived empathetic role of women in the society of that time.There is finally a movie that brings a lot of the most famous Chinese actors together in a passionate portrayal of battles that show no deceit. There is nothing sinister in the movie all but a simple victory for those on the right side of history.Even though the film might some to seem to some to be heavy on the main actress the film never forgets that there are others who matter too. A presentation of armies, its composition and their capabilities look believable and the strategies employed are never over the top.Anyways a great movie with great actors. A film with only positive messages all around but still enough meat to spark a conversation about interpersonal issues that any film about a society inevitably shows. Family friendly, hell yeah, and the fighting scenes are technically amazing and inspiring, Nobody should disengage anyone about seeing this movie.Thanks China. (Made In America) :)"
326,"Yes I agree, that the songs should have been put completely in the movie, with the lyrics being sung. But I can't deny that it' good as it focuses more on the empowerment of women, which I think is their main goal. There were more self confrontations and reflection which is very beautiful, I think our generation really needs that. And the events that followed were quite realistic(if you were in that world). Of course there's always room for improvement for the next movies to come. Overall, it's good and I recommend this movie."
327,"Another great remake from Disney! I can't understand those stupid low ratings. THIS MOVIE IS NOT THE CARTOON!!! This is live action, human acting. I love all the modifications Disney made. It makes a lot more sense & logics in a real world rather than the cartoon. I love that they explored more on Mulan's childhood, her activeness as a child & the relationship with her father. And I can totally see why Disney doesn't include any songs. This is a war hero movie, not a musical. Overall, great movie, good action & storyline. I can watch it again & again."
328,The movie is a wonderful action fantasy. It stands on its own. Well spent 2 hrs. Would love to watch it again.
329,"This movie targets girl empowerment, and projects matured role and reality in human life. Stop comparing and whining because it's different from animated film. The old film is more appropriate to children's fantasy."
330,"This is the best Disney live action remakes ever!!!!
Mulan live action is so Awesome and Incredible and it's way better than the original!!!!
I LOVED DISNEY LIVE ACTION REMAKES!!!!"
331,In my childhood i used to love this cartoon and watching this remake as an adult really made my day ❤
332,"A moving and empowering film that tells an intriguing story. Rather than compare this to the animated original, consider it on its own merits."
333,"I really enjoyed the movie. Not only because in these times that we are living in, we deserve to sit down, relax and enjoy, but because once again, Disney took a beautiful animated film and made it into a masterpiece.I did not only loved the subtle message to girls that we can do and achieve anything men can, but also with virtue and family values.Excellent acting, beautiful photography and a wonderful script."
334,One of the best movie of all time ..amazing super movie10/10
335,"The past is past and should stay there. If you were expecting nostalgia, signing, and eddie murphy then u don't want remakes u want to watch the old movie."
336,"I had some doubt about this version because Im a BIG fan of the original. No songs, no mushu. But they brings the story in a totally different version but keeping some storyline that make mulan, mulan. 2 hours that have past like 15 minutes. Great job about special effect, acting and producing. I completely recommend you to watch the movie! Ive watch it with my boyfriend and daughter of 5 and the three of us complete loved it!"
337,"Everyone that hates this movie seems to be comparing it to the cartoon. I've never watched the cartoon so I guess I'm not spoiled. I didn't expect cutsie side kicks nor a musical, so going into it I had no preconceived expectations. I thought is was highly engaging and enjoyable and well done. A cross between Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and the Matrix! Those of you who just wanted a remake of the cartoon are misguided in your criticisms."
338,I really enjoyed the film!! A must see!! No spoilers!! Watch and see!! 👌
339,"Remember to tell yourself this is firstly a Disney Movie which means it isn't supposed to be a pure action movie.
For a Disney movie there is a lot of action and grand battle with an avalanche but there is a likeable character with a story and a journey. There is a nice message about family first and a current message about gender equality.
The look of the movie is well done. The country scenery from mountains to desert is picturesque and the cities and palaces look right not overdone but tasteful CGI.
Crystal Liu is a convincing lead. She looks tomboyish enough when dressed as a man so that her disguise is believable. But when her hair comes down she is pretty.
The supporting cast is impressive. The villains are good. Gong Li is more animated than usual and an attractive and memorable villainess. Jason Scott Lee has aways been an enthusiastic actor. Anson Yo as the lead romantic interest isn't impressive enough. A bit underwhelming. Too small a cameo from Ming Na Wen.
The fault is the dialog and writing lacks humor. There is a little but not enough.
Still this is a well made movie. Liked it more than the recent Live adaptations like Beauty and the Beast and Maleficent 2."
340,"I think there should be a section for American reviewers and another for the rest of the world. This retelling of the ballad is not meant to be copy of the animated story.
This is supposed to be simply another version of the legend and stands on its own:
Great cast, particularly lead roles
Great settings, backdrops etc
Gorgeous cinematography
Spectacular sets and special effects
Cohesive story from beginning to end.If you are expecting Eddie Murphy jokes, don't watch it.
If you want to watch an action version of an ancient Chinese legend about leading women, family and honor, knock yourself out."
341,"Is this an out of season april's fools joke? Neo from Matrix is jealous of the moves, not to mention the 5 supersoldier who took a city."
342,"There's not many films that makes the whole room filled with tears and this story was extremely well made with beautiful scenery and mature acting.We had many expectations since the original animated film was great and a family favourite. We had high hopes and many reviews put this film in the negative. I know there are many political and other issues at play and if you don't agree with those issues or actions that is fair. If you don't want to support the film and what you think it stands for all to you. I don't think the negative reviews rang true in our instance as the actors/actresses were really good. There's a level of maturity that was needed for the actors in their roles. The story was heartfelt and the women and girls in the room felt empowered. Each scene was beautiful and the story powerful.Sacrifice, family, courage, staying true, loyalty, bravery, and honor. Fa Mulan is a story of the ages and this version is one we could watch again and again. I feel sorry for the controversies. Watch the film for what it is and you will enjoy it.It was good to see Asian representation in the movie. It's got a coherent storyline and the characters get all a great plot. The story seemed rushed between some characters and the developing camaraderie wasn't like the original film but that is not enough to take away from this film.Watch it for the story."
343,"I have watched it from Pakistan. I really like it, it's an amazing movie with incredible acting skills displayed by every actor especially Liu Yefei.
Donnie Yen, Jet Li etc too were good.
Thumbs-up to Direction, Storylines, Music everything was perfect!"
344,Clearly many people have reviewed this movie based on political issues - some probably never even saw it. I do not review many movies - unless very good or very bad. This is a very good movie and was done very well. Ignore the political rubbish and enjoy this movie - we both did.
345,LIU yifei she is mulan herself loyal brave ture she shows all these in movie mulan is strong in body and inside.she is proud of women
346,"Dont listen to the haters on here. They are clouding their judgement of the movie with personal political opinions of one of the actresses. Since when is it a sin to have a difference in opinion?! We need to learn to accept not everyone has the same opinion and that is 100% okay!
The movie was beautifully done. The music was good. It was very inspirational as a woman to see strong female characters. If you have a daughter take her to see this movie as it is very good."
347,"It wasn't a carbon copy of the animated movie but that's a good thing.
I liked this version equally as much as the animated version."
348,"This retelling of Mulan is breathtaking. The scenes are so uniquely shot. I agree that I was iffy about them not including Mushu, music, etc. However, after educating myself on Chinese culture and that Mushu was disrespectful, I understand their decision. Like stated, this movie is not supposed to be light-hearted with a bunch of fun songs. It's about war. It's about a warrior. They did a great job twisting the story into their own version, while honoring the original Mulan poem and the animated movie. As a fan of the original Mulan, I am beyond proud of this film. I laughed, I cried, and I ended the movie feeling so grateful to have experienced it. This was definitely worth the wait and paying the extra money to see it. I highly recommend!"
349,"Mulan is an excellent female film!
The beginning of the film is very similar to the animation, and the subsequent plot adaptations are rich and connotative. I have to say that Niki Caro has completed an outstanding adaptation. Some Settings and lines in the movie may be only girls can understand that feeling! And, I really like the new story about Gong Li.
Finally, I have to say, thank Disney for choosing Liuyifei as Mulan.There is no doubt that the performances contributed by Liu Yifei laid the foundation for the excellent performance of the whole movie."
350,"I find it to be perfect, and I don't mind the changes whatsoever. The cast was perfect, the score was beautiful, the story complex and well-constructed, the visuals were stunning, and the score from Harry Gregson-Williams is just beautiful. I love it, and I'll blow my brains out before saying otherwise."
351,"I really wanted to like the Mulan Remake.The original Disneys Mulan was my favourite out of all Disney films and still is too this day, and I will always love that movie for what it is.
I was so excited to see that they were making a remake, that it was supposedly going to be more realistic and serious, and that it was a live action movie. But after watching the movie I was greatly disappointed.Now I'm not the type of person to relentlessly hate on movies, I don't even usually write reviews. I just accept movies for what they are and consider both the fact that being behind the scenes in the makings of a movie can be harder than it looks and that if a movie tries to portray something in a way I wouldn't that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie.
I'm also a firm believer that just because a movie is a remake, or goes off the same story like a sequel, doesn't mean it has to be exactly the first movie. Along with the fact that I'm aware our expectations often come to ruin a movie for us.
But the Mulan live action remake was a disaster.The first thing that caught me off guard was the very CGI element of the first scene where we see Mulan use this ""chi"". This is not an uncommon theme nor way of filming in east asia and it didn't really strike me as that strange, but this is when I realized this movie was not going to be so realistic after all. I also realized that Mulan was going to be considered someone with great power even from childhood, which made me feel like this was an entirely differents story, a story of someone other than Mulan.
Still mindset on giving the movie a fair chance, I decided to see the movie as an attempt at being just more serious, rather than actually realistic. And in a way I was more right on that than I realized.Every decision anyone makes in this entire movie is entirely nonsensical. The only one that isn't is Mulan leaving to go to war instead of her father, not to mention in this movie they pay no credits to make her difficult decision feel like anything... from the smaller things like hiding a spider on the table and risk her image making the weirdest moves ever, instead of making everyone else in the room aware of it or simply ignoring it, to other characters in the movie acting like a child making up imaginary stories in the playground. I felt from early on, the script would be hard to swallow.Remember how in the first movie we got to see Mulan overcome the struggles of her biological disadvantage along with the disadvantage of being raised as a woman with no real fighting experience and come out on top using her wit and skill and by training hard alongside the men in the army and outsmarting them during a test that genuinely takes some strategizing?
In the live action remake, Mulan is just already way stronger than everyone else due to her chi, the movie clearly portrays her being slower than the men she trains with, enough to annoy her to use her chi to gain the upper hand and then getting upset. Despite the fact that she's now portraying herself as a male, which according to this movie is how things would work in china... But none of this works like actual china.This makes you feel like the only redeeming quality she has on the battlefield is her chi, and by default makes her a weak character.
Even in east asian films where they use powers that seem to be outside the physical ability, it's always something you have to train. Even the ones with mary sues like this one turns out to be, they also have to train that. But in this movie, Mulan just has it all figured out already as a child.So in the middle of the war of very few small platoons, for whatever reasons they didn't call in more extras, Mulan decides that hours after promising her platoon that she will protect them, her entire platoon gets shot down and she straigt up leaves, riding off into the mountains after a number of men.
This is where she meets a woman who also has ""the power of chi"" (The cultural missunderstandings are grave...) and also the power of shapeshifting. Because why? I don't know.
This is part of a type of magic that in east asian culture and film is usually considered forbidden. So why is she using it? Because she's part of the bad guys? I think this unlikely because in east asian film it's not even used by them, usually.
Along with the witch trope not being a thing in china either, but apparently they thought this movie needed some western standards!As she gets knocked out and takes some time to nap before going back into battle, she decides that in order to ""make her chi clean"" she has to drop her disguise, to be true to herself. In my honest opinion there was no reason for her to come out like this right then and there, because she would've been killed for her decieit, that's how it worked.
Along with the fact that in order to be true to herself, she could have focused on why she was doing this, instead of the fact that she was forced to lie due to society's rules and expectations tied to the law.
But we don't get Mulan's audience with herself to figure out what to do.
She just straight up gets on her horse, and on her ride back to her army she throws her fathers beloved armor on the ground, the one thing that is meant to protect her insides from getting punctured and slashed open, all the way back, scattering it between the mountains, straight up ditching it like it was trash.
Clearly her fathers belongings, and her life, mean nothing to her.
And she also takes the time to let out her long hair in the wind so it can get in her face mid combat.When she decides to reveal her true identity, before gaining any form of r espect to preotect her from the obvious repercussions of their laws, she's exiled and warned she will get executed if she shows her face again.
This isn't far from reality, but what happens next? She goes to do just that, show her face, and talk to them again because she has information about the enemy's next move.While I could imagine if she was lucky this may grant her to be spared for the purpose of bringing this information to them, what actually happens is that the general just straight up makes her the leader of her platoon and sends her to take care of it.
Are you joking? The man who told her she'd be executed hours ago, makes her the leader.
Why does this feel like an over-dramatic discord server with a bunch of children as admins?
This would never happen in the real world, not back then nor now.
But wait, it gets worse!:The king decides to casually stroll into a construction site by himself in the middle of an attack on the capital as if nothing was going on. In which he gets captured, obviously.
Mulan is making her way to save the emperor, and as she comes on site, the big bad guy shoots an arrow at her, and for absolutely no reason whatsoever the witch that Mulan has been fighting throws herself in front of the arrow.
She gives her life for someone she just met, knows nothing about and have no history of an alliance with.
There's no indication as to what her strategy is either. She just does.
Speaking of strategy, of all the power she promised having, why is this her move?Mulan decides to go home to remedy the shame she caused her family, fair.
She goes home, everything turns out to be happily ever after and I'm not even really watching anymore because this movie made no sense and none of these characters have any meaning to me and I'm just so disinterested in it at this point.Mulan was a real person in history. I understand if someone wants to make a more serious movie about her, and not wanting to include a comical relief spirit dragon. But this movie cannot be taken seriously at all.
I also understand if they don't want to make it the same exact movie and only make light references to the original movie soundtracks, but the way they implemented the literal song lyrics in bits and pieces really awkwardly made me cringe, and the nonsensical plot was a disappointment.tldr;
2/10 - Written like a 14 year old making bad mary sue fanfiction with terrible missreadings of chinese culture and more than bordering on disrespecting it.
Made an IMDB account just to review this."
352,"It's an absolute cash grab and a very poor soulless product made by Disney to cash in on nostalgia. I beg you, DO NOT WATCH this movie, do not pay to watch this, it is horrible and deserves not a single cent. It is also not faithful to the original animated movie. I would give this zero stars if I could, but it is absolutely terrible."
353,"When Mulan (2020) was announced, headlines and press all over the world had their eyes on this up-coming live-action remake of the 1998 homonymous cartoon. Mulan's filmmakers promised fans a film immersed in the Chinese tradition and culture, true to the original Chinese poem, where the famous heroine first came to life, and stripped from the western details added in the original animation. Turns out the film half followed the plot line set from the cartoon and half tried to get to the core of Chinese history and literature, failing at both tasks. A hybrid film that is westernised in almost all its aspects and presents half backed characters with non-existent or badly executed character arcs, Mulan (2020) is disappointing under multiple aspects. Mulan stars as a superhero who doesn't really have to fight hard and long to prove herself, find her place and achieve the respect of her fellow companions; her strength and tenacity are justified by a misinterpretation of what ""Qi"" actually is - an energy that flows through all living creatures -, that is represented on screen under the idea of a ""magical power"". Hello Force, is that you? The other characters portray the exact same problems: bad characterisation and lack of a cohesive and coherent character development.
Live-actions and remakes are a market that nobody asked for and yet still exists, and this film is the living proof of this statement. Expositional dialogue after expositional dialogue the script has crushed Mulan's character into another Avenger of sorts. If the goal was making the story more authentic, the film has completely missed the mark."
354,"I want to give credit, where credit is due. The scenery is quite beautiful some places and most of the time, the actors do a good job. The story is mediocre, at best, and doesn't quite land the Asian vibe, neither the western vibe. I just kind of floats in the middle.Here are some of my main frustration points:Chi. They introduce and talk about chi, as if it is some sort of magic. Everyone has chi, we are told, but we only see two people with ""strong chi"" or ""chi magic"". Mulan and a Witch. It is never explained what chi can do and why it gives someone the power to change forms or turn into thousands of birds or anything...The only explanation as to why Mulan is so naturally gifted, is because of ""chi"" - which she apparently has more of than average. From the start it is established that Mulan is ""over-powered"" and apparently is quite masterful of many things, without needing to train or earn her power. This sets us up with the feeling, that Mulan will overcome anything without having to put in much effort, which makes her very hard to connect with as a character.The side-characters are boring. They introduce Yao, Po and Ling, Cricket is also a person apparently. There are a few interactions, and honestly seeing those guys together is quite nice. Too bad we get very little time to get to know them. They also created a new character, Honghui, who acts like a ""love interest"" throughout the movie, until the end where Mulan decides ""No, I'm a 2020 women, I don't need a man"" and she leaves without him. What was the point of even adding him? Just DON'T have a love interest AT ALL if this is the message you want to send. She clearly liked him, so why leave?They introduce this Witch character, who can shapeshift and is a master warrior. Creating this character is rather uninspired. Not only that, she - and the change they bring with her, aka ""chi magic"" - seems to actually go against some of the teachings of the original 1998 movie. The women of this movie (the Witch and Mulan) are only as good/better than the men because they have this (unfair?) advantage of magic chi. The original movie taught us that resourcefulness and intellect is what gets Mulan her victory, but this movie teaches us that if you are born with extra power, then you can win. It's a strange message.Apparently a lot of people can catch arrows mid-air, just before they get hit. This becomes a thing throughout the movie and it's a bit stupid. It almost becomes a point of the movie, since the villain dies to an arrow which he did NOT catch. That arrow was kicked off by Mulan (yes, kicked... She kicks arrows and spears and.. Don't get me started).The Witch can take form of any person, often flies around as a falcon, and can shoot ninja-stars with lightning speed. Major plot hole: Why didn't the Rouran raider leader just ask her to fly to the Imperial City, fly up to the emperor, take him out and throw the country into chaos? Afterwards they could swoop in while the army and the cities were in disarray, and they could have taken over the country without suffering too many losses. Instead they use her to speak with the emperor (privately, that is) and lure him into an unfinished temple...Finally the villain actually captures the emperor (not before Mr Emperor slaps some bad guys to death with a curtain of course - no I'm not kidding, it's a curtain). The bad guy doesn't kill the emperor yet, because like any other villain he must do it in some elaborate way. So, he has some melted steel and some torches and wants to burn the emperor alive.Overall a lot of minor things that I didn't really like:
The scenes between Mulan and her father are slow and don't feel as emotionally strong as they do in the 1998 version.In the end Mulan loses her fathers sword and says ""I now know how much that sword meant to you"" but, like, how does she know that? They didn't tell us or show us why this sword was important. There was no ""this was my fathers sword, he earned it when blablabla."" or ""It has been in my family for generations"" or any of that stuff. Just a sword, dude.We don't see any other witches or hear why they are feared. I mean, the Witch shows is why they fear her, but she explains her own backstory that people distanced themselves from her because of her power. Why did people fear her, before she even started doing bad things? It's not explained. Suddenly it doesn't have anything to do with being a woman, but has all to do with this magical power which no-one even explains to us.It doesn't have any of the lighthearted Disney moments and it doesn't have a strong emotional impact.Overall: Uninspired, boring and full of clichés. Mediocre movie, with some laughable martial arts moments. Once in a while they cite the original songs, though, so that's nice... 2/10."
355,"A very good movie. I consider my investment of 21,99 Euros @Disney+ as well done."
356,Wrong choice of language. Should be in Chinese !!! Looks like a freakin dubbing.The main character was given a very minimal dialogue (i guess due to languange barrier). Bad make up bad acting. Disapointed...
357,"Disney real adaptation of the best movie, Mulan fighting scene is too cool!! I hope to see Mulan in the cinema after the epidemic is over!!!"
358,"I'm a huge fan of the Mulan animation, however I knew that this film would NOT be for children.The live-action film beautifully demonstrates female strength and power with the use of symbolism, a beautiful picture and magnificent epic scenes.I am personally not crazy about magic (i.e. shapeshifting) or fantastic, impossible, Jet Li style stunts. I also thought that Disney could have released this to the theatres instead of charging people an arm and a leg on top of channel membership for this film. Luckily I was invited to a family member's house and I didn't have to pay personally. Otherwise, I would have waited for it to be released with a standard price."
359,Very good as a Disney movie. Mr. Liu's acting also contributed greatly to the movie. Must see.
360,We don't have Mushu here. We don't have Li Shang here. We don't even have a song in this movie which disappointed me. But this is not remake of animation. Just like The Lion King or Maleficent. You must evaluate this movie from a new perspective.
361,"This movie was great. Its not like the animation and it's not supposed to be. If you want singing dragons then stick with the cartoon. This had great action, heart and message. I will definitely be watching this again"
362,"I saw Mulan last night and it was amazing. The storytelling was excellent, the dialogue and acting were great, and I liked most of the changes (even though I was kind of sad about a couple changes). The action was epic and the moral of the story was beautiful, not to mention the scenery was fantastic.
So I was genuinely shocked to learn that it got some bad reviews. Sure, this film has a somber tone, but that's what makes this movie good. Besides, there are a few jokes in this movie. Give this movie a chance. It is a masterpiece that is unique and special in its own way. This movie has so much depth. I think this film will go on to become an underrated classic."
363,"Nice reboot of an Old Poem.
Not the animated Mulan we know.This is something different that simply targets all type of audiences.The movie is like a Living Ancient Poem, like it was meant to be."
364,"The movie isn't terrible. It seems like with each new live action remake, Disney is learning. Aladdin is my favorite of the remakes but it still lacks in areas.For people seeing this earlier than Dec 4th free, they're going to be disappointed in dropping 30 bucks for it. I did enjoy the movie but I doubt I'll ever need to watch it again.The first hour is a slug. All set up but there really isn't anything compelling to make you care about these characters. There are some good shots and scenes. The archery pursuit scene in particular. I could've watched that for another 20 minutes.Something that seemed odd to me. While Mulan had her secret, the writing seemed stronger. After her secret was out, it seemed that the writing got lazy. When the team arrived and the one place, soldiers dropped in on them, and Mulan says, ""Ambush"". Come on! Can you be any lazier? Of course we know it's an ambush. I don't Facepalm at movies often but...They didn't take advantage of combat scenes. They really could've went with some epic battles. There also was never a time where I felt Mulan was in danger. Of course, this is a remake kid film but with her power, I felt like she didn't even have to struggle to win here. At all!"
365,"I was one of the many people that was not excited for the live action adaptation of Mulan just because of how terrible the trailers were and after seeing the animated Mulan and hearing about all the changes they were making that just made me even more worried about the movie. But I have to say after seeing this movie I actually really enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to. Mulan(2020) isn't the best Disney live action movie but it is one of the better ones, no it doesn't reach the same heights as say beauty and the beast or Aladdin but it's a lot better than say lion king. The cast in this movie for example is amazing each member delivers a great performance but the man standout is Li gong who steals the show each time she is on screen. The music also is great yes there is no singing in the movie but the score is really good. The characters are also great yes there's the same characters but there is a couple new characters that were a welcome edition to the story. The story is also very unique because it's own thing and not a shot for shot remake of the animated Mulan. The action in this movie also is fantastic there was people running on walls flipping and stuff like that. Where the movie starts to fail Is with the changes, yes some worked but that's very little there was a constant feeling I had of something is missing. The movie also toward the end gets extremely cheesy and the ""realism"" factor gets thrown out the window. Overall, I did enjoy the live action Mulan, is it the best Disney live action movie no it's not but I didn't hate this movie like I expected to."
366,Loved this take on Mulan. I watched the animation when I was younger and loved her character as a women who knew how to fight and had a good heart! Watching this version with the beautiful art direction and storytelling with such a strong female lead was awesome. Being true to yourself - what a wonderful message for everyone young and old! Also the martial arts skills was next level.
367,"I kinda enjoyed this live action version of Mulan, action scenes were well directed, I really liked landscapes and costumes and I think that overall the story is entertaining and manages to keep you until the end. Compared to other live-action remakes, I think that this time Disney made overall a decent job, however there are a few things that really bugged me.Some iconic scenes were shorted or completely removed. A lot of key characters were missing. Everything was built around Mulan, that is the only hero. In the original movie Yao, Ling and Chien are essential for the development of the main character. Mushu that is one of the most memorable character in the Disney universe, was completely removed, to be replaced by a phoenix that does not even speak. I highly doubt that Disney did not have the money to create a CGI model. I was waiting for him for the whole movie, but unfortunately he never appeared. I don't expect an exact copy of the original 1998 cartoon, but these things were essential.The acting job of Yifei Liu should be better, there are some scenes where she is decent, but most of the time her interpretation is very flat. This problem extends also to the rest of the cast.I am very surprised that Disney with access to all this technology cannot create something nice and that almost every original movie is still better than these live action remakes. These movies are very good from a technical perspective, but from a narration point of view are awful. In my opinion this company should focus on creating new stories with new characters, leaving behind classics, that are already good."
368,"Just finished watching Mulan and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There's well-choreographed action, beautiful locales, strong performances and then some. It also has inspiring messages told in its less than 2-hour running time. I have not seen the animated film and I'm reviewing it as someone new to the character. I won't say too much except the film is a fun, exciting action drama that deserves to be seen for all the positives it has to offer. I didn't feel bored for even a second and had goosebumps in a few scenes. The stylish action choreography is indeed the film's highlight and hence those who've never heard of the character before, like me, can enjoy it just as a standalone action film without any connections to the animated one."
369,"Loved everything about Mulan! The script, the acting, the action, the messages, the scenery, the special effects. Fantastic!"
370,Just sit back in the comfort of your home and enjoy the excellent fight scenes and vibrant story line loved it!! Ignore all the other bad reviews
371,"I will return in glory,It was a powerful sentence.whether it is Mulan on the battlefield or the actor behind the scenes ,liuyifei she did it .She is our princess and a warrior"
372,"Beautiful , great acting, meaningful , a solid Disney movie. You get what you expect a great Disney movie for the family. So happy we get to see a bad ass Mulan."
373,"It was delightful to watch it, every detail in it is perfected.
Brilliant lead actress, and other actors too.
Enjoyed every second of the film. Highly recommend! :))"
374,"I don't usually stop from gaming when I watch a movie on my second monitor.
But this movie was quite good and I watched the ending twice.Now what I definitely don't understand who are all these salty butthurt reviewers giving it a 1/10 ???I don't know it their expectations were ruined or if its a cultural thing but in the worst of cases it would merit at least a 7.And it seems Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer of 74% agrees with me.ps: and fyi im a caucasian male ..."
375,"Mulan is one of Disney's best live action adaptations. This live action is the pulse of the gritty animated movie and is an epic delight, just as much as the animated classic and has its own entity. Mulan is an exciting, colourful and action packed live action vibrant movie, with amazing battles and a heroine with a ferocious heart. It is a soaring epic spectacle and an astonishing update to the animated classic that would have thrilled global audiences. It's too bad it won't be shared across big screens. Thank you Disney for bringing a fresh spin to a beloved classic tale."
376,"People are so silly! Just watch the movie for yourself... I think when the movie is free to watch, the ratings will go up.. so many people are mad they paid $30 and I don't think they're really taking the time to enjoy the movie! Yes it's a bit of a different storyline... noo there's no mushu and no there's no singing. But if you're surprised by that then you obviously haven't been paying attention! They told us that when the trailer first came out! Soooo your bad!
It was meant to be an action movie! And that's what it was! Personally, I enjoyed it!
Also The original mulan is one of my favorite movies! And this mulan is different but it's still very enjoyable! Like I said! Just watch the movie for yourself!"
377,"This is a fair review in my opinion. I did watch the original Mulan once. I do not have a large frame of reference. I'm reviewing this as a solo movie.1) Biggest issue I had was lack of character connection with the audience. I personally didn't have any connection to any character, wether small or big role. It was just folks acting in a movie. Not once did I feel emersed in the movie itself.2) Another lacking profile was the payoff at the end. This character Mulan goes through all the trials and tribulations. However it did not feel satisfying when she saved the country. The audience knew that was going to happen. So there was no enjoyment when it came to fruition.3) Lastly the action scenes were a mere joke. I'm not sure why certain Hollywood productions make time irrelevant. Mulan goes behind the opposition, creates an avalanche and yet some how beats the avalanche to meet up with her crew. I'm sorry things like that drive me crazy!All in all if you are to remake a kids movie, then make a kids movie. To bring this live action from a cartoon, at least try to make it a realistic live action movie."
378,"I think it is not so bad, I seriously liked colours and costume design. Especially visuals."
379,Did anyone notice that Mulans father looks exactly like Pooh Jin Pin!
380,Mulan is the movie I want to see most this year and I am so happy that I finally watched it. I think it is the best Disney live-action movies ever and I wish it had a second part.
381,The only good part if this movie is the fact Christina Aguilera recorded another good song.
382,"Originally planned to be one of 2020's biggest cinematic releases, the old foe we know as Covid-19 put a stop to Mulan's plans of taking over cinemas around the world, with the high-profile update of the classic Disney animation released now in a premium VOD format to allow fans a chance to finally see their beloved female heroine take flight in a live action world.Many wondered whether this release would detour from the spectacle and magic of the tale but all this worry was for naught as Niki Caro's charisma free and lifeless updating of the tale of young warrior Mulan and her undercover journey in the ranks of the army is so devoid of spark that you feel like little, if anything has been lost in its release from the big screen to the lounge-rooms of millions around the world.Quite clearly the result of significant financial investment and talented craftsmanship, Mulan looks the part of a family friendly fantasy epic but Caro and her behind the scenes creative team have lost any of the heart and soul of the original Disney offering along the way as the film ticks off a series of narrative progressions that are nothing more than markers that can be taken down at various points, as the films delivery and ideas are nothing better than generic at best.It's in many ways amazing that the film is so barren when it comes to any moments of memorability, Mulan herself who is played by the unfortunatly hamstrung Yifei Liu is in most scenes but can't make us care, the film lacks any significantly grandiose or well-staged spectacle despite its budget and the story itself is so by the numbers in its delivery that you will find yourself unwilling to conjure up any type of enthusiasm as you plod your way through the film as a viewer.Doing away with key elements of the animated film such as the song numbers, everyone's favorite talking dragon Mushu and the frequent humor that was a key component of the films initial success, this po-faced re-imaging wants badly to tap into the female hero oriented market that has made itself prevalent in recent years but you can't imagine any child, teenager or adult walking away from Mulan's journey here feeling inspired in any way shape or form.It's hard to pinpoint what went wrong with the film as an outside observer, even the appointment of Caro as the director seemed like a great pick after her form with similar female-oriented features like Whale Rider and North Country proving solid pieces of work, but there's little to recommend about this bland Disney offering that continues on Disney's so-so live action catalogue of films that have mostly failed to inspire much long lasting greatness.Final Say -An extremely by the numbers offering from Disney with fans of Mulan likely to be left cold by this films lifeless and charmless delivery, this epic film may look that part but it lacks severely in almost every angle imaginable.2 phoenixes out of 5"
383,"I wish I can say something good about this movie, but it's just so bad, not epic, bad effects, not funny, you can tell the actors were ok, but the direction is misleading."
384,"I'll start by admitting I never saw the animated version of Mulan. As a movie showing female empowerment its good, have nothing against the cast, the plot seems fine, its a Disney movie so you know how its going to end. Only wish is I could have seen it on the big screen. Far better than a lot of little children are saying."
385,"Inferior and emotionless but liked the performance by Donnie and Jet Li, the only good thing about me."
386,"In addition to the touching story and the wonderful performances of the actors, especially Mulan, the visual effects, fight design and war scenes are all online.Don't be deceived by malicious slander attacks.I love Mulan."
387,"The film has beautiful visuals and is well made. The story is a little westernised, made for a Western audience. If one is to ignore the historical and cultural inaccuracies, it is quite an enjoyable film."
388,"I would even advise everyone not to watch it, but just please don't financially support it because it just isn't worth your money.
I was really looking for a reason to give this movie 2 stars but the only good thing I could find about it was like 5 shots I thought looked nice, but i don't feel like that validates a higer rating.Outside those few beautiful shots, there is nothing of quality in here. Even the acting wasn't good. There is not a single good written character, plot makes absolutely no sense, everything feels forced and emotionally detached. This movie is just frustratingly unenjoyable to watch an I don't understand why does it have to exist. I am genuinely disappointed.That extremely profit drvien attitude towards creating something to the point where you no longer care about the quality of it as long as it makes tons of money can really be felt in this movie and it is such a shame. I never thought I would have to give something the lowest rating but this is just terrible. Such a shame..."
389,"This movie is beautiful and it made me cry!!!
95% of these reviews are just trolls because
the movie went to Disney+ and not theaters Cry babiesThis movie is amazing one of the best live action remakes of Disney!
It may not have music and mushu but the movie and story are beautiful
The actress maybe dumb but her potrayal of Mulan is beautiful and inspiring.This is my first time doing a review but this one really deserves the love
See it for yourself! Don't judge the movie by their actressThis movie is a must watch I can watch it all day the ending is just so BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECTTT"
390,"Forget the animation one, this is a mature version of the film. The cinematography and action is great. Just enjoy the movie!"
391,Spoilers are there to spoil don't believe those all it is one of my favourite movie from my favourite Disney Studios... Just watch the movie and ENJOY...
392,"If you like Chinese martial arts movie you'll probably like this one too. Without much fighting or special effects and, unfortunately, not even the Disney magic feeling."
393,Powerful Movie about giving courage to girls who will someday grow to be the most courageous warrior.
394,"A quality martial arts film with mysticism elements, much in the trend of many modern heavy SFX films of it's type.
It's not bloodthirsty, nor is it hollow. Don't expect great depth in character relations; it's a martial arts, heavy action film. So personally, I am glad it focused on that.
Far from a dull watch, nor carried by big named actors."
395,I loved the 1998-Mulan and really looked forward to this movie after seeing the trailer. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed with a movie.The 1998-Mulan was about a normal woman who took her fathers place in the army because she loves him. Through hard work she becomes a skilled soldier and through her quick thinking she ends up saving China.In this movie she seems to be some unique one in a million woman who is awesome at fighting without much training. This is just so disappointing in itself. Furthermore it feels like the primary reason for taking her fathers place is some sort of self-realization. And then there's the underdeveloped and forced relations that just doesn't feel natural at all. Even most of the battle scenes ended up annoying me with their whole ignore gravity thing going on.
396,"At over twice the cost of an average cinema ticket, and that on top of a monthly subscription, Disney are really taking us for a ride. Rubbish film, too."
397,Congratulations Disney... Everything that made the original animation a great movie was gone.At least the supreme leader is happy I guess.
398,"Bad director, they should have at least gone with an Asian director who had some more idea about Mulan. The magic stuff is nonsense. It could have been a great movie with great actors already but maybe the director and script writers were too high on something. Very corny scenes. Just a silly adaptation of Mulan ."
399,"A boring and souless remake. Poor, wooden acting, awkward dialogues, and awful editing. Nothing remains from original movie - no character development, no humour, no fantasy characters, no songs.Political correct brigade have completely ruined this movie."
400,"The original mulan was funny, different, original, but most important, full of important lessons, for everyone, but specially for females. The writers for the new mulan erased all those ideas that a ORDINARY person can rise above.... noooo, this mulan only triumphs because she has a ""secret power"".... also, not funny, not fun period. I was very disappointed, but that's on me, my expectations were to high I guess."
401,"The essential problem with Mulan is that women only have value if they become men. She has extraordinary power, more so in this than in the cartoon version, and she could use it to not be trapped in stupid men's games. The war is dumb and boring. If she and Xian Lang had teamed up and had freed themselves of the men to give land back to the Nomads, give women more freedom and end the war, it wouldn't be a stupid war movie.
The Uber male direction made it just a dumb war movie."
402,"I honestly do not know what the hell people are talking about.
The new Mulan is brilliant.
It's a solid 8 and I would watch it again.
I used to love the old classics such as The Water Margin and this did those stories honour.
Absolutely brilliant film and better than the original (which I watched a few months ago) also a nice cameo from the original voice of Mulan at the end"
403,"You must keep an open mind, watch it without thinking of the animation Mulan and you will love this film. Great story telling, great characters and beautiful ending. I don't think that the people who gave a low score really understand the movie. Just watch it. You won't regret it."
404,"You want a family movie ?
This is it.
Score was great,and if you want to enjoy a movie this weekend ..go for it."
405,"Never mind the primary donnas - thus is visually sumptuous movie, blending modern style with a good script and great choreography and acting. It is an entertains story where good old-fashioned values prevail and only the most cynical viewer will fail to ""feel good"" after watching Mulan."
406,"Mulan was a great movie, and I knew it was very difficult to achieve the same again, so I just expected an entertaining action film. Nevertheless, I am very disappointed.Mulan used to be one of the most relatable characters because she was not born powerful or skilled, but actually worked to protect her family and her country. I don't understand why they could not keep such an essential characteristic.Of course, there are many more changes that you may dislike more or less, including the removal of all funny characters and songs, but none equals how they ruined my girl."
407,"As a native Chinese, the biggest issue I have is the bad writing. Many dialogs are poorly written culture-wise from both Western/American point of view or Asian/Chinese point of view. I can get past the predictable plot since it's a live-action remake, but the story is very inadequately executed and several plot-points are absurd and ridiculous. Many times I found myself asking -- ""Huh? Why would they do that!"" Moreover, even though it's marketed as an ""Action"" movie, the movie is also lacking any impressive action sequences which could have made it more entertaining. Battle scenes feel small, and many open-field sets feel confined and cramped. I was expecting LOTR or Avenger level battles but instead, I got a couple of dozen people doing some badly designed and executed martial arts in an enclosed movie set. Don't get me wrong, you have a group of very well trained martial arts actors (Donnie Yen, Jet Li, Jason Scott Lee), but feels like someone from a kungfu store in a strip-mall came up with the fighting sequences. Hell, The Matrix has better fighting scenes than this. Overall, the star-packed Mulan is an Action-Drama lack of both. What a shame!"
408,"I love the original animated movie since my childhood and I decided to give a shot. I wish I wouldn't. The acting and plot is terrible, the visuals are ""meh"", and they got NO MUSHU! The movie has no humor, no decent plot or anything that keeps you watching. I can't believe what I just watched, or should I say ""got through""? It's just another boring, cash-grab remake by Disney. Just like The Lion King."
409,"Literally everything good about the original is taken out of this remake leaving nothing more than a hollow shell of a movie about a Mary Sue who is the perfect fighter despite zero training and no character development. So many cringe worthy moments, stiff acting, and bad dialogue."
410,Watch it with my fam. Now I'm proud of mulan and kids love her too. It's a pity that we can't watch it on big screen
411,"I don't care what anyone says but i really liked the movie. There were a few noticeable flaws In the dialogue, story and action, but even with them i still enjoyed it and to me Yifei Liu was an amazing Mulan"
412,"Any of these new animated live action, whatever movies you guys make, I'm going to give it a one star until there's music. SINGING DISNEY SIGNING"
413,"At first I didn't knew why the viewer ratings were so low, so I was curious to see this movie for myself. Then I discovered that most user ratings were politically motivated, and nothing but anti-china bots, with nonsensical reasons to make this movie look bad. In that regard they failed their purpose, because its free publicity and it made me actually wanting to see the movie even more.After watching the movie myself, I can truly say it was beautifully made! The movie had good build up, majestically filmed. Yifei as Mulan was charismatic and her charms added depth to the character Mulan. She sometimes speaks volumes without saying anything, and when she does say something its meaningful, those are rare qualities of an actor.At times it gave me goosebumps to finally see a live action version of Mulan, I have to admit I had to wipe some occasional tears away throughout the movie.Mulans companions were funny and their camaraderie was heartfelt.Fun fact: Honghui was historically the love interest of Mulan, not Shang Li from the animated movie ;-)Even though without the musical songs that made the animated version popular, but there were enough references to the animation throughout the movie that made it satisfying watch and did honor to the animated version.All the actors were great and solid, especially the father played by Tzi Ma was convincing as a caring and inspirational father to Mulan in such a short timespan of character development.Sad fact: Historically Mulan fought a war campaign of 12 years. She never did get to see her father again, because when she got home her father already died of old age. Traumatized by warfare, Mulan never became her old self, she got depressed and committed suicide, hoping she could reunite with her father in the afterlife being that carefree loving daughter again....The encounter with the Witch (Xianniang) played by Gong Li was superbly done. I think the witch might even have been a metaphor for Mulans inner fears. It was so poetically well executed.I am glad Jetli got to do some of his last few action sequences, as Jetli is suffering from returning illnesses, the reason why he doesn't do much action nowadays.Bori Khans character is the equivalent of Shan Yu in the animated version, and is in the live action more fleshed out as to what his motivations were for attacking the kingdom, that was a nice touch.Also nice references to chinese Wuxia genre, where lifeforce and chi are prominent for martial art masters.For the people that missed Mushu, there is a reference of a phoenix though that helped Mulan, and in chinese folklore phoenix represents a woman.I recommend this movie highly for the fans of the original animation and for people who are new to the story of Mulan.For me it was a well worthy tribute to both the legendary chinese folklore story Mulan aswell as the original disney animated version!"
414,"My first impression of this film came from walking in to my living room to see my roommate watching it. I stood there for a good 15 minutes trying to figure out what he was watching before I gave up and just asked him. When he told me the title it did not bode well as I had been planning on watching the new Mulan myself later.
Though I was hesitant I did watch the whole film from start to finish. It was everything I had worried about after that fifteen minutes. Calling this film a ""remake"" is simply inaccurate. It's unrecognizable as Disney's Mulan. The story has been drastically changed and key characters from the original animated film are nowhere to be seen. Moreover, this film lacks the charm of the animated film, taking a more serious approach that falls flat due to poor acting and bad special effects.
I'm not sure who this is a film for, but one thing is certain: if you enjoyed Disney's original animated Mulan then this isn't the film for you."
415,"Mulan is a mixed bag that does try to do something fresh rather than be a shot for shot remake but forgets what made Mulan and her character arc so good in the process. Yifei Liu gives a good lead performance and Donnie Yen and Li Gong both give good supporting performances, the villiain however is extremely forgettable. The film looks gorgeous but the CG is inconsistent. It's mostly well filmed but the action sequences are choppy, bloodless and weightless. The music by Harry Gregson-Williams is really good but could have implemented the originals music a little more."
416,"Cinematography was nice, credits music was really good! A few decent easter eggs in the dialogue and at least the cast wasn't whitewashed. That's where the pros end for me.Songs or no songs, the story shed all the lovable, fun moments the animated movie had. It was a serious, somber film where important, deep topics were sort of just presented rather than revealed through character and plot development. Mulan's character wasn't as relatable because of this. While the animated version had her be a normal person who worked extra hard, struggled like heck, and use her mind to overcome challenges, much of the live-action Mulan's skills was just chalked up to her innate chi. [Why? Who even knows? Sounds of exasperation].I do not think the actors are bad but the movie seemed to be lacking emotional depth on some choices (for example, the quickness at which the army accepted Mulan being revealed or the witch's change of heart seemed rushed). But this may be due to the director's questionable choices...other questionable choices include: excluding the highly popular comic relief, Mushu, and having a phoenix guide instead, leaving out Mulan's turning point in the army (y'all remember the epic scene during I'll make a man out of you where Mulan climbs that tall post with heavy medallions around her wrist to retrieve that arrow?), making the lucky cricket a random soldier named Cricket, a sister who is scared of spiders (quite possibly to only cause the bug uproar at the matchmaker's), and no cray, slightly thirsty, but super lovable grandmother?Not much more to say. Just going to have to rewatch the animated version again."
417,"I suggest you don't watch so you don't ruin the original movie. First off, you won't enjoy unless you're ""woke"". Second, no original characters, and just bland acting. If you like action, it's good for that but if you want any substance; don't waste your money."
418,I just finished watching this and I've got to say it didn't disappoint! I understand it was due to be released in the cinema but given the current situation with coronavirus I was so happy to learn you can purchase it on Disney+ I thought the film was absolutely amazing and by far the best live action remake Disney has done so far!
419,"I loved this retelling of Mulan. I loved the acting, the story, the cinematography and I loved how much heart and soul there is."
420,"I don't give a damn about what any online parent or critic says about this film. It was done with such integrity to the overall storyline.No, there are not talking dragons and what not - so if you're going on here to rant about what it lacks.. watch the cartoon.To me, it's a HUGE nod to old Martial Art/Kung Fu flicks in several ways. Actors, scenes, locations, the overall aesthetics were absolutely amazing."
421,No need to compare it to whether they did the new Mulan just like they did the animated one Like all the negative reviewers are saying. This was just a great movie all on it's own. Watch it as it's own story and enjoy it. It was excellent.
422,"Loving her performance. She is more than just awesome.
I am not a fan of her but this is the first time I can sit down and enjoy a movie from her."
423,"First, get the animation out of your head! I love the animation just as much as the next one but, this VERSION of her story helps to shape our women and young girls. It's a great tribute to anyone who is trying to be true to themselves while hearing naysayers tell them they can not. I absolutely loved how the story was told! I'm trying not to give spoilers. Just give it a chance and put yourself in Mulan's position.I AM MULAN!"
424,"I love Mulan, there may be countless magnolias in real life. She's like a miniature of life, and I hope everyone can see Mulan, the real female power"
425,Liu YiFei did a great job in this movie. Love this movie very much.
426,"...me neither. Too long agoI really enjoyed this wholesome family entertainment movie. Core family lessons, humor, gorgeous sceneryAfter reading so many of the puzzling negative reviews, I started seeing a pattern in them that leaves me with no doubt that there was an organized effort by several authors with multiple accounts that wanted to attack this movie.This is definitely one to watch and make up your own mind if it's good."
427,"Lost all the character, message, and charm of the original.The soundtrack was one of the WORST aspects of this movie, second only to its action sequences.Disney missed the mark in a painfully cringey and disappointing way. If I could give 0 stars, I would."
428,"The beauty of the main actress isn't enough to carry a whole movie - such a legendary movie.The hints to the theme songs are misplaced and unnecessary, if this version doesn't have the songs we all loved.No fun, no wits, no soul, in this movie. I had to re-watch the original cartoon after it finished - it left me unfulfilled... like it stole something from me."
429,But kind of slow at times. Not as good without Eddie Murphy. And the word is Disney and the CCP killed more Uighurs making this movie than Cecil B DeMille.
430,"The movie isn't as funny as the original was. I loved the original songs and the musical to sing together along the movie and the funny scenes. Disney took all of that out and replaced it with characters that lack depth, light action bloodless battle scenes and a forced female empowerment. This summed with the polemic points with the actress and minority repression made me disgust.Sorry Disney, I loved your other movies and I had a high expectation for this one and was disappointed."
431,Such a bad movie. It's like watching a completely different story. Different story. Not suggesting.Where is MUSHU ???? 😂
432,"The only true emotion I could feel throughout the movie is sadness for all the great artists involved in the world building of the movie. The makeup, costumes, art and scenery was amazing. It is a shame it really fell short to achieve a coherent and well paced story. The directing was terrible, the editing felt rushed, the performance of most actors was lame (except from the lead, she was great), and overall the story felt soulless. If you want to really honor a culture and female power, just do a great movie."
433,"It's odd that Disney would make a more realistic take on Mulan (which it wasn't completely) and replace it with a serious film that isn't accurate to the legend either.If you're expecting Mushu, you won't see him. If you're expecting ""I'll make a man out of you"", you won't hear it. I felt no spark with any character including Mulan herself, it's possibly because of the wooden acting and forced dialogue. She is extra powerful despite not learning any stunts because of this ""chi"" nonsense.The best thing I can say about this movie, is that it has some cool action sequences and cinematography but that's pretty much it. The end credits has a decent song.I'm getting quite exhausted with these Disney remakes and the senseless cash grab despite Disney being filthy rich. I think it's best if they stick with something more original or just animated movies."
434,Rarely have I seen such plot delirium. In the whole movie there was not a single minute where anything would surprise you.
435,"Original I want to give 8 or 9 out of 10. The movie is great but not perfect. However, some people rates low only for the political reason, ridiculous."
436,"A true live-action re-telling of the Disney Classic. Far better than I had expected. I didn't watch it for a verbatim copy of the original. Truth is, I watched it because my wife wanted to see it. We absolutely loved it! Hands down, THE most beautiful film of the year. Cinematography, set design, photography, choreography, costume design, art department, wardrobe; all of it, A-mazing! If you want a 100% copy of the original- this ain't it. But what it IS, is a beautifully filmed, well-acted movie, that tells the story of Mulan. It is a feast for the eyes! Empowering messages aside (there are plenty), this movie shows that what a girl probably wants more than anything, is a proud father and a hug from her dad. Watch it yourself- don't listen to some clown who writes on this site every week, and thinks a movie critique is about finding flaws and things to dislike about movies, whilst bolstering their review with a Thesaurus. It's just plain fun; at least, my family thought so."
437,"Don't trust the bad reviews and watch this. It's actually a pretty good adaptation of the historic story of Mulan. I was skeptical about watching, especially Moshu was not part of the movie, but there was no room for Moshu here. It's a great movie just as it is, without the westernized addition. It shows a great power and respect to women too, so well done!"
438,"Obviously being live action it's hard to be exactly like the animation. The story is near the same but there a quite a few differences. But the overall plot is the same as the original. The costumes, action, acting, music and cinematography are typical Disney top notch. Really enjoyed watching this. One of my favourite Disney remakes of the recent batch. Particularly liked the martial arts in this film. Really cool."
439,"This is a wonderful Disney Princess movie! The reason why Hua Mulan, created by this movie, joined the army for his father is not only to fulfill filial piety, but also to seek her own value, in order to win the victory of her soul in the society that oppresses and binds women."
440,"The vivid colour and sweeping imagery set the film above and apart from the usual Disney offering. The characters are simply drawn and the plot was never going to be more than a sketch, but there is humour, subtleties and references that that kept it interesting till the end.As simple as an adventure or as complex as a Father/Daughter tale of honour, the film is worth the money to watch it."
441,"Inspiring and totally blow-minding!!!
I absolutely recommend it!
Worth to watch it again ansd again!"
442,"The cast are great, the movie was shoot beautifully, and mostly follow the original storyline, and some adjustment to make it logical.Very enjoyable to watch, the lead actress is amazing for Mulan.The soundtrack is amazing, especially the two song performed by Christina Aguilera."
443,"Wonderful! The best live-action princess movie ever made by Disney! Liu Yifei's performance surprised me. There is a wonderful beauty in her. She is Mulan herself in the movie. Of course, the film weakens Mulan's character to a certain extent, and the plot in the second half of the film is too tight. I think it would be more appropriate for the movie to have an extra fifteen minutes to describe the plot behind it."
444,"Mulan is a role model for girls.She gave me strength and courage.To be loyal, brave and true."
445,It is a beautiful movie. The story is excellent. It is not a comedy with a talking dragon. There are battle scenes and there are fantasy scenes. Mulan is a great role model.
446,I'm getting sick of Disney live action remakes to original classic movies just leave it alone why did you ruin Mulan as I agree with reviews in section it's a boring cheesy marital arts movie Mulan who didn't get any character development because she was already strong from beginning. The Phoenix is in fact the useless animal in the movie that did nothing appear in few scenes. You take off hair cutting scene why? Then put this cheesy villain on it's a mess of a movie. You completely butchered the original movie.My advice don't waste your money or your time on this mess of film your better off watching animated Mulan.
447,"I loved the story of mulan as a child. It is about overcoming your fear and physical limitations because of love. Not brute force or strength but using your brain is the key.This Movie is about alllllmighty Mary Sue, i mean Rey... I mean sorry, got that mixed up: Mulan being a chi powered superhero, without any weaknesses... no training required! No friends required. She alone is perfect.Her father is very much interested in the concept of her bringing honour to the family ... and not in Mulan herself.It got some good action sequences but the plot is missing... seems the Mouse did not get what this movie is all about.Would not pay a dime to watch it, watch the animated movie again or the mulan live action from a few years back ... don't waste your time!"
448,"Cringey dialogues, bad script, awful directing, poor acting. The film looks and sounds like a film made in China or Taiwan. Only the score and some parts of cinematography are good. I also liked the exchange: ""Beautiful sword. Yes, a beautiful tool to do horrible work."""
449,"The movie was not what I was expecting. It had no feeling, no suspense, no epic moments, not good music. I felt like it was poorly executed, with bad cut scenes and most of all no feeling at all.
When you see it it's like a Kids movie with plot holes too bright colours no suspense and not building characters.
If you have seen the animation movie prepare to be very disappointed. Most of the epic scenes are not there, there is no drake guard instead there is a Phoenix made with bad Cgi that looks like a kite.
It is not epic, not funny, with no suspense it lacks all the things that made the animation one of the best of all times."
450,"It''s really so sad that they took all that i loved about this movie and smashed it against the wall! My wife and i watched it yesterday, just embarrassing for disney!
An absolutely NO"
451,The director doesn't know Chinese culture and history at alll.
452,"I disagree with the approach of all the people comparing it to the original so instead I'm rating it for the movie it is on its own. While they did ok with the plot, it fails to keep you invested from beginning to end for some reason... it is missing a lot of ""heart"" that is usually expected from Disney movies. Also they wanted to make it a Chinese style action movie but adopted the typical Hollywood type of editing for all fight scenes and the result is subpar. The great acting makes up for it but overall it is just mildly entertaining."
453,"Okay, so you go from the amazing 1998 mulan movie, to this movie about a already super combat ready mulan who also has come powers and other people also have powers!Some of the time the voices seem like they were dubbed over and badlyAnd some of the effects are really bad!Oh and the main actress supporters nazi china taking over hong kong!Please do not watch this movie, i regret even knowing it existed!"
454,"I waited for this movie for so long. I thought it will bring something special. It was disappointingly stupid: acting, script, storyline and so on. Sorry ..."
455,I'd been looking forward to this movie for over a year--even AFTER I found out there was no dragon. Not worth $30 on top of my monthly subscription. Not even worth 30 cents. So so sad.
456,"It's not a bad movie. But it's also not a good one.Too much pandering to China.The original Mulan is superior to this ""realistic"" re-imagining."
457,"As a spanish, married to a chinese, fluent chinese speaker and 15 years in China, I have to say that I regret this movie was not filmed by Zhang Yimo. I wouldn't have wasted one and a half precious hour of my life by watching such terrible special effects, average acting, increasingly boring script and the WORST ending in the history of Disney movies.there was only a couple of scenes in the movie worth of Disney, the rest it was painful to watch."
458,"Honestly this could of been the hidden 8th kingdom in The Game of Throne saga. With Mulan sitting at the throne at the end. Best movie so far this year. I'm new to this story. I didn't see the animation version. I have a 55"" tv with a sound bar. Almost felt like I was in a cinema. Way to go Disney. Black is King and Mulan in the same year. These are timeless classics. Keep up your cut above the rest entertainment projects. I will be watching again this weekend"
459,"You already watched this movie . knew how bad it is .why giving 10 or 8 stars .
Those peoples need to know if any movie have andscapes and virtual effects doesn't mean it will definitely good.
Just it ."
460,"The parts I like:
The beginning. I liked how they showed Mulan as a child.. it gave background. I like the ending song. The visuals. It looks nice.So everything else..oh god. Some people are applauding the acting but the only thing I see is robotic expression. The delivery of the lines feel too mechanical. The part where they were discussing what is their ideal women was laughable. They tried so hard to show casual..ness but it failed for me. What even were those lines. The lyrical lines doesn't fit at all.They butchered the mountain scene too. Nobody saw Mulan's sacrifice. You can't even feel the rush when the snow fell. It looked good but there was no anxiety for it. I mean Mulan's horse is literally just running in the avalanche like it was normal ground. I didn't once feel any stress. She doesn't even looked stressed at all!They just pushed so much ""Mulan the feminist"" like adding weird details. Like the scene where she reveals herself as a woman and asks to be executed or with the ending where the guard says the emperor is waiting for her to choose what she wants to do.I guess the music was also bad because it didn't help carry the tones to guide the vibe of the scene especially with fight scenes. It was just bland fighting scenes.There's a lot of wrongs that happened. Overall I can say that this is just a pretentious movie. They told us they opted to divert from the Disney animated version to make it more Original.. represent the Chinese culture and yet it's not. I have watched the 2009 Live action Mulan and I cried. I felt that movie more than this 2020. I felt the grittiness and the REALNESS the 2020 was supposedly going for. This 2020 version is lacking. There's no Disney magic. There's no real vibe. It's just in between. Like a dream"
461,None of the original songs from the original movie are in this. What a disaster and a complete disappointment.
462,No music/story line awful/it's awful continue watching this movie with your friends
463,What are they doing? What are they doing? What are they doing?
464,"It is a beautiful movie that wants to share something meaningful, to show the virtues of a warrior, of a woman. It is a nice, not accurate, but beautiful movie telling the story of the Legend Hua Mulan. I had seen the disney animated movie Mulan when I was little, which I liked a lot and this was a nice reminder!"
465,"From Niki Caro (the director of Whale Rider) we have another inspiring story about the power of a woman who refuses to be shoved into the wrong box by society.
Because this is a bit more mature than Disney's animation, we also have another character played by Gong Li who seems to represent the more traditional way women in ancient history were able to maintain power. Gong Li has been cast in similar hypnotically tragic roles in Memoirs of a Geisha and Raise the Red Lantern. Ming-Na Wen, who voiced the animated Mulan has a cool cameo! And of course it was also great fun to see martial arts action stars Donnie Yen, Jet Li and Jason Scott Lee. No Eddie Murphy though. I think I was also seeing the colorful cinematography paying homages to movies by Zhang Yimou and the Shaw Brothers.
Being kind of a slow year for new movies, this one is extra easy to appreciate for me."
466,Everything is incomplete with story. Pointless end.
467,Just cant believe that in 2020 movie like this still can be made on screen and it was made by Disney.
468,"Disney trying to push its subscription service and charging 35$CDN for digital copy for this trashcan of a film is farcical at best. If this was the best they could offer as original streaming content why would anyone bother? And with theatres closing due to Covid I can't imagine how they intend to survive as a steaming service with garbage content like this. Watch the Mulan: Rise of the Warrior (a.k.a. Hua Mulan) starring Zhao Wei instead, it's a beautiful version of the story and a Chinese classic."
469,To put it simply they turned an amazing and memorable movie into another generic action filmIt was a good movie but it wasn't Mulan
470,"Save your time and your money!!! This version was painfully boring, dry and nothing like the original. I'm really disappointed in Disney.. There was a lot of potential to make this an amazing movie."
471,This movie attempted to through every famous asian actor it could to try to hide how poorly this was written and directed but it completely failed to do so. the movie doesn't introduce any of the characters so you have no idea who's who unless you watched the original animated movie. the first scene where kid mulan is jumping around was so badly written and directed it set the tone for how bad the movie would be. the entire movie is set to an absurd pace that that it doesn't help build any emotion or connection to the movie. this movie is void of all the magic that the original had. no music nor comedy. i would not recommend this movie. everything disney outside the marvel movies is lost right now. just terrible
472,"As a remake this movie ruined the animation and its a bad remake.so many things changed and I'm sure many people don't like the changes like i do. when a company tries to remake an animation into live-action movie must consider the elements and details that the people loved it in the first place.disney ruined mulan, the lion king, and so many animation for me by changes in remakes. especially when you have high hopes on the remake"
473,"Warning: Does contain spoilersHonestly if I could give this movie a 0 rating I would, when I heard that a Mulan movie was being made I thought I would get dazzaled by nostalgia, but instead I was left with more regret than content. Firstly not a single song that was in the original was in the movie...not one and I was really hoping I would hear ""be a man"" I was ready to sing along to the music but non. That's not a major part of the film but brought about a certain sense of connection with the characters, but I digress no music.Secondly, and I can't put the blame entirely on the production team but Mulan's village looked completely different, when I say completely I mean like a whole new village entirely, no small river, no cherry blossoms and no grass, I mean come on, did the writers not watch the original at all.I would also like to point out the removal and addition of certain characters, Mulan's grandmother is missing, cri-kee is missing, Mushu isn't Mushu he's a fricken bird, and what happened to Li Shang??? I mean he became Mulan's husband, I digress many characters went missing, hence certain aspects of the movie just didn't feel right. And another thing who the hell is that shape shifting eagle I mean,Fourthly, many of the scenes did not take place or were not acted correctly, I found myself lost for words at how bad some of the scenes were reenacted, the army training, I know normal people won't be able to climb up a vertical log but come on man climbing up a mountain with buckets in hand is that the best you can do. The fight scene on the mountain"
474,"This movie is nothing like Mulan. I wish I could give this a score lower than one. This is by far the worst live actions ever, and live actions usually suck."
475,"This is easily the worst movie I've seen in the last decade. I don't understand how the makers of this movie could watch it back and be happy with releasing this travesty. I can't get these two hours of my life back, thanks for nothing disney."
476,"I know it's not supposed to be identical to the 1998 animated movie... but this... this was NOT mulan. she was not that clumsy girl who BECAME a warrior... yup... BECAME, not 'already a warrior deep inside'!!!
I missed the litte magic in the movie! And to be honest...I didn't watch it until the end."
477,"Its like the director and writers didn't even bother to watch any of the mulan movies and decided to improvise everything and cut important key moments that happened in the animated Mulan (like mulan cutting her hair to join the army). They completely removed everything that made Mulan, Mulan."
478,Exit The Dragon. This movie Is nothing but time waste. Poor piece of acting specifically the main actress.. so much overacting 🤢
479,"No surprise that this embarrassment is not shown in movie theatres... It's pure money laundry movie. As bare in mind, they spend 200 million for something in there. Good luck understanding for what?!
Also, how Disney is involved in this? Are they listed only as rights owners or??? There's no feel of this being a Disney movie. There's not Disney style to it."
480,"I found the movie pretty boring and the writing was lazy compared to the original. I was definitely missing Mushu and grandmother for comedic relief. I was even a little annoyed that they changed her name. I didn't understand why the witch used magic but Mulan didn't have her spirit guide, why even mention the spirits if they weren't gonna use them. And I feel like everything was too easy for her, she had no progress, they made her a naturally talented flying warrior. And they had a lot of long pauses with dramatic imagery and I felt they could have used those moments to actually add depth to the characters. It was filmed beautifully and the costumes were great but that's it. The original Mulan is way better."
481,Somebody teaches her how to act please! I cannot understand why she was casted to Mulan although her acting was so bad. I could not see any of her character's expression during the movie. She kept only one expression in almost every scene which was emotionless. I hope next time Disney should hire an actress who really know how to act during a live-action movie. Please don't ruin my favorite movie again.
482,"Not worth a second watch. It was corny and boring. I can still vividly remember the funny scenes in the cartoon version. But this version was too serious and boring. And what's up with Phoenix bird. With all the publicity and anticipation, it was really a big disappointment."
483,"Wow...this was barely watchable. Turning Mulan into a ""movie"" was a wasted effort of time and a boatload of money. Disney has once again failed to delight customers by turning beloved animation into a barely watchable live-action movie in an effort to cash in on past laurels. Please Stop Remaking Animation into Live-Action."
484,"I just don't know how you can stray so far from what was truly amazing about the Original when the Original is right there to watch abd is so beloved.
A random Disney Fan who grew up on the Golden Era of Disney could have put together a more faithful screenplay. The Whale Rider Director is Pretentious in the ""Vision"" they had for this Film in taking away the music and main characters for more ""Realism""
They could have had the best of both just like with what Golden Era Disney did already, and is Unprecedented for. Comedy, Unbelievable Action, Music that means so much to so many. Reflections was so iconic, and for people who didn't feel a connection to the person they see in the mirror is so relevant today. This movie could have been truly Empowering, but instead it's just ""Woke""
This movie decided to take everything away from what made Mulan what it was and didn't build on it at all either. Took away the Heart & Soul of what makes Disney special. Please don't ruin the Hercules remake like this Russo bros! Take note of the reviews. This is not what we want. So disappointing when Mulan is your favorite Disney Film and I'm sure others are really upset as well. I mean imagine if they had remade The Lion King, but took away all the music. Just saddening."
485,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)As you might now, this remake is one of my most anticipated movies of 2020 (list here). I've at least ""liked"" almost every remake Disney has delivered so far, so I was incredibly excited that 1998's Mulan was getting the same treatment. Niki Caro made it clear this would be an entirely different version of the story we all know and love. A more realistic take on the Chinese tale, one that removes all songs and fan-favorite characters like Mushu, which instantly impacted expectations, varying tremendously from person to person. People who would love a remake quite similar to the original will enter the film already slightly discouraged. However, to everyone who complained about Disney copying their original IP, Mulan might be their best chance to like a remake from the studio.In my opinion, a remake should have a bit of both. It must keep the original's essence and message while delivering something that distinguishes it from the former. Any remake must always prove the reasons behind its existence. It must have something that makes the viewers think: ""I like this part that's not in the original"". Aladdin has a new arc given to Jasmine. Beauty and the Beast provides Beast with a better-developed storyline. Even The Lion King, a remake that convinced many people to call it a shot-for-shot (it isn't), presents a groundbreaking visual experience that's incomparable to the original. Therefore, I was genuinely hyped for Mulan and what Niki Caro could bring with her more pragmatic cut...I can't deny it: I feel extremely disappointed. In my review of the original movie, I mention how epic and cinematic it feels. It was one of the aspects I looked forward to the most in this new version. Despite the beautiful set design and some painting-like shots, this is the first time a Disney's live-action remake loses to its original regarding its visuals. The 2D animation from more than twenty years ago feels superior in every single aspect. There's only one shot in the entire remake that I would put in the original, and I bet it would look and feel a lot more emotionally significant. The action sequences are unimaginative and incredibly disjointed. Except for a few great war moments, most action scenes are packed with excessive CGI, a badly employed HFR (high frame rate), and overediting.In fact, the editing (David Coulson) is weirdly overworked throughout the entire runtime, cutting too much and omitting sequences that were supposed to significantly impact the narrative. From character-defining moments to simple connections between scenes, it feels like the film is hiding something. I constantly needed to rely on my knowledge of the original to remember why certain moments are meaningful to a character or to the story itself because this remake straight-up removes these moments without replacing them with something else. Even in chronological terms, it's clumsily put together, jumping from location to location without actually showing the characters moving from one place to another.Finally, as my last remark on the technical aspects, Harry Gregson-Williams' score is partially also a letdown. Like the rest of the movie, there are some nice touches and lovely homages to the songs everyone cherishes, especially Reflection. I had already mentalized myself to ignore the absence of songs because I believed Harry would find a way to replace them with a similarly grand score that I would definitely enjoy. However, Mulan's score fails not only to elevate a single battle sequence but also to deliver that cinematic atmosphere that I was looking forward to so much. I didn't get chills during the entire film. It didn't transform any big character moments. Maybe watching it on IMAX instead of at home might improve my opinion, but I doubt that.Story-wise, it's a mixed bag for me. Niki Caro promised a more realistic take, totally different from the original, and she undoubtedly accomplished that. This is the furthest from the original any Disney remake has been, by far. From the replacement of characters to an overall change to the main narrative, Mulan is more faithful to the original Chinese tale than the 1998's flick, but that doesn't mean it's better, much on the contrary. The essence and message are there but told through a distinct perspective, which some people will find hard to accept, especially hardcore fans of the original movie. However, I do believe that Hua Mulan still carries the characteristics that made me care about her.Her courage and bravery to go to war in order to save her father from certain death. Her love and devotion to her family, who she wants to honor. Hua Mulan doesn't want to just be the wife of some random man nor be imprisoned by dated stereotypes. This is all in the remake but told through the lenses of a protagonist who already has everything she needs to lead a nation. This is the main difference character-wise, but one that doesn't affect the nature of the original. However, it impacts the remake itself. While all of this sounds amazing, Mulan sort of contradicts itself by making her main character feel unique and different from everyone else, distancing her more from people than actually embracing her.Like I already mentioned above, this is an entirely altered version of the story everyone knows. I do welcome every change made, including the removal of Mushu, Cri-Kee, and all of the singing. However, if something's removed, something else has to replace it in some shape or form. Once again, I have mixed feelings. Some additions, like the introduction of Chi and the witch Xian Lang (Gong Li), are refreshing but poorly developed throughout the runtime. The vital energy force is connected to my issue with the ""be yourself"" message, while the character not only follows a predictable arc, but it diminishes Bori Khan's (Jason Scott Lee) menacing presence.The ending feels remarkably underwhelming as well. Not only the climactic fight between Hua Mulan and Bori Khan fails to live up to expectations, but it's executed in a visually disheartening fashion. I expected this remake to feel grand, magnificent, epic, and cinematic, just like its original or even better. It's far from that. The acting could also be better. Liu Yifei is fantastic as Hua Mulan, Yoson An offers a subtle yet efficient interpretation of Chen Honghui, and the actors who portray Yao (Chen Tang), Ling (Jimmy Wong), and Chien-Po (Doua Moua) are also amusing. However, Donnie Yeng as Commander Tung and Jet Li as The Emperor are embarrassingly bland, while Jason Scott Lee is visually perfect casting as the main villain, but he's not able to shine.In the end, Mulan is the most disappointing remake Disney has made so far and by far. Even though Niki Caro delivers the realistic, distinct take that was promised, its execution feels inferior to the original animated film in every single way. Technically and visually, it's the first live-action remake from the respective studio that loses in almost every aspect to the 2D animation from more than twenty years ago. The 1998's movie is far more epic and cinematic than its remake. The disjointed editing is overworked to the point of omitting and skipping through character-defining moments. The action scenes are packed with unnecessary CGI that takes away from the war set pieces, which also look small in scale. The musical score isn't able to replace the songs from the original, overflowing the film with a weirdly empty feeling. Despite Liu Yifei delivering a good performance as the protagonist as well as a few of her colleagues, the acting is pretty mediocre overall. Story-wise, it's a mixed bag. It's an undoubtedly unique version, the furthest that a Disney's remake has ever been from its original, which will instantly upset some and please others. I praise the courage and bravery in producing such a different version. There are dozens of new additions that I sincerely appreciate, but their execution lacks emotional impact, ultimately being decisions inferior to the ones of the original. The message and essence of the original are still present through another perspective, which is the best compliment I can give to an otherwise quite disappointing remake...Rating: C-"
486,"Uninteresting story, cringe dialogue, cliche overall. Welcome to the world of modern Disney where plot just has to some way, no originality, just pump a lot of money on action and cgi. Donne yen and Jet Li were completely wasted."
487,THIS movie is nothing like the 1998 this is just a whole different story I mean the graphics and quality are great but the storyline doesn't go with the original Mulan I'm so disappointed there was no singing no mushu no cricket no orignal scenes like where the homie mushu at and every character has me all confused on which one is who I had my hopes up for nothing this movie disappointed me like even lion king live action had lions that CAN SING LIKE WHY CANT THE ACTORS SING It makes me sad that this wasn't orignal at all smh anyway don't waste your time on this if your expecting every scene from the original.
488,"There are a lot of things wrong with this film, but the thing that bothered me most was it's terrible message it sends to young girls. In the 90's Mulan, she has to work harder to be stronger/better fighter than the men. It shows that women can also be equal to men in abilities. In this movie, it's all about her supernatural powers. Basically saying that only women can be stronger than men, if they have some sort of supernatural gift. Thus, it's unrealistic for girls to see themselves in that role because Mulan relies mostly on this fantasy element."
489,"The movie was slow, lacked humor, love story, and flow. Overall the production was lacking."
490,This is just another soulless cash grab remake from Disney. The magic from the original is gone. There is nothing worth seeing here.
491,"In fact, I really don't know how to express my feelings,it's a really good movie,I think everyone should to see it,incomparable!"
492,"Such a great movie. Oh man I'm so pumped about it.I really like how they casted.I think this is the one live action Disney,like animated transfer,the capability of being not just as good as the original movie,but far more excellent than the original one.I'm very excited when Mulan kills enemies with her sword.
She's doing all the martial arts and cool stuff with the sword moving and that fight scene is pretty good.
I like watching her sword skills and the arrow in the air.It's so cool and I'm going to fall in love with her."
493,"Born in 91' and a lover of Mulan, it simply wasn't that bad. It could have been better yes, but it does not deserve less than a 6."
494,"First of all, I didn't watch Mulan in 1998. I found this movie spectacular to watch with the family. There are a lot of battles but no severed heads, bodies or blood. There is no blood anywhere. This is fantastic ! Very good, well done, well produced, with excellent performances. I couldn't even identify the famous Jet Li ... Congratulations to Disney! My wife and kids and I love it!"
495,"The ethereal beauty, Liu Yifei, stars as the legendary Chinese character, ""Mulan"". This is a grand epic that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen you can find. The battle sequences are breathtaking. The cinematography is gorgeous. However, the main reason to watch is the superb central performance by Liu Yifei. I was fully immersed in this version of the famous Chinese folk tale."
496,"Don't listen to the snobby negative reviews. If this was an independently made movie with a different title and people didn't have preconceived notions from the Disney original, critics would be raving. The story is clever and has plenty of substance, the cinematography is incredible, and the acting is emotive and just right. Everything about this movie was simply top class. Well worth the watch!"
497,"I don't know why people are giving this low ratings when it was definitely recreated uniquely. The main story is still there. Though they changed most scenes, they fit perfectly with how the story should go."
498,"I absolutely think this movie was outstanding it brought the reality of mulan and not the fantasy. I like how it didn't copy most of the cartoon in the movie. Yeah maybe it didn't have a musical in the movie but it added the melody of the song ""reflection"" which is sorta a honor base on the cartoon. I think the main actor that portrays Mulan did a good job pursuing that lead. By far I love it."
499,"Every family must send someone to fight for the Emperor, but Mulan can't bear to see her injured and aging father go off to war. Risking her life and defying her families wishes, she sneaks off to the army to fight in his place- as a boy. Can she succeed? Will she be found out?
Parents should know that it is more action oriented and more intense than the animated movie. The long scenes will bore younger viewers if the battle scenes don't scare them. Find our full parent review with discussion questions at Down The Hobbit Hole Blog dot com. The newest Disney live action remake is action and drama oriented, but I missed the heart and character connection that came with the comedy. While it's not my favorite of the Disney remakes, it's a good action movie and one that has a lot of great lessons in it!"
500,"This movie was engaging from beginning to end. Mulan has always been my favorite Disney film and I believe that this film deserves more credit then is currently given.Unlike other Disney adaptations, Mulan (2020) took its own form away from the original film, making it unique and a film in its own right. The storyline was entertaining, and there were occasional and subtle references to the original film for those who have watched the original. The film took a beautiful twist, and even though there was no singing in the film, the soundtrack was beautiful.I would definitely suggest not listening to the overly harsh reviews and just giving it a watch!"
501,"Its a very great family movie, however I loved the cartoon one more.
The cartoon one was funny and entertaining
This one os a bit more serious
But overall good for family night"
502,"This film is a winner with epic action and tantalizing drama .A young Chinese maiden disguises herself as a male warrior in order to save her father.The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous .Filming taking place in New Zealand and China. With a production budget of $200 million, it is the most expensive film ever made by a female director.Director: Niki Caro Writers: Rick Jaffa (screenplay by), Amanda Silver Stars: Yifei Liu, Donnie Yen, Li Gong, Jet LiAmazing set pieces. Every frame is like a work of art , stunning to look at . The film score is top notch . This film is not a musical and that decision to remake Mulan (2020) as a historical action drama really pays off in the end .Bringing the audience a fresh and new cinematic experience differentiating this fresh story from the charming Mulan (1998) American animated musical original.The action and martial arts fight sequences are very well done. Yifei Liu as the live action Mulan I read did 90% of her own stunt work . She rides horseback , wields a sword (Single-handed jian and scabbard of the 18th-19th century.) very convincingly. These are the type of skills the casting director were looking for specifically when they interviewed over a thousand candidates for the role of Mulan. Yifei Liu is perfection in her role. Her acting is some what ""stoic"" which in my opinion represent the Chinese culture perfectly. Yifei Liu was tremendous bringing the legend of Mulan to life .Disney's live-action adaptation of Mulan has earned a PG-13 rating. This would make Mulan the first of Disney's live-action films - based off of animated classics - to earn above a PG rating. This brings in the needed drama and action ramping up the intensity and grit to really make this film shine. I thoroughly enjoyed this epic-scale story about the power of being yourself in a world not ready to accept that, a tale that will likely always have resonance. 8/10"
503,"""In the much coveted role as Mulan, a cool, calm and collected Liu Yifei serviceably passes off as a virtuosic warrior with her well-trained gymnastic prowess (beautifully captured by the tired slo-mo treatment), but as so often she must conceal her comely femininity under a facile mannish comportment, she seems to err on the side of also bottling up Mulan's emotions, which leaves any inward outputting border on minimum, and the story of MULAN is actually very emotional (a baptism of fire experience about warfare, self-identity and defiance), but Liu mainly puts on a brave face and plows on without telegraphing much inner fluctuation, that is a major letdown.""reading the full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
504,"This movie was fantastic!! While transitions felt somewhat rushed( hoping for an extended version down the road) the story still held true to the original as well as the legend. Obviously a lot of people weren't paying attention to the fact that this version was mirroring more of the folklore and also emphasized on mulan and women finding they're courage, their voice, their place amongst men and not behind them.
Yifei was the perfect Mulan. She is Mulan. I don't believe they could've found someone better.
I loved the symbolism of the Phoenix. The fighting choreography was incredible. The scenery/setup beautiful. The father- daughter relationship tugged on my heartstrings and I loved the ending.. more powerful I think. Just incredible"
505,"Ow do you screw up this bad? U took a beloved story and made it ""woke"". Why? Hollywood should burn to the ground."
506,"I was not expecting a carbon copy of the original, what is the fun or point in that? We enjoyed the twists from the original. Would have liked to have seen more action from Jet Li but I guess that was the character.
I preferred the Pheonix as a symbol of her ancestors. Mushu is fine for an animated comedy sidekick but not really for a live action film.
I think critics are being harsh with their low ratings. Its a film for entertainment. I think it delivered. We like the new track as well."
507,"I ignored all the reviews before watching because I wanted to come to my own conclusion of the film. I went into it with the knowledge that Disney took a different approach to the story and didn't just make an exact live action version of the animated version. I came to this film as open minded as can be and still I'm disappointed. Sure I was upset that Mushu and the songs had been cut out, but I forgave that when they said they wanted be more loyal to the original legend. Still, this film failed to deliver.I cannot stand the addition of the ""witch"" character. I did my research to see if there's a witch in the original legend and no there isn't. In fact there are no supernatural elements in the original legend and this is a legend that came about in late 300s-500s A.D ! Disney wanted to play the ""loyal"" to the original source game, then why on earth did they get rid of the lovable supernatural elements like the ancestors, Mushu, and the cricket and trade them for this annoying addition of a witch ? This made no sense.In the animated version, the villain has a hawk sidekick. This movie gave that hawk a bigger role by having it be a witch. Like in Maleficent with the raven character from Sleeping Beauty being a shape shifter or something in the live action adaptation. The animated Mulan was much more realistic with the battle scenes even with Mushu and the cricket involved, the live action turned the battle scenes into fantastical nonsense by including this witch in the film. She talks to Mulan and Mulan eventually sympathizes with her, but it's just ridiculous. That was my main biggest pet peeve with this disastrous film.The songs were removed but you can hear their melodies in the background for some scenes. Yet they pulled a live action ""Lion King"" and have the characters talk the lyrics to the songs we all know and love. What in the world were they thinking ? Did they think people enjoyed the voice actor of Scar in the live action ""Lion King"" talking his way through ""Be Prepared ?"" All this did was show me how much I prefer the original animated version and in the middle of the film, I'm already thinking about rewatching the animated one.The fighting scenes are just cheesy. Disney makes this film to be more respectful to the Chinese community and they give them a film with comical kung-fu scenes. I mean I have no idea what was going through their heads when they made this? Even crazier that Disney was so confident with this one, with the way they acted with the release of this, they probably thought this was gonna be a big Oscar contender. If anything, maybe for the costumes, but in terms of direction, story, and acting - yeah right.This was a huge heads-up (as if a lot of the previous ones weren't already) that Disney needs to stop with the live action remakes. This was yet another soulless, shameless cash grab. They wanted to make it up to China since there was controversy with the animated version back in the late 90's, but I don't see how this embarrassment fixed anything. Disney, you want to know why China responded positively to Dreamworks Kung Fu Panda ? Apart from the animation of that time, they loved the idea that they respectfully used their culture to tell a fun, heartwarming story. Sadly that's clearly where Disney is lacking nowadays, storytelling, that's why they keep releasing unnecessary live action remakes every year.Do yourself a favor and skip this. Save the extra $30 if you're already a Disney Plus subscriber and just rewatch the 90's classic. 2 stars is generous, but the makeup and costume department deserve a positive shout out."
508,"Beautiful scenery, but that's all that this movie has got going for it, shocking dialogue, wooden acting, clichés everywhere, avoid this movie and watch the original animation"
509,"Despite the horrible adoption of the story, Liu's acting is appalling. I can't bear it at all. Seriously, find someone who can act to play Mulan. She's such a bad actress."
510,"I don't know why some people are just hating this film, they are not able to have something new on the adaptation. The cast, the landscapes, the new characters, the adaptation story and the battles was simply great. The people just don't know how to accept a new thing and are just spreading hate for a beautiful work like this one, they want to put things on the movie that are just infantile and just for children to watch. If you just hated it, just get back to the old Mulan, because that's for children.
Anyway, the movie is amazing and really fun to all the ages. Is a movie fully of beauty, culture and meanings. It brings strong representative of the women and the importance of loyalty.Stay home, stay safe, and don't forget to wear masks!"
511,"If you've never seen an action movie before, the action will seem a tad better than the offerings the Arrow verse has. If you've never seen a historical fiction/fantasy before, the scenery, costumes, sets will seem cool. If you've never seen a King Fu film before, the martial arts will be neat. If you've never seen the Disney film Mulon before you won't be missing all of the things that movie did better. Of you've seen any of the above mentioned films before, you will be board, confused and disappointed. The movie fails at being everything it tries to be...a historical fiction/fantasy martial arts action film based on a beloved Disney musical. Without the stunning show stopping musical numbers, the poorly paced action and story is much more noticeable. The sets and costume seem right at home in a musical, but seem very stagey for a modern action film. The actors do the best they can with what they are given but nobody could make sell a Disney musical that doesn't have the music as realistic. Save your $$$. Hard pass."
512,"It was a massive disappointment, I don't think I'll ever rewatch it. Disney removed all the good aspects of the movie and replaced them with cheesy new ideas. Just utter rubbish"
513,"There are only a few Disney movies I like. This is one of them. Another is Beauty and the Beast the original (animated).
Live action requires some difference from the animated version. This provides it. The scenery is beautiful, the actors are good and appropriate. The star is beautiful! The action was fantastic, and suspenseful. The storyline is as it should be, and I recommended very much."
514,"Mulan grows with me. The 1998 Mulan was for my childhood and the 2020 is for my adulthood. Great job Disney. BTW if you are looking for the same story as 1998, don't go. If you are expecting laughing Scenes, don't go because you will be burst into tears."
515,"I promise it's a great movie. I learned a lot from Mulan. She is loyal, brave and true. She is our hero. Liu Yifei has done a good job. She is beautiful and strong. Love her!!!"
516,Clearly the bots are at work given these many fake 1 or 2 star reviews. Niki Caro has done a fantastic job sensitively capturing the story of Mulan. Stunning cinematography by Australia's Mandy Walker. Well done crew. My family thoroughly enjoyed this action packed movie.
517,"There's no redeeming quality about this one.The 1998 animated was really really good : great writing, compelling characters.
The 2020 live action has... nothing.Female empowerement back then : it doesn't matter if you're not as physically strong as men. Use your wits and mental strength to overcome them.Female empowerement now : yeah, girl, you're a superhero, you don't need to train, just be yourself. Now do a backflip and kick that arrow !So lame...They ruined the character of Mulan. A clever, determined and kindhearted young woman who is now basically Captain Marvel. Yeah, whatever...I've wasted enough time talking about this. Don't watch it and thank me later. Watch the Disney anime or the 2009 live action instead."
518,Beautiful story produced by the Disney studios is like the phoenix rising from the ashes and reliving the old glorious days of a past era.
519,"This wasn't anything like the Disney movie. It was over the top ridiculous and had no charm. We tried, but didn't finish it."
520,"This movie is a disgrace to everything the original animated movie is and was; anyone who gives it a good score is either being too generous, has poor taste in movies, or is a bot account made by the chinese government."
521,"Phenomenal. I began this one with so much trepidation ... especially as I had never clicked with the original animated film.I was shocked to find myself at the edge of tears consistently. So many excellent lessons ... honor, respect, diligence. Heartfelt acting, strong cinematic work: altogether a most enjoyable experience. Warning: a tear-jerker.Thank you!!!"
522,"As said by others here, this moving is boring. My sister opened her book midway through the movie.
Save the $30 and just watch 2 hours of Windows Screensavers instead. The whole movie has no dialogue or character development and is done solely for the (admittedly beautiful) screen shots."
523,"Being a 80's baby and seeing the original movie I understood the wasn't bring back Eddie Murphy as the dragon I didn't like the ideal of that but base off the cartoon movie I was like ok let me give it a try It can't be that bad boy was I wrong this movie was tooooooooo serious more sad at to many moments then on top of that no fun at all no funny moments to me when you think of Disney associateed with any movie you think of fun at less funny in some type of way, I give it props and did hit on the honor part like the cartoon movie, but if they name it a different movie it would have hit better because It didn't seem like a mulan movie at all the actor from rush hour who play the father did a great job the lady who play the mom mm the lady who play the mulan did good base off what she was giving to work with which don't seem like much it was a all around bad movie to me because they took so many of the good elements out like the dragon which is one of the major Staples of the movie like donkey to Shrek Timon and Pumbaa to Simba."
524,"Why change the story?! Mulan would be much more impressive if she struggled to get by with the men and earned her achievements like in the cartoon, than this movie where she naturally has these incredible acrobatic gifts.
Plus the witch is completely ridiculous, just something added for progressive feminism. Could've been done so much better had they made this more like the original."
525,"They Even change the names of the characters.
It didnt have anything in commun with the original"
526,"Mulan was my favorite movie growing up. Everything about it was so perfect.
This film might not be so bad for the people who have never seen the original. However, I had high expectations going in. MUSHU is one of the most important characters. And I have every single song in this movie engrained into my head. Tough to watch, and is just boring.
It is the same as if the new Beauty and the beast had no music, and no talking cups, clocks, or candles.
Just doesn't provide the magic of Disney. HUGE disappointment."
527,Mulan was a mess from the beginning of the film to the end. The acting was terrible and many of the scenes were very unrealistic to even watch. The movie lacked in all action scenes and felt very low budget. It had the potential to be so much better ... sigh.
528,"A prime lesson how to gut out a classic animation and turn it into a generic low-fantasy movie. The movie is your typical Chinese production - a semi-historical, semi-realistic setting, with a sprinkle of absurd fantasy elements on top. As well as the usual melodrama and patriotic gibberish. There's a ton of mix messaging and tonal changes in the movie. In one scene Mulan is presented as some chi ninja wunderkind, in the next she's training hard alongside her fellow soldiers. In one moments she's kicked out of the army for being a woman, in the next she's leading the army in defense of the emperor. There's a side character that is probably the most inconsistent and ridiculous character I've seen in a movie. There was not a single scene in the movie with this character that didn't make me shake my head in disbelief.
Disney really wanted to get the Chinese market with this one. And I guess they did a good job at it, you can hardly get more Chinese than this."
529,Don't spend your money rewarding an actress who endorsed police violence!
530,"It is a Disney movie, yes - but even my 11 and 12 year old daughters thought this to be too boring! All the hype and hoopla has been for nought. Not at all entertaining. Also the acting for most part, was also poor!"
531,"How can somebody actually find anything positive in this film.
Funny, strong female character, good fight scenes, great music and gripping story... All can be said for the animated version, but not for this movie.
Truly worst movie I have seen this year."
532,"What a disappointment and waste of time and money on Disney's part. Wasted potential for an iconic feminist Disney animation and powerful story.
Sadly, the only good thing about this movie is the visuals.1. Where the hell is Mushu ? If you're going to tone down the magical/fairytale side of the animated version when bringing it to life, don't strip down the movie from one of its star and most loved characters to then replace it with a magical kite-looking pheonix and a witch (?!?!?). Nonsense.2. Where did all the depth of character and storyline go ? This sort of felt like a very tone-deaf ""look at all the cool fighting slow-motion tricks I've got/wannabe feminist"" film. Mulan's journey, unlike the original version, seems senseless and devoted of any profound emotion. She somehow is born with this inhumane ability to fight and do parkour which just defies the whole purpose of her journey and transformation shown in the 1998 film. In the original, she is courageous, defies all odds, develops into this powerful, witty protagonist (not karate kid warrior) that is motivated by her will to protect, not only her father, but China. You don't feel any of that in this remake.One of the most epic scenes of the animated version is when she FINALLY, after so much hard work, manages to make it up that pole. Now, she is just a born ninja who climbs a mountain when nobody else can because surprise surprise, she is the strongest and we knew it from the start.That moment she decided to let her hair down and tear down her armor in the middle of a war in the snowy mountains... my god. WHAT WAS THAT. Also, no one sees her save her companion while halting the fight with the avalanche which lessens the impact of her heroism and takes away all the magnitude of what she has just accomplished. Also why do her companions threaten to execute her if she ""shows her face again"" but then, 5 minutes later, decide to trust her entirely and let her lead the army into the emperor's palace ? So many things lack in logic and context. SO MANY THINGS.3. How many times can one say ""bring honor"" and ""chi"" in a 2 hour long film. Seriously, overdone.4. THE MUSIC. Oh my goodness, what happened to the music ? The original tracks are nothing less than iconic. They could have at least integrated instrumental versions of them (other than just adding instrumental ""Reflection"" to every suppose-to-be emotional scene).5. The acting... oh the acting. Terrible. The script is generic, boring, dull. This obviously does not help the actors, but jeez. Not only do interactions between characters just feel... uncomfortable, but the wannabe jokes are just terrible and awkward. Everyone's acting seems forced. No character building throughout the movie. You do not get attached to anyone, not even Mulan, not even her ""goofy"" friends. Wow I really missed Chien-Po, Yao and Ling from the 1998 version.
This movie felt like a very generic martial arts, Jackie Chan-style (without the fun and humour) film, lacking in any kind of tone, sentiment or Disney magic. The remake has no soul so watch the original."
533,"When i initially found out that Disney will be making a live Mulan movie i was somewhat intrigued. Well, having seen it just now on i can understand why it has so low score. The costumes and locations are beautiful, but that's about it - the acting of the characters is totally flat, as everything else in the movie. It's really disappointing to see such a classic cartoon movie to be ruined in this way and we can thank once again Disney for that.
3/10, watch it only if you absolutely, definitely have nothing else to do and just want to waste 2 hours of your time."
534,"Mulan was my all time favorite Disney movie and I wished it had been made into a live movie long before Disney started doing the live movies.
That being said this movie was a true disappointment.The storyline was completely altered.A witch was added for literally no reason at all.Mulan was always a good fighter in this film - so you did not really feel like her character developed into a good fighter like you did in the animation.The music was GONE. Barely any music at all.The comedy was GONE. It felt dark and not as light as the animated film.The best parts of the original animation were completely ignored and removed from this film. There were no goosebumps or feel-good moments in the film the way it was done in the animation.Everything aside from the fight scene at the end of the movie was a complete disappointment.The movie was okay but don't expect to see the Mulan you remember and love. This movie is simply a movie that is similar to the Mulan animation but nowhere near as excellent.The animated script was perfect and it shouldn't have been changed for this film. Beauty and the beast and the lion king hit the nail on the head because they stuck to the wonderful scripts and soundtracks that Disney created.Mulan missed the mark."
535,"I couldn't even watch it till the end. They left out everything that was good about Mulan. They changed the main characters, and gave us some new, but they not even near as good as the original ones. And in my opinion Mulan has the best songs in disney history and they didn't use them. It's the biggest disappointment in my life. They dishonored my favourite disney tale...I hope they apologise for what they have done one day"
536,"I want to give credit, where credit is due. The scenery is quite beautiful some places and most of the time, the actors do a good job. The story is mediocre, at best, and doesn't quite land the Asian vibe, neither the western vibe. I just kind of floats in the middle.Here are some of my main frustration points:Chi. They introduce and talk about chi, as if it is some sort of magic. Everyone has chi, we are told, but we only see two people with ""strong chi"" or ""chi magic"". Mulan and a Witch. It is never explained what chi can do and why it gives someone the power to change forms or turn into thousands of birds or anything...The only explanation as to why Mulan is so naturally gifted, is because of ""chi"" - which she apparently has more of than average. From the start it is established that Mulan is ""over-powered"" and apparently is quite masterful of many things, without needing to train or earn her power. This sets us up with the feeling, that Mulan will overcome anything without having to put in much effort, which makes her very hard to connect with as a character.The side-characters are boring. They introduce Yao, Po and Ling, Cricket is also a person apparently. There are a few interactions, and honestly seeing those guys together is quite nice. Too bad we get very little time to get to know them. They also created a new character, Honghui, who acts like a ""love interest"" throughout the movie, until the end where Mulan decides ""No, I'm a 2020 women, I don't need a man"" and she leaves without him. What was the point of even adding him? Just DON'T have a love interest AT ALL if this is the message you want to send. She clearly liked him, so why leave?They introduce this Witch character, who can shapeshift and is a master warrior. Creating this character is rather uninspired. Not only that, she - and the change they bring with her, aka ""chi magic"" - seems to actually go against some of the teachings of the original 1998 movie. The women of this movie (the Witch and Mulan) are only as good/better than the men because they have this (unfair?) advantage of magic chi. The original movie taught us that resourcefulness and intellect is what gets Mulan her victory, but this movie teaches us that if you are born with extra power, then you can win. It's a strange message.Apparently a lot of people can catch arrows mid-air, just before they get hit. This becomes a thing throughout the movie and it's a bit stupid. It almost becomes a point of the movie, since the villain dies to an arrow which he did NOT catch. That arrow was kicked off by Mulan (yes, kicked... She kicks arrows and spears and.. Don't get me started).The Witch can take form of any person, often flies around as a falcon, and can shoot ninja-stars with lightning speed. Major plot hole: Why didn't the Rouran raider leader just ask her to fly to the Imperial City, fly up to the emperor, take him out and throw the country into chaos? Afterwards they could swoop in while the army and the cities were in disarray, and they could have taken over the country without suffering too many losses. Instead they use her to speak with the emperor (privately, that is) and lure him into an unfinished temple...Finally the villain actually captures the emperor (not before Mr Emperor slaps some bad guys to death with a curtain of course - no I'm not kidding, it's a curtain). The bad guy doesn't kill the emperor yet, because like any other villain he must do it in some elaborate way. So, he has some melted steel and some torches and wants to burn the emperor alive.Overall a lot of minor things that I didn't really like:
The scenes between Mulan and her father are slow and don't feel as emotionally strong as they do in the 1998 version.In the end Mulan loses her fathers sword and says ""I now know how much that sword meant to you"" but, like, how does she know that? They didn't tell us or show us why this sword was important. There was no ""this was my fathers sword, he earned it when blablabla."" or ""It has been in my family for generations"" or any of that stuff. Just a sword, dude.We don't see any other witches or hear why they are feared. I mean, the Witch shows is why they fear her, but she explains her own backstory that people distanced themselves from her because of her power. Why did people fear her, before she even started doing bad things? It's not explained. Suddenly it doesn't have anything to do with being a woman, but has all to do with this magical power which no-one even explains to us.It doesn't have any of the lighthearted Disney moments and it doesn't have a strong emotional impact.Overall: Uninspired, boring and full of clichés. Mediocre movie, with some laughable martial arts moments. Once in a while they cite the original songs, though, so that's nice... 2/10."
537,"Remake of:
Beauty and the beast was a musical.
Lion king was a musical
Aladdin was a musicalThose movies were passable. Why did they not make Mulan a musical? And why did they not stick to the original story? These classic movies were good because of WHAT THEY WERE. In order to be loved by people who liked the originals, they should NOT be changed.The attempt that disney made to modernize this film was not executed well at all. If you want to make a movie that adheres more to todays current events, then do another movie! Do not change a beautiful classic that we all love and hold close to our hearts.I was expecting so much more from this movie. I am glad I watched it at a friends house, and did not pay for it. Its sad that Disney now has schemes of hoarding their titles and only making them available on their website.."
538,"This movie is just a sequence of scenes, it has zero soul or emotional impact. An empty shell compared to the animation"
539,"I don't even know where to start. If you're a fan of the animated original Mulan as I am than please please do not watch this movie. It is a slap in the face to those who loved the whit, charm, and message of the 21 year old animated film. The movie does not even give us those big moments from the animation In the live action, for example the scene where Mulan cuts her hair and dawns her fathers armor which is a very impactful and emotional scene in the original, is not even in the movie, it is broken down to Mulan pointing her sword at the camera and one cross dissolve later and she's armored up ready for battle. You can forget charm or Disney magic of any kind; it is one thing that this ""realistic"" take on Mulan does not have Mushu (dragon) or the cricket but when you take the music out of the film than you lose what little Disney magic you could have had. Oh yeah and did I mention that in this ""realistic"" iteration of Mulan the main antagonist can literally shapeshift into a bird!!!!! Another strong gripe and possibly the strongest is the message from the original Mulan is completely dragged through the mud in this version. In the original Mulan does what they thought only a man could do, and she did it through her strong will and determination to bring peace to her land and prove that she isn't inferior just because she is a woman. Now that is still the main message in this movie but it has no weight to how Mulan proves that she is better. (SPOILER ALERT) It is revealed that Mulan is special; she has something called Chi which pretty much makes her superhuman. She can run on walls and do insane flips like she's in the matrix and it pretty much just makes her a superhero. And this is where the movie lost me. By saying that Mulan proved everyone wrong and that a strong determined woman could make it in a mans army and world that is perfect, that is the perfect message and the original did it perfectly. But when you say, oh yeah she saved the day because she has super powers and not because she worked harder than anyone else to be the best than that is where you lose me. The standard that this movie sets is not empowering to woman. It tells them that you have to be born special to make a difference. In the original it tells the viewer that if you work hard and never waver than you will reach the top of the mountain. Oh yeah and the other stuff in the movie are terrible as well. The main actress is dull, lacks any sort of emotion, and just seems dead the entire time. The special effects are up to Disney standard(the only good thing about the movie) and the action is terrible, WAY to many cuts. All in all Mulan was a terrible watch and it makes it even worse that I spent 30 bucks on this colossal piece of s**t. I have lost all faith in Disney. I thought Aladdin was bad oh no this movie makes Aladdin look like Schindlers List. I cannot express my deep deep hatred for this movie. If you made it this far thank you very much for reading my rant, and have a nice day."
540,"I'm happy to have paid the $30 to watch it from home with my family. I love the first one, and this one did not disappoint me at all! There were some slight alterations to the cartoon version, but they were not missed."
541,"""What was the point in doing a live action Mulan movie when it's spoken in English and not Mandarin. Where are the Huns? Where is Mushu? Where's Li Shang?"" Was what I thought in the beginning, but as the movie progressed I realized the changes had an impact on the story. I love how they brought in Ming-Na Wen for a small role and she presented Hua Mulan to the Emperor, it was like seeing Mulan and Mulan on the same screen"
542,Bad and super cheesy scenario! They managed to take a good story and turn it into an expensive screw up!
543,"This movie was beautifully filmed and with good pacing. The leads were well developed and skillfully rendered by the actors. The script followed the animated version, with the obvious differences.I was stunned at the low reviews. I mean, it's a Niki Caro movie! When I read the user reviews, it was obvious that a lot of people don't like change. They complained about the $30 price...how much do you spend on going to the movie theater. I don't blame Disney. This would have been terrible to have been released to movie theaters and achieve low numbers because of COVID fears. Other opinions was that it was too slow or it ruined their childhood. Sure I liked Eddie Murphy in the original, but you can still enjoy this mature version too. This version is an instant Disney classic, and one that my wife and I will continue to enjoy for years. What a wonderful vision Niki Caro and cast and crew and Disney have given us."
544,"First of all, I agree with the other critiques saying that this version of Mulan has few if any similarities with the original animations. However, I don't really mind it as much and went in to this expecting Mulan (2020) to be its' own thing with no connection to the animation.The scenery, the animations and the choreography are all fantastic. You have colorful environments filled with unique architecture, clothing and people that create a vagrant living world. The battles are well rehearsed with the camera team capturing all the juicy overpowered fightingmoves.However, what killed the joy of this movie for me was the story. It's filled with plotholes. Every single struggle, every single obstacle is avoided or handled with deus ex machinima. Meaning that in every scenario there's a lucky occurrence that somehow creates the PERFECT scenario for Mulan to easily do whatever is necessary. To use an example that's not in the movie and doesn't spoil the storyline: If Mulan would've had to assassinate an enemy commander in a camp filled with hundreds of elite soldiers, trained from childhood. Then the level of plotholes in this movie would be equivalent of all those elite soldiers being unable to see Mulan walking past them, waving her hands above her head, because she's a head shorter than the soldiers."
545,"I keep seeing comments all over social media about how people don't want to even bother watching this movie because there is""no mushu and no songs/music"". I'm telling you to just go watch it. This movie was indeed very different than the cartoon but it also had all the characters and many nearly identical scenes to the original movie. Other than that, there is a kind of version of Mushu in the film that is summoned by the father the same way he did when mushu was sent by the ancestors. The difference is that he is a Phoenix instead of a Dragon and he does not speak. He guides Mulan throughout her journey and empowers her. Mulan is also a lot more powerful in this film than in the original. She is the one to reveal her own true identity to her men because she felt she needed to embrace the virtue of truth in order to fully embrace her power. She isn't caught like in the original. As far as music goes? Absolutely not. That would have completely ruined this film. The tone of this movie is a bit more serious than your typical Disney live action remake. It's a war movie. It has its light hearted moments but the overall tone is serious. There is one scene where they speak the lines to one of the songs. The score includes the original music but no singing. The stunts and fighting in this movie were also extremely good. There were stunts in this movie done on horseback I've never seen done before. As a general rule I don't think Disney really shows blood in any of their movies and even though this movie is very violent, you never see any blood. The fighting and scenes of dead soldiers could be quite frightening for little ones so be careful about watching this one with very young children. Like I said, this IS a war movie with a few brutal fight scenes where many people are killed. The overall movie was amazing and I think people should really give it a shot before they just brush it off for ""not being like the original""."
546,This is NOT Mulan. It's offensive to even call it Mulan.
547,"It's Disney. It's Mulan. We expect a certain degree of fantasy (perhaps even a lot) and a certain degree of over-the-top. This presentation however has little in the way of heart, soul, or believability. (Seriously... killing someone by THROWING an arrow? Only the most gullible would believe that adulteration of basic physics.)I can't go further into the ""why's"" of failure without spoilers, so I'll just have to leave it at that. I don't compare this to the animated version as some do; I judge it by its own merit. (However, the animated version WAS far better.) The acting in this was good, the sets incredible. The choreography was acceptable (though many Asian martial arts far excel in that aspect). The music wasn't all that impressive; typical Disney fare that didn't match the Mulan setting at all.So get ready for an action movie with a story story that falls fall short of expectations. I have enjoyed several other Disney remakes, but this one didn't cut it. The plot is rather pedestrian, with nothing to put this above a mediocre ""another Disney attempt"" 5-stars."
548,"I'm only giving it 3 stars because of the beautiful landscapes and action. The screenplay is horrible. It's made for children under 6 or for imbeciles. Characters are flat and often plain stupid, certain story details make no sense, it is super obnoxious in propagating its outdated values. Every second line is ""loyal, brave, true"" or ""family is most important"". Blah!"
549,"There was a lot to like about this movie, but I was surprised by the serious tone. I wouldn't call this a ""kids"" movie, though. Very little comic relief. It certainly took serious the female theme of living in a male dominated culture.You're likely familiar with the story, Mulan is the daughter of a former soldier. When they are attacked by the antagonist' army, each household must send one male from the family. Mulans father has an old war injury and will face certain death, but he is the only male in the household. So Mulan takes his place, impersonating a man and in the process, risks bringing dishonor to the family.I'll leave out spoilers, but one thing that was a bit disappointing was the absence of Mushu. They replace him with a Phoenix thats more symbolic than an actual character.The acting was good enough to not hinder the story telling and the cinematography was beautiful. I found the fighting sequences entertaining even if embellished the stereotypical tropes in ""kung fu"" type fighting movies a little bit.Don't let the bad reviews pursuade you. Wait until December and don't pay the $30 if you tend to judge live action movies against their animated counterparts. But this movie is good enough on its own. My wife, 6 year old and I liked it and we had zero expectations going in. Yet we were surprised at the low ratings and generally disagree with them."
550,"First of all it does not deserve $30 more.
Secondly, the plot totally different from original literature.
Third the actress just simply not good enough."
551,"Wow I can't believe I spent $30 dollars on this boring lifeless movie. My daughter fell asleep 40 minutes in, and my wife couldn't care less what was going on So she went on tiktok. Which left me being The lone Survivor watching this soulless wanna be crouching Tiger movie. Anybody giving this movie anything above a 6 must've been smoking some good stuff."
552,"I enjoyed it as it should be, an entertaining piece of great movie making visually and plot progressively ascending to its finale. Great cast. They had me at Gong Li, as usual. She's divine!"
553,"So ive watched Mulan and despite being on the edge of my seat at the end, there are some weaknesses. Mainly in recognition of what her character does Her efforts in training aren't rewarded as she simply does it because of her special inner force. Even when she completes the training task a.k.a removing the arrow from the top of the tower in the cartoon (its different in the movie). The only people to notice are her fellow soldiers, her commander is absent.
Similarily in the battle scene later no one witnesses her basically make the enemy retreat all by herself. Yet somehow after this period of no one noticing her worth. They all conclude she is the best of them all and decide she should save the emperor. It makes you wonder if the director actually watched the orginal.
All this being said it was a rewardable viewing experience though its clearly been ovepriced by disney and ive yet to see a positive review based on this price point.."
554,"Mulan rides on the coattails of my favorite Disney cartoon and strips it of everything compelling and entertaining. Let's take emotional impactful scenes such as the introduction of the Huns, The role-call of the enlistment of the families, Mulan fighting about her place in family and leaving home that give the original movie it's beautiful identity. This movie makes those emotion-filled scenes, and well reduces it monotone, un-dramatic scenes. The dialogue is so bad, oh my God... The threat of the Huns or what ever they're called in this is nothing compared to that of the first one. The lack of showing the Huns in the cartoon and just their destruction made them seem that much more menacing. This movie strips that all away. All of it. Mulan's trials to overcome her constraints as a sheltered woman to become the strongest amongst the troops? None of that. She's OP from the start with her chi. And the whole time the only problem in the movie is not her hiding her disguise but her guilt of hiding it. The whole reason was to save her family and not risk her own family's honor. This time, there's no threat of such, there's no threat at all, and the sequence of events to get to that wasn't compelling, she had a fight, she wasn't as strong since she was 'lying to herself'. Like what? You aren't lying to yourself, you're literally saving your dad, and giving your family honor and keeping it a secret to others, it's not a moral dilemma, BUT I SUPPOSE TO THE CHINESE STATE, DO NOT LIE TO THE STATE NO MATTER WHAT ITS ABOUT I GUESS. That is glossed over and just like, 'oh I want to show how strong Mulan is'. And when you take out Mushu, No Eddie Murphy? No entertaining side character? Wow, it's dull. You may ask while watching this, oh it's bad but not bad enough to walk out of. It is that bad. It literally is so bad, I felt like walking out, but I couldn't cuz someone bought it and I didn't wanna be rude. But it was funny we all wanted to leave but felt it would be rude, even the person that bought it. I could write a book on how this movie sucks. I'm thinking of the meme template of The Godfather saying 'look how they killed my boy'. Look, I hate Disney's live action adaptations, only one I could tolerate was Beauty and the Beast. But when you strip a movie of funny scenes you have to replace it with something right? NOPE! Just make the most monotone, dialogue. OH MULAN JUST LEFT HOME, if we get her the army will kill her, the dialogue was so monotone and it was the writers were a bunch of 3rd graders. I am critical of movies, especially when I hold very special place in my heart for its original. I can say, this is perhaps the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Shame on Disney. Making people pay 30 bucks for this garbage. Hamilton was FREE????!!?!!? BUT THIS WAS 30 BUCKS!??!!? Dude, hope the Chinese government censors and you make no money cuz one of the characters resembles Winnie the Pooh."
555,"Mulan has a lot of heart. It packs all the right punches and teaches so many lessons to us along with the main three and the fourth at the end to most importantly be who we are and not hide our emotions and rise like the Phoenix. This movie I knew going in was not the remake of the original animated classic but it does tell the same story in a new and interesting way that feels real. The lead actress was amazing as Mulan, she did a fantastic job along with the rest of the cast. Donnie Yen and Jet Li both are given good roles and time to showcase their talents without ever overshadowing the main character. I was moved by the movie and would recommend to watch the movie on its own merit and not comparing to the original. This is a movie that stands on its own and does a commendable job at matching the lofty expectations set by the original."
556,"Just trying to be nice because I feel bad seeing the score at a 4.5! It is NOT that bad people, come on. This movie was meant for the big screen because it just doesn't do justice at home. The acting is pretty embarrassing except for the witch. I think they did a great job having Mulan showing some potential as a ""skilled fighter"" as a young age because it's way more believable than just having some short training and all of a sudden becoming the best warrior of all. But there are things I do agree with, with other reviews. But to be fair it is NOT a 4.5...even though I gave a 10 to be nicer than others I'd say my honest review of Mulan is a 6.9 or 7. I do not think it's worth $30 unless you have a big projector and a few friends over to watch with. Otherwise, watch it later :) (but I understand the urge to watch it just out of ones own curiosity)"
557,I think little girls all over the world will be inspired by this movie.
558,"My oldest daughter was told it was bad but my youngest daughter and I decided to form out own opinion. Four Thumbs Up it was Fantastic, Music Full of Emotion and Wonder! Please see it for the human form not animation. You cannot deny us Wonder I'm not sure how these reviews could be this low. I hope that the actors,creators, directors, producers take pride in this and ignore these horrible reviews. It made my daughter and myself very proud."
559,Had high hopes for this movie....however this movie sucked! I think I was hoping they were going to stay with the same story line but nope. Don't waste your time or money on this POS!
560,"Remove mushu and shang, remove all songs and comedy..... whats left then????"
561,"This is not the best Disney live action remake , however it is still lots of fun ! Highly recommend this stunning movie !"
562,"This film is nothing but cute and pretty to watch , otherwise it is not a very good movie. The visuals and the story are nice."
563,Honestly I thought this was a fun movie for what it was. Not the worst film I have seen and not the best. I'd give it a watch just for the visuals.
564,"Honestly the movie itself isn't a bad movie and probably would have a higher score if they didn't slap ""Mulan"" on it. This movie is just simply NOT Disney's Mulan. People who expected a live action remake of Mulan got something entirely different. This should have been a stand alone film with a different name for the title character. I recommend watching this as if it isn't supposed to be a ""live action remake"" because of you have that mentality you are going to be extremely disappointed."
565,"Such an extraordinary movie I have ever watched! This movie can make you feel deeply the part of a warrior. And definitely, woman can be like a man. Or maybe more like a man"
566,"The film deserves better than the moronic, blind anger by jealous people who rejoice in destroying others' work."
567,"The character of Mulan is boring and a super human living in a land of mortals. Even if this wasn't a ""remake"" it would still be a bad movie."
568,"Though not an entirely un-watchable film, Mulan unfortunately did not live up to the hype generated by extensive publicity and buzz. Fantastic cinematography and stunt work though, but sadly the best bits were when there was no verbal exchanges going on. There was definitely potential to be great. Even though the cast did the best that they could with what they were given, it was not enough to make up for lacklustre screenplay and writing. Gong Li, Jason Scott Lee, Donnie Yen to name a few, were great in the film. Some scenes and decisions made by characters made absolutely no sense at all. Disappointed to see that the film still contained some inconsistencies with both the time period and portrayal of the characters and settings (I suppose we have to overlook these as it is a Disney film after all). Personally hoped that they would have incorporated the Chinese culture and in a larger way (such as having some conversations in Mandarin, it is Mulan after all), as well as more subtle yet meaningful messages of female empowerment.
There were some obvious pacing issues with the film, but overall, lacked the Essence and heart of the original."
569,"They could've just remade the exact same movie as the 98' rendition but with real people, dubbed in a fun loving mushu, and kept the quirks and the people would've gone ballistic! This is a horrible take at trying to redo something that's been a cult classic for years. Will be showing my children the animated version and praying for centuries to come they never know this version so much as exists."
570,"When I first heard that a live action remake of Mulan was not going to have all the things that made the animated version so likeable (e.g. no Mushu, none of those nostalgic catchy music aside from the boring overrated 'Reflections', and getting rid of the fun comedy aspect of the original film), I immediately felt a big letdown by the big Mouse House. Needless to say, I knew this movie was going to flop. A serious mature version of Mulan has been made many times by Chinese filmmakers (and ALL have been forgettable) so if Disney had done their research they would know this.A mature Mulan movie has never succeeded financially so Disney was indeed full of themselves for thinking that their mature version of Mulan would be any different. I feared that this film would become another Hong Kong martial arts film and sure enough, it did. The dumb wireworks, running up walls and defying gravity just made this film even more stupid to watch. They were not executed as well as wuxia films made in Hong Kong/China. Sure the visuals (sets and backdrops) are nice to look at but nothing that other Hollywood big budget films haven't provided before. Disney should have kept this live Mulan like the animated version.This film's biggest mistake was hiring the wrong director to helm this project. It's evident that Niki Caro is not a true fan of the animated Mulan for if she was, she would have never considered this awful script (especially the idea of a Mulan gifted with Chi from birth) and excluded the best scenes from the cartoon version (the scene where Mulan stayed awake at night to contemplate about her decision to take her father's place in the army and the build up to her putting on the armor and riding off into the night or how she was outted at the end involuntarily). Here Mulan willingly exposes her identity all the while risk getting executed with nothing at all to gain from doing so. There's also a Wonder Woman moment in this version where Mulan took off her armor and let down her hair - it's a wonderful scene to look at but seriously - Earth to Mulan! What were the writers thinking?! You need those armor to protect you, especially in a battle where you are already outnumbered! I'd blame the Director for allowing this ridiculous script to come to life on screen.Another major mistake was leaving out Shang. The romance between Mulan and General Li Shang was not controversial like Disney had stated due to the #MeToo movement. It is quite the contrary because Shang never harassed Mulan or made any inappropriate moves on her even after finding out that she's a girl. There was rumor that Shang might have been perceived as gay/bisexual for falling for Mulan. But in the animated version, Shang never even thought of Mulan in that way while she kept her identity hidden. It was only because he found out that she was a girl that he started to realize what a wonderful woman she is and therefore she became a potential romantic prospect for him. Like most single young men of the time, marriage is most likely important to Shang and to find a suitable girl is challenging, especially for military men who have very few if any options. So there was nothing homo or bi about Shang - and if that was the reason his character was excluded from this live action - then all the more proof that Disney chose the wrong people to make this film - or worse, that the creative team behind this project is a tad too closeminded.Despite what others have said, if Disney wants to remake their hit animated classic films, they need to stick to the same winning formula that made the original version worked. Ignore the critics and keep it simple! The box office revenues of the live action Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Cinderella and The Lion King are all the proofs you need to know that this is true. Stray from the winning formula like this awful Mulan and Dumbo did and the films will suffer."
571,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Right from the start you can feel the cringe. It's diffucult not to compare it to the original because most people who will see it, will have watched it. But there's no nostalgia here, the most memorable scenes are either botched or excluded, and if you are planning to watch it with your kids, they will surely fall asleep within the first 15 minute, as this movie has the strangest pacing issues, jumping all over the place without a coheseve exposition. Cast doesn't help it either, dialogues are so dumb, and the delivery is so unbeliavable that it looks like they were dubbed over the real dialgoues. Although I am biased towards Yifei Liu over her stance on Hong Kong protests, which is in itself an amazing irony, I can safely say that she doesn't own the role, it is as if she just stood there and the film happned around her. The main boss of the movie in the form of Drogo and Melisandra make as much sense as any other villain in Chinese pseudo-historical flick. Cinematography is mostly bad blue screen, film doesn't look like an American production, the wire-work is iffy and obvious, scenes with pagodas and the palace are few and far between. And lastly, the music from the original is used at the most unexplainable moments and is heard for 2 bars only at most. I can't think of a single moment I liked about this film."
572,"I was really excited for this one, but it was sooo bad. For anyone who is a fan of the original cartoon, I advise you not to watch this, it will anger you deeply. Horrible."
573,"First of all nothing looked totally right...makeup, clothing, sets, nothing. Some things looked totally wrong, some things looked Japanese, and who knows what. And who the hell were the villain's, Were they supposed to be Mongolian? They were from the North, but they did not look Mongolian. And the capital by the silk road.Not even one Chinese writer, which could be understandable if you have somebody that seemed to know something about the Chinese. But no...go through the list. Maybe some of the visual designers were even Asian, but not many. How could they screw up so badly. There is a ton great talent in China. For 300 million, could have gotten everyone involved in the makeup, set deign, costumes, any art, from China. And to show how stupid the people were, a phoenix. That is from Greek and Roman. How stupid do you have to be not to use a dragon. And for the script, if they had just followed the animated feature, that would have worked so much better. The producers were a were total fail except the on screen cast.I will let slide the swords on the back since only a few people realize how stupid that is. Maybe some day it will finally be realized that almost everybody wore the sword low. And the swords were not right, but close. The primary weapon was gong to be a the long lance (pi). And the silly shields. Guess I should at least be happy that in Viking shows now they have a hand grip in the boss.At least I should be they did not throw in some Americans, or whoever for the on-film cast."
574,"While the action is fun, this version has no heart. Cardboard characters are introduced in rapid fire with no story and no personality. I found myself not caring about any of these characters as they prepare for war...or while they die in it. Mulan's personality is void of dimension and just feels like you're watching a robot go through the motions. The action keeps you watching, although completely ridiculous.I actually didn't even care how this ended and walked away from the TV while the last 15 minutes of the movie ran on."
575,There are so many problems with this movie. I watched it for five minutes and the first scene was so stupid. Like how does a little kid flip on the roof and magically land on the floor. Like WHAT?! Also later in the movie the Hang army just some how makes a catapult when they in the middle of fighting. Which makes now sense as well. Another horribly done thing was that they removed basically all the funny characters and all the songs. Like WTF was this director thinking! The last straw was that the freaking Hang army somehow can run up walls and Bori Khan's Eagle is like a witch. Like that makes no sense. Lol! Who ever wrote this script was on something.
576,"I've only seen the 1998 Mulan twice and enjoyed it as an animated movie but at no point did I expect them to remake it live action and stick to the original story.Don't expect Eddie Murphy to pop up as a dragon following Mulan around trying to keep her identity a secret, that would never have worked in this remake. Although there are some 'magical' elements I think they found a good balance between believability and the suspension of disbelief.The main theme I took away from this film is family honour and respect are important in Chinese culture and I feel the movie addressed these virtues well.A lot of reviews complain about the lack of the 1998 elements but those would never have worked in a live action movie.Don't believe everything you read from users reviews (including this one).watch it for yoyrself and go in with an open mind."
577,"I expected way too much from this movie, so I was pretty disappointed upon watching. I was looking for this 'magical feeling' the disney films are known for, but only felt this in a few of the very last scenes. They even replaced the dragon with a very annoying Phoenix.
The acting is sometimes very stiff but hey; they get the job done. And this 'they get the job done' goes for the whole movie. Everything from the cgi to the ost is just decent, not amazing, not bad, just ok. You'd think a company like Disney could do more with a movie like this and thats just a pretty annoying thought to end the movie with."
578,"...I couldn't believe the consistently low scores by the typical movie audience. Comments like ""wooden acting"" and ""no soul""?!? C'mon people! If you take into consideration the timeline and ethnic (male-centric) culture, the display of - or reserve from displaying - emotions was totally apropos. Don't tell me you were expecting Mulan to break character and lead China's first feminist movement back in the day (4th-6th century AD)?I remember when Disney first announced their plans to re-make Mulan into a live-action film. At the time, I thought their decision to ditch Eddie Murphy's character from the original was sacrilegious! But the live-action version made me a believer. The function of Murphy's character was to be a comedic sidekick to Mulan; this was unnecessary since the live-action version was targeting a wider/older audience.My last jab at the negative reviews addresses the artistic liberties taken to re-tell the original Mulan movie; converting an animated movie into a live-action film. I'll cite two relative examples: a) The Lion King and b) The Jungle Book, both live-actions directed by one of my favorites, Jon Favreau. The Lion King was a near replica of the original, where I barely made it to the 20-minute mark going in. The Jungle Book provided a different version -filled with all the same characters. Now, if I had never seen either of the animated originals then I probably would have enjoyed both movies equally. As a returning customer, I was less impressed by TLK's live-action cinematography than caring to go down memory lane; I already knew the movies' ending and felt I was watching a rerun.TJB was a fresh approach to a movie I saw as a child. It kept my attention throughout. Similar to driving home after work, would you take the normal route that you could do blindfolded or would you take a new route (to see if it's a shorter route, maybe it's more scenic, perhaps it's more driver-centric, etc.). For whatever reason, a new route/version engages to driver/movie audience.That's my two cents on this matter. Give this new version of Mulan a chance...it won't disappoint."
579,"Many motives to see it, from controverses - with political connotations , to Li Gong and costumes, the try of authenticity and fight scenes . Its only real sin - each remake of lovely animation becomes a sort of fiasco. Because, against effort, nothing new is possible. The comparation works and the film is not the winner. The only reason for make the new Mulan seems to propose a new star. Liu Yifei deserves more than this start . But , sure, new generations, new Disney versions of classics works."
580,"In contrast to all the other reviews I read here, I actually really liked the movie. I have to admit, some characters added like the witch take away parts of the movie that could have done better, and took away elements such as betrayal.Maybe it's because I haven't really watched all the older Mulan movies, but I liked the movie. Regardless of the obvious ending and decisions made by the director."
581,"Overall a well done film, it obviously missed the musical score of Disney films which i was really hoping for. The graphics and set locations were stunning. I didn't expect it to be at all similar to the animation, somewhat glad they have created a remake with its own identity but at the same time if you took the Disney name off the posters etc, you wouldn't know it was one!"
582,"Mulan is basically a marry sue here. Save your money, is not worth it."
583,"I've read some negative reviews about this show, and I really don't understand why they hate it. All I ever read are articles about irrelevant political drama concerning the actress, ""historical/folklore inaccuracies"", and their biased judgement towards the cartoon.I think people get too fixated on the idea that the live-action would religiously follow the cartoon, which it did to some extent but added their own ""twist and concepts"", which apparently, most likely triggered people who went watching the film with the wrong mindset. Coming from a casual movie watcher, who doesn't really care about anything but simply interested for some good casual story-telling, action, and visuals, I think it's an enjoyable watch, it's your average action film that follows a historical setting with a storyline influenced by the original cartoon to an extent.It's a great film to watch on your family movie day, or whatever. People just expected too much due to the original being such a worldwide recognized Disney title throughout the years, and let's be honest, any film for that matter that tries to compete, or borrows the plotline from a popular title never really succeeds because we all have these biased viewers who passionately loved the original and their way of judging is tainted by their one-sided influence - and of course, you really can't take any original out of its throne when it has been a part of everyone's childhood.Bias criticisms, inaccuracies to whatever, and an actress's political opinion, what does that have to do anything with the film? Mulan is a fantasy action film based on a Chinese legend, from action to the art, whether or not that was portrayed accurately, that doesn't give a show a major flaw. The flow of the film was great and wasn't severely rushed, the cinematography, and action sequences were obviously done well, the prop aesthetics, animations, and effects were pleasant to my eyes as an Artist. Of you course you could say, ""Don't make a film, if it won't follow the original sources accurately."" But this is what western directing is for you, they always change and modify original concepts, but that doesn't mean it makes something inevitably bad.Mulan is an entertaining movie with a strong common message. I love action, I love historical-fantasy, and you should give this a watch, and don't waste your time reading negative reviews like what I just did 2 hours ago before watching the film because they are all ""cringe"" and only have 1 goal, to review bomb a film out of pure hatred. I went watching this show to find out what to hate about, and all I was left was being entertained and reminded about certain virtues while questioning what is there to hate about exactly? People just love to nitpick and complain to stir up unnecessary drama, and the negative feedback about this film shows that.Enjoy."
584,"Disney, please stop making garbage for this world, you're polluting not just with plastic toys and products of this horrible film, but visually polluting our minds.
Disney has patented almost every character from European folklore stories, now they move into Asia to ruin it all, they have good content, expert martial artists, great digital artist together with the best technology in the world and all they do is pure trash, and trash movies?
How can you have so many creative people and no ideas with such horrible stories?!
You have to try hard to mess up so often, at this point you're abusing your fan base. Disney stopped caring a long time ago!"
585,"If you're expecting this movie to be anything like the animated classic released in 1998 then you will be disappointed. There are no musical numbers or goofy magical sidekicks to offer up comic relief. Instead, Disney chose to create a more ""realistic"" Mulan for this live action film.If you're looking for a film with beautiful visuals and cool action choreography that you can probably watch with your entire family to pass the time while eating dinner then this movie is OKAY. If you're looking for more engaging and heartfelt film then it will certainly fall short though. The cast is attractive and talented but the story and direction is very lackluster and missing the true essence of the original fable.Mulan is the story of an ordinary Chinese girl who broke away from tradition to save her father and protecting her family's honor. It a powerful story of strong female protagonist who finds love and overcomes adversity to eventually save her country. Unfortunately, this journey and struggle is mostly lost in the new live action film since the main protagonist already has mystical energy which gives her superhuman abilities from the beginning of the film.You can watch this movie while talking with family and friends over dinner and not miss much by tuning in every now and again. The story is predictable (even more so with the new changes) and a missed opportunity overall. Just a pretty picture but not much more than that."
586,"Disney, all you had to do was remaking a great animated movie.You did not have to cope with animals that could not express emotions (what ruined the Lion King remake) - you had a great story, featuring realistic people, armies...But no, instead of using your own original story, someone definitely had to replace interesting, developing character with a completely boring Mary Sue that is so powerful that she could fight the whole army (that reminds me of one other franchise destroyed by Disney).In the original story we had a real girl, who had to struggle a lot to keep up with the men's world and succeeding thanks to her strong will. Here? We have simply nothing, a bland and boring story with main character being so bloody unrealistic that you don't really care what will happen next because it's obvious that everything will be fine in the end.Don't waste your money on this thing. Give a message to Disney that they forgot what a good movie is."
587,"Uyghur aside, Mulan is a pile of crap whatsoever on its own merit. The sheer amount of stupidity is staggering. How on earth could somebody possibly shoot this GARBAGE. Whoever pays 30$ watching this, go get a doctor ASAP."
588,"A completely meaningless pretentious movie.if this movie was to release during normal time, no one would want to go and watch."
589,"Trailer was good
Movie is Bad
No point in watching"
590,"It's like they actually tried to ruin the story. This embarrassment of a flick is full of plot holes, inaccurate in every way to the animated movie. The peasants are all dressed in vivid colors , the emperor of a kingdom ? What's with the phoenix ? Why is mulan portrayed like a superhero with ""chi powers"" ??
Why the army follows mulan to the emperor like dogs ? What's with that witch ? Disney really screwed up things really bad with this one ..."
591,"China apparently doesn't like Mary Sues. Or is it Mulan Sues? Good for Disney. They managed to piss off Western AND Eastern audiences. Truly historic and inclusive.
They of course won't learn a single thing from it."
592,The animated version is my favourite Disney movie so I was so excited to watch this. But this was one of the WORST movies I've ever seen. Terrible acting. No real flow. Cheesy. Boo! Waste of money
593,Very poor movie. Very bad movie. The history is distorted. The acting is bad. inconsistent. much worse than the animation
594,"I struggle to find something nice to say about this movie. It was a dull experience to say the least. This movie manages to make a huge country like China feel like a small place. The actors didn't show much emotion, and the characters seemed to make decisions and change their minds on a whim. The creature effects seemed fake, and even the action was awkward and didn't make much sense. The movie introduces a new important character but they have a dissapointingly predictable path. In general, this movie is much less believable than even its fully animated counterpart and made me wish I was watching that instead."
595,"This movie is not a Mulan adaptation, it lacks humor at all, no songs, not a single joke or funny moment at all!, just boring drama with a new witch character and uninspiring in every way , only reason I give 2 stars is because of visuals department, costumes and scenarios are nice. But apart from this, it is super bad and boring and just not a worthy homage to the original."
596,"Lacking everything from its inspiration- probably the worst live action adaption I've seen in a good while, which is a shame because Mulan had been one of my favorites. Not to mention all of the gross political implications Disney has gotten itself into with China. This may very well be my last Disney movie.."
597,"The childern liked it,.But its a cringe movie. Its like they just added together bits & pieces of the animated version to their story line. The story line is not smoothThe movie would be better if given to the right director. Great casts though, In my own opinion. its kind of a waste of a greatcasts.Great music video at the end."
598,We selected this as one weekend movie for the whole family. Four of us all loved it. Kids like the story and I particular like the performance from Yifei Liu. I would recommend it.
599,"In medieval China, Mulan (Yifei Liu) grew up as a rambunctious daughter with vast reserves of qi. Her father is secretly proud but her mother is concerned with her marriage potential. In the north along the silk road, Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) leads the Rouran warriors on a revenge mission for his late father with the help of the witch Xianniang (Gong Li) who uses her qi for evil. She is able to shapeshift and convinces the Emperor of China to conscript one male from each family. Mulan's father prepares to join the Army despite his old injuries. Mulan steals his armor and takes his place. She pretends to be a man while training under Commander Tung (Donnie Yen).This is a live action remake of the 1998 animated movie. There are choices being made that I understand but about which I'm uncertain. First and foremost, it's the lost of Mushu. While I completely understand the ridiculous problem of Mushu, this version is missing the comedy that Eddie Murphy delivered in the animated version. Somehow, Mulan needs a traveling companion to give comedic relief. It can't be a ghost due to government dictates. My only possible solution is a horse with an inner voice. That may be controversial but the movie needs comedy badly. Another issue is the use of qi which struck me as bringing Star Wars Force into Mulan. I am uncertain with this choice. I'm also confused with Xianniang's motivations. I don't understand her pushing the Emperor into instituting the draft. I don't understand her character during much of the third act. I don't understand her ultimate goals and her actions in driving the story. There are some bad action premise like when the soldiers turtled to hide from the attacking birds. I don't understand that they would be huddling together to give the trebuchet perfect targets. Also, trebuchets are not that accurate. Quite frankly, they really only need to be pinned down by arrow barrages. Mulan should be at the top of the mountain after chasing the mounted soldiers and confronting Xianniang. That way she would be in a position to start the avalanche by pushing a boulder down the mountain. Time and time again, the action scenes feel wrongly constructed like having too many cooks in the kitchen. This movie has various issues but non of them are deal-breakers."
600,"True masterpiece, every actor has done their part perfectly. The breathtaking visual n action sequence will blown you away. You have to watch the movie with a fresh perspective of Mulan don't compare it with the animation. Thoroughly enjoyed."
601,"If you were hoping to see Donnie Yen and Jet Li break into song - you will be disappointed. If you were looking to see romance, you will be disappointed. If you were looking for a funny dragon, well....Just watch the cartoon.However, if you want to see Disney's unique take on martial arts films and Chinese folklore and culture, then you will be delighted in every way. If you're looking for a strong female lead, everybody was kung-fu fighting, and a meaningful story about self-discovery, honor and family, (that is very Chinese) then this will be a fun movie.I'm giving it 9 stars because a part of me did miss the cartoon, from 1998, which was 22 years ago. Let's just say watching the same exact thing, shot for shot, while nostalgic, is always going to fall short of the original. Kudos to Disney for surprising us with something new, and a character that is both meaningful to the new audience, and still captivates us old-timers like when we were children.Also - costumes, locations, character development, music score, fight choreography (anyone who grew up watching 70s Wu-Tang and 90s martial Arts movies will LOVE this movie), many of these elements made it a Mulan to remember."
602,"Don't even try to compare this to the animated version. Why try to copy a great kid's movie? This version is an original unto itself. The tone, plot points, acting, and substance having purpose and provide a deep, gorgeous movie. I watched it twice and it just got better for me. I feel this script is much more thoughtful and meaningful. One key example, is the small but deep difference in the way Mulan reveals she is a woman. In this version, she decides to fight as a woman instead of being discovered while unconscious. It shows more purpose and agency on her part. The characters around her react to her decision, and not to their own findings. This subtle change in storytelling is powerful to young and old audiences. I applaud this version of the movie."
603,"I've always loved Mulan. The cartoon has always been my favorite movie. While this didn't come across in a totally new way, and had some differences, the differences didn't detract. It may not have been super forward thinking, but was enjoyable. I can't speak for the political stuff that is going on with it/the actors and locations, because I've not lived or researched it enough, but I know that it is a painful and difficult situation, but again I chose not to voice an opinion on something I know little about, it is enjoyable movie from the surface. But the issues that have been raised surrounding the politics should not be ignored and they should discussed in a healthy way that brings awareness and change to the situation."
604,"This is a legit, well acted and written and directed film. Idk yalls issue but I'd imagine it's with the concept of Xi (chi) and Chigong and the extranatural license the story tellers HAVE Always taken with a masters capabilites proficient in 'harnessing' Xi - don't be diks yall, it's a solid film"
605,"To say the movie was mildly entertaining is to be very gracious. I have certainly watched movies that were far worse but for a major blockbuster I truly expected more.This movie kept the plotline similar to the original but cut all of the heart, the comedy and the songs that made the cartoon magical.Why would you cut Mushu (the best part of the cartoon) but then have a witch who can transform into an eagle? Either make this a believable/realistic reimagining of the story or keep the fantasy with the best characters from the original.The casting was actually pretty poor as well, as why spend the money to cast Jet Li when he is barely recognizable and did almost no martial arts. Jason Scott Lee looked terrible and was not very believable as an intimidating villan, I thought I was looking at an overweight Jack Sparrow everytime I saw him.The most egregious of errors though was cutting the songs that made the cartoon magical from this version. Sure they made nods to the songs but it was a major error in my opinion to leave them out.Lastly the story felt rushed, like they were trying to fit it in a tight time window and left half the scenes they filmed out as I did not feel that the recruits going from loveable losers to a lethal fighting force was given enough time which caused the entire ending to feel rushed and forced. In the cartoon I loved and could see the transformation and felt moved, in this version I felt cheated especially without the songs to accompany the training.Again this was not horrible but I will never watch this version ever again. I had to put the cartoon version on immediately after finishing this one to make sure that my opinion of the cartoon still held as I had not watched it in many years and it just reinforced my opinion that this version is far far far inferior and need not exist."
606,"Actually, when I was a kid, I like Mulan a lot. But this mulan remake is kind of disappointment. Well, all I know, disney classic was supposed to be something magical, but i didn't find any magical feeling in this Mulan 2020. There's no song, no laugh (especially for main actress, she looks gloomy and has no expression all the time from the beginning until the end of the movie, it feels totally different with Mulan at the animated movie), and totally different storyline which all over the place. Thats okay for making quite different storyline but I think the casting for the main role and the directing could have been done a bit better."
607,"The visuals are a 10/10 but the story and plot is just a disappointment, 3 at best. This is all my personal interpretation and I feel a lot will disagree with what I am going to say.What I like about the animated version of Mulan is her personality. The animated Mulan is someone who is witty, rebellious, misfit, but at the same time kind and loving daughter. In the beginning of the scene, she was writing down cheat notes on her hand and ending of the scene where all the other ladies were able to open their umbrella at the same time while Mulan had to watch them to know what to do. This scene related to me personally because I was that second grade student that was constantly behind in the class and struggle to to fit in. Mulan is kind of like me who is isn't like everyone else and struggle to fit in as bride/daughter while I struggle to fit in as a student. While in the action film the directors tried to use her sister as a comparison of how Mulan is different from other women but really fail because it just shows Mulan is different just due to her chi talent. It also doesn't really explain to me why Mulan is sad that she will get bride match make.
The next animated scene where Mulan stand up for her father and tried to reason with the guard was another powerful scene. I used to think Mulan was dumb for doing this but now I know this again reinforce her as someone who is misfit or daring of society because she think she is doing something right even though she is constantly told to know her place. It really build her character and why she would go to war for her father preparing to die. She went to war because she doesn't want her father to die and follows what she thinks is right. Whereas in the action film, Mulan was stopped by her relative and was like okay I wouldn't go. I believe even if the cartoon Mulan was stopped she will still make a scene and stand up for her father because cartoon Mulan cared more about family than reputation. The action film scene was a real disappointment because it just shows she is an obedient daughter she didn't challenge the norm. Even after she was yelled by her father she just stayed quiet and obedient. There is no dramatic scene when she decide to go to war and instead just cut to her already change in armor.
Mulan in the action felt like she is lost in her identity and needs a witch to tell him about her identity. Also, I didn't know what the phoenix was there for and later look it up to realize that was supposed to be a replacement of Mushu. Her bride make up was really ugly and make her look like a clown. I mean the court ladies make up look so much better and they could have just follow that.I felt that the action movie want a different approach of Mulan and in the end failed in execution. I feel like if they wanted to do an all mighty Mulan then it could be still done. Instead of saying she was talented because of chi they should say she was talented because she had a much bigger strength than everyone else. Instead of people calling her witch they should have the people pity Mulan's family for her wasted talent and felt that it's too bad Mulan's wasn't born as male. Mulan should play how she struggle with her strength and identify as a women and her struggle to balance both. She should have her dad help her send her to war knowing Mulan's talent in strength. Instead of him feeling regret in the movie for training his daughter. They should show her dad struggling with his own identifies by defying what's norm and letting his daughter go to war because it's the right thing for the family. They should have a scene where Mulan hides her strength because she doesn't want to get sent to the front line risking her chance of getting injured and die. Because if she gets injured or die they will find out she is a women. And they should have more scenes of her personal development with the male interest and why they like each other. Also I think the witch should be the one to reveal her identify instead of the action film where Mulan stupidly reveal herself and really brought dishonor to her family. The core message of the film should be whether she is a male or female she will stand up for what's right and be true to herself. Just like the animated cartoon,"
608,"Hi, Mulan's acting and stunts are great. She's beautiful to play Mulan as well. Just one or 2 setbacks. The storyline sucks compare to the animated film. Secondly, as Mulan she's come across as a strong warrior but you did not present those personality and you're kinda emotionless in the movies which is such a let down. Third, there no romance between you and the main actor. The original animated film romance definitely outbeat this one...last but not least, there's no song playing in the whole movie only at the end of the credit part which does not stir up emotions for those watching it. In conclusion, to me it's only worth 5/10 stars which is the lowest compare to all real life classic disney film.. beauty and the beast, Cinderella and Aladdin definitely out-beat Mulan."
609,"I did not enjoy neither did my son, I would not recommend anyone to see this movie"
610,"I've used IMDb for years to help me figure out which movies to watch. I've thought about writing a review for other movies but never have. In this case, I felt it was my duty to write my first review. This won't be much of a review but hopefully it will give some people a reason to give this movie a chance. For over a week, I held off on watching this movie because of the negative reviews. After not having very many other options and realizing that most of the negative comments were people comparing it to the story of Mulan that they know or saw in years past, I decided to put it on for Family Movie night. It was a pleasant surprise. My daughter, son, wife and I all watched it together and it kept all of our attention from start to finish, which is rare for a movie. I think my wife liked it the most because of the whole girl power thing and even clapped at the end but I also thoroughly enjoyed it. It was predictable but entertaining. I think people who fit into a similar demographic as me will also enjoy it so here is where I'm coming from....Black American male born and raised in the US, age 39, enjoy watching action movies, never watched any other version of Mulan (If i did see the animated version, I don't remember), didn't know the story of Mulan before watching this, watched this in 4k on an OLED TV"
611,"As great as Disney princess level movie, beyond my expectation as a Chinese original. They include as many as details, even those two rabbits running fast not to tell male or female. I really appreciate the director and actors paying much attention to these details."
612,"It may not be the exact same as cartoon animation version. To compare this with other live action remake such as Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin, it fight this as the best of all. The scenary are so beautiful and eye capturing. Every Liu YiFei's martial arts moves are beautiful, grace and aesthetics (even though some use string). The values imparted in it are very meaningful. Even though few parts might not as good as satisfying but still considered very good."
613,"I enjoyed this new and more realistic movie version of Mulan. While I greatly enjoyed the cartoon movie, I thought this movie was beautiful to watch and entertaining. I do think that a household with just 1 person might not think it's worth paying the $30 on Disney Plus. I have a family of 5 and so it was worth it. But, the $30 price tag will be high for small families. But, I did like it. I wish there had been more character development where you actually see Mulan learn her skills because she is portrayed as a young girl as a do-it-all girl with special abilities. I think it would have been nicer to see a normal girl with courage who teachers herself the skills needed to be a warrior. But overall, I liked the movie."
614,"Liu Yifei has almost no acting skills. In the whole movie, she only has one expression, and Mulan was acting dumbfounded by her. I really want to ask Liu Yifei, can't your eyes turn? Are you acting or taking pictures? But this film also has its own success, that is, Liu Yifei successfully interprets Mulan as ""wood"", which can be said to be ""stunned as Mulan."""
615,"Typical super china hero killing all the bad guy.
The violate is good enough because the main actor is women. Kids won't learn fighting from the movie because Mulan's Kung Fu is boost by magician.
Excellent production."
616,"Hold on. I'm not saying that is good or bad. Disney is in the entertainment business and so if there's a market for this then who am I to criticize their business strategy. But, being from the US it's not what I would expect and not nearly the entertainment standard I would expect. It's more like something made overseas, dubbed but not translated for cultural differences and expectations. Lost in translation. How do you measure that? I don't know but judging from the feedback from audiences so far, disney doesn't either or they didn't test in the US or they made this for chinese audiences. My kids are grown now but when they were little I didn't think twice about taking them to see the original. But, if they were that age now, I wouldn't let them watch. They wouldn't understand the story that well and too much violence."
617,Why does Disney feel the need to make the live action remakes of their classic feels so...bland? Where were the songs? The enjoyment? So disappointing.
618,"The reviews were so bad that I was hesitant to watch the movie. But it was much better than I expected it to be. The cinematography was beautiful. The story, though a bit simplistic, hit the right emotional notes. The movie captured especially well the relationship between father and daughter. If you like father-daughter flicks, this is definitely for you! The action scenes were also well done. If you go into the movie expecting to see a remake of the animated film you will be disappointed. But the movie can stand alone on its own merit."
619,"Dear Disney,I already had Disney+ and you made us pay an extra 30 bucks on top of our subscription to watch this movie.Now, if you're gonna charge 30 bucks for people to watch a movie, the movie better be so good that I end up raving about it for years to come. But instead, you wasted my money, time, and left such a bitter taste in my mouth.There were the very, very few good things I can pick apart from this movie, but a grand majority of this movie is a cesspool.So here are the 'good' things about this movie-
-NO SONGS! No opportunity to BUTCHER the classic songs we love. THANK YOU!
-The actor for Mulan's dad was great. Probably the best actor of the entire thing.
-Cinematography looked good. Plenty of frame shots I would definitely make into a screensaver if I wanted to.
-Costume design was beautiful.And that's all the good I can really lay down.This movie tried to take itself so seriously, that it turned into a joke. And not a funny one at that. There were moments where I burst out in sudden laughter at how ridiculous some things were. Basically, for the people that don't know, this movie is not trying to replicate it's animated source. It's trying to adapt the original Chinese folk song/ballad about Mulan. So the original implication was that there would be no magic, no slapstick comedy, no musical moments. A serious and meaningful war movie. Did we the viewer get any of that in the one hour and 50 minutes we were watching this?Nope. The acting was flat, the plot was a mess, suspension of belief out the window in probably less than 30 minutes because they added a certain subplot last minute that tried to make sense but just confused me even more than I already was about the movie. The fight choreography was not all that impressive. Some of it laughable. And lastly, there's genuinely no heart to this movie. It's such a blatant cash grab, and I'm annoyed that yet another one of my favorite Disney classics got a live action reboot where they butchered everything.I'm actually making count now. So far, we've had live action reboots of Cinderella (decent), Jungle Book (fine), Beauty and The Beast (Awful), Aladdin (Awful), The Lion King (Atrocious), and now Mulan (Awful).Strap in your seats fellas. Next is live action Little Mermaid.Until then, all I can say to Disney and Bob Igher is, DISHONOR ON YOU, DISHONOR ON YOUR COW! Wasted my money for yet another piss poor live adaption. STOP with the live action remakes and make NEW original stories.Save your money people. Go watch the original Mulan on repeat with your kids. I know I surely needed to do so to recover from this waste of my time.4/10 stars. For a big budget movie, it deserves to be a Direct-to-video movie if I had to be honest."
620,"Ignore the 35 year old's who are mad they didn't get a talking dragon and a paint by numbers nostalgia trip. This is a retelling of the ballad of Mulan, not a retelling of a 90's kids movie. Never trust a reviewer who goes into a movie with preconceived beliefs on what a movie should be. But alas, it's human nature.This movie has wonderful acting, great visuals and a wonderful story about Chinese traditions and beliefs. I'ts also action packed and inspiring to young girls. Check it out, ignore the trolls. Let them get back to their nonstop sequels and rehashes."
621,"First, sorry for my English I'm from Brazil.I always follow the imdb and even discard films with low scores. However, I will no longer follow the rating. There are people who take nothing into account, only their opinion of how the film should be made. These experts are ruining this. The film is great, good performances, good special effects and I thought the story was well adapted. That was my first comment on the site. I hope people like me, watch the movie."
622,"Disney films are often targeted towards kids, but Mulan is a story that has been known for many years now and I understand why Disney felt the need to also stylise this movie in such a way that it would be enjoyable for adults who grew up with this story as well. However, I feel that Disney has completely failed by not adding enough in multiple areas to critique.The plot 1/10:
I went into this movie blind and didn't know about whether Disney chose to change the plot or not. Jumping right in however, it was clear immediately the plot would be drastically changed. Mulan is shown to have powerful skills already rather than training to become powerful. I kept myself open to this idea, however, in retrospect I see this choice of change as a cop out from Disney in terms of creating any real plot progression or character development in this film. Characters aren't developed well... names of characters are not even memorable. Supporting characters felt as if they were used only to bring about nostalgia. For example, Yoson An's role as a newly introduced character, a rival recruit to the character of Mulan, appears in the lake which Mulan washes herself. However, this scene doesn't feel deserved with the fast progression of the plot and simply felt inserted in to create nostalgia for adult viewers.Just as a side thought... Some people may also bring up the point of the phoenix in this film. I believe there is symbolism of rebirth for Mulan with the use of a phoenix instead of Mushu, but would kids be able to make this link themselves?Action 3/10:
Big name action stars Donnie Yen and Jet Li bring about a lot of promise for the action scenes in this movie. Donnie Yen suits his role as the training commander well displaying his skills beautifully. However, Jet Li being the emperor displaying skills felt out of place. Overall, the direction of action scenes in this movie felt promising at first where scenes such as running up walls felt homage towards traditional Chinese action film. However, I was thoroughly disappointed with the choice of no blood or visible injuries. This is probably a choice to keep this film suitable for children but I feel this takes away the intensity of the action. In conclusion, my opinion on the action in this film is that although there is good choreography, I am disappointed with the visual effect choices Disney has gone with. Simply not enjoyable as an adult viewer. However, what really makes my rating of the action not even have a pass mark of a 5/10 is that some scenes just feel extremely illogical. Why did the witch need to throw herself in front of the arrow for Mulan? Why did Mulan have to close the doors behind her as she headed towards the emperor? Why does the enemy commander jump on top of the beam, balancing out the beam and allowing Mulan to climb back up?Sountrack 0/10:
Don't expect any singing. My opinion is that characters bursting out in song is unique and core to the image of Disney films. I'm sure both kids and adults would have appreciated any inclusion of music. I don't know if this was a choice made due to political correctness due to the nature of some of the original Mulan movie's songs.This is my first review thanks for reading if you did."
623,"I came to this film with no expectations but I was disappointed nonthless.
While I thought this movie will be good based on the first scenes with mulan (until she fights the rourans), the premise with the rourans and the super natural didn't do it for me.
Some of the action was cool and good but for the most it was over the top and unbelievable (for me).
The family dynamics, and the 'girl-pretends-to-be-soldier' was what I enjoyed. But unfortunately a big chunk of the film revolves around the rourans etc... which I didn't like.
Aaaand alot of the writing is very on the nose - yes yes, it's disney, but no.
For conclusion, the movie had potential, but I didn't like the way it turned out."
624,I had so much hope for this film. There is too much to say about the faults of this adaptation. I hope the CCP confiscates this movie for defamation.
625,"This movie had potential, it had a good story and some good actors. Felt like I was watching the last season of game of thrones tho... bad writing, bad acting and bad bad..."
626,The costume is good. The look of the movie over all is good. And that is it. The story is so incomplete and meaningless that it's just another Disney princess cliche with a Chinese cover on top of it. Save ur money and time for better things. Also don't watch it cuz it's gonna ruin your good memory of the 1998 Mulan.
627,"At the start, it was too exaggerated. The stunts were poorly made because they were seen so fake. The home of Mulan was different from the real story. In this movie, she is from a very poor family in a Hakka fort! This fort is too new to be even in the Mulan old ancient story. Hakka forts are not even anywhere old enough to match the time difference. Then in this home part of the story, there were so many lousily made stories.
How can 12 men soldiers conquer a city fort? The director thought city armies only consist of a few soldiers? These directors don't even know what they were doing!
Even when the 12 gang enemy re-routed, it was nonsense to chase in that direction where home soldiers' bows and the enemy big troops are in the same places. Other big nonsenses were in the avalanche that Mulan is faster than a big avalanche and enemy is too foolish to change shooting at big armies but to shoot at a few soldiers with a cannon!
Many nonsenses jokes were shot at the palace too because no armies were missing guarding at the fort. These directors seemed never seen any China palace walls because they do not know the walls are also pathways!
I cannot give this movie a normal start because Disney is a very big movie maker with very big budgets. When a so big movie company had made so many big flaws, it should be condemned for wasting customers money and time. The actors are good but the movie was so badly directed."
628,I sense a lot of political agenda in this adaptation. there is not much of humor thrown in as there is a lack of a character named mushu. i don't recommend this version to parents.
629,"After watching Mulan 2020, I immediately put on the animated version and felt so much better.This has to be a joke. Mulan is born with magic chi that makes her naturally awesome at everything. Wow, what an inspiring message. The new villain is a shapeshifting witch who has no character arc, more like a character 180. There is no humor, no heart, and hardly anyone expresses emotion. Jet Li's Emperor could have been a wax figure with a CGI mouth and nobody would know the difference. This is ""Mulan"" with every last drop of humanity wrung from every last scene.If you want to see a good Mulan movie, watch the animated one, or even China's own version from 2009. If you want to see a good Chinese movie, watch Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, or Jet Li's Hero. But don't waste your money on this empty shell of a movie."
630,"Plain and simple ... got 4 White writers to script an ancient Chinese folktale ... and wonder what went wrong ... keep it to the silly cartoons, or actually hire people from the culture to write their own narratives... DUH, Disney ... you'll see in the end that the world is tired of having outsiders write their stories. Want authenticity? What us to buy it? Keep it real ... which isn't a screenplay by LTGBQI Hollywood/American insiders"
631,We all agree is not a good movie. But is not that bad if you try to not compare with the original movie.
632,"People who disregard this adaptation of Mulan express the lack of music and Mushu but honestly take it for what it is. It is a retelling of the original Mulan tale (not the animated movie) and for what it is it's a pretty good movie but obviously not as good as the animated one. And before you watch this movie just take into account that this is NOT a retelling of the animated movie. And if you can get past the lack of mushu, music, and Mulan basically being a badass from the start then it's a pretty good movie. (Still not worth the $30 bucks) but otherwise I'd recommend"
633,"After I watched the whole movie, I was only entertained no more. I don't really feel it, to be honest I have forgotten the storyline which is the 1998 version. But I like it that there are no musicals that are usually synonymous with Disney films."
634,"Just don't bother, nothing worth seeing here that isn't 10 times better in the original. Certainly not worth paying for."
635,"Out of all the Disney live action remakes, this is the worst. This movie is boring. The characters are not likeable and if this movie was released at the box office it would have bombed.
The original has a lot of heart and character development and this version has neither. It gives you no reason to care about Mulan, she's just naturally an amazing warrior who needs little training (because these days female Disney characters have to just be perfect at everything.) This movie was made to satisfy no one and Disney is in desperate need of better leadership."
636,It is time for Disney and Hollywood to fall. Creatively bankrupt and to afraid to criticise evil.
637,"Special effect is up to par with other Disney pictures. The problem is the acting of Mulan actress. She has may be a total of 5 expressions through the whole movie. One cannot feel her fear, anxiety, determination and bravery. This acting deficit is to some extent helped by the supporting cast. Another disappointment is Gong Li. It is a waste of her talent to portray a one dimensional villain. Overall, it is not worth the $30 plus Disney + fee to watch it. Wait till it is free. You won't miss much."
638,If you think that you are going to watch something similar to the classic Mulan don't waist your time. It is a good movie with good action which is why I gave it a 1. But it is nothing like the original that we all saw growing up. So sad that Disney dropped the ball on such a classic. Missing main characters and changing scenes through the whole movie. Again very sad and disappointed.
639,"I tried, I really tried. I am a HUGE Disney fan and I was so excited for this. Visually, it is beautiful. Characters and Story, suffers greatly. It'll give you some sort of storyline that's close to the animated film. But it will disappoint you. I can't believe the 10 star reviews, it's just not entertaining. If you like it, great. But this is one film that I can't wait to forget."
640,"Mulan (the original animated) has always been a personal favourite of mine, from the witty jokes and comments of Mushu to the plot empowering equality between a highly divided target audience of the time.
The motion picture remake (Mulan 2020) was outstanding in many ways but uncomparable to the original at the same time. Disney took on a much more mature approach with the live action remake and I think it worked well. Lion King showed us that frame by frame remakes were not going to work well and I think that this movie found a sweet spot (still not without its faults).
At times the movie did seem bland and lost character, I personally was not a fan of how disney portrays Mulan as more of a ""super hero"" rather than the intelligent witty female lead she was in the original.
What did work well - a lot more than I was expecting. Originally I was not very happy about the idea of Mushu no longer being in the movie but after watching the story arch and the clearly more mature audience nature the movie is targeted for I can completely see why this decision was made. The soundtrack has to be one of the best that Disney has ever done, personally I would place it above some of the more ""singy"" disney originals however others may differ. The movie also holds my highest respects in terms of cinematography, choreography however in parts the CGI just felt a bit off for me - however still not awful.
I would recommend this film to friends and family, however I would recommend they use my account rather than paying the £19.99 early access fee in the UK (nice one disney)."
641,"There's going to be a lack of good reviews for a while because of how off the raters are.First, you shouldn't be rating Disney making you pay for this. That does an injustice to the movie's actual review. And it's not about watching it on a TV screen instead of the theater.Second, please understand that these remakes aren't replacing the originals. There's no way they can. The originals are masterpieces. I wouldn't want anyone to make live action copies of them.So, this movie is not the best. It felt rushed at times. Then there's these epic moments that were very emotional. They did add some political correctness to it. But it didn't feel overdone. I have to admit I was a bit disappointed not having any musicals. I was at least hoping for Reflection. But despite the lack of music, my family and I enjoyed it. We'd watch it again.Oh, the fight scenes were great!"
642,"Just finish streaming on Disney+ and I love it so much! As a Chinese who's also been exposed a lot to western and Disney culture, I love both how the original animated version and how the live-action 2020 take in a different way. The live-action 2020 is epic and more feminized in my opinion. The action scenes are without doubt spectacular, the emotions are also well elaborated. Mulan and her father, Mulan and Honghui, Mualn and Xianniang...I love the way they interact and the meanings behind it. I wish Disney would also consider re-release it in theaters and it surely deserves!!!!"
643,"Out of all the remake live actions movies this is by far the best!!
Sure it didn't have the singing and mushu BUT the movie was great!!I watched it being OPEN MINDED and I loved it. I love how it empowers women in a time that they were told to be silent. Women can have talents too, and if it's for a good cause why not support.
That's what Mulan shows us, a women with talent, one used it for good and one for bad. And we see the outcomes but mulan exceeded all expectations!Watch it with an open mind!"
644,"People down rating this film without even seeing it can do one.It's lovely, visually stunning and more than enough to stand on its own while it is paying tribute to the original AND the original ballad in lots of little ways."
645,"I saw both good and bad reviews of Mulan before it came out. I reserved judgement until i saw it because im a skeptic about reviews. I have now seen it and moved it to the top of my favorite All time Disney movies. I thought the characters rich and the story line wonderful. It teaches that redemption is never to late to be had, and that loyalty , bravery, and Truth are hard but have the best reward. I thought it magnificent."
646,"Me and my family enjoyed this movie. Worth the time, worth the money. The fighting scene was remarkable!!"
647,"Seriously one of the best films by Disney. There are so many things to be admired in this movie. But for me, the biggest takeaway is that faith in yourself & others can take you a long way. It does make a big difference when people start to believe in you, but first you have to believe & be true to yourself. MUST WATCH!"
648,"...except there's no music in this one, so just forget about that. The composer wrote some of the iconic songs into the score, but nobody actually sings in the film, which is a real shame. One of the best things Disney always had going for it was the music that accompanied their films. However, the way the film is set up makes it flow pretty easily without the music. It wold be a little off-putting if, in the environment they established with this film, the characters started singing. So as much as I love the original's songs, I'm okay to go without them in this one.
This film doesn't capture the same spirit as the original, and I think it's unfair for anyone to expect it to. It's not a shot for shot remake like The Lion King was (thank god for that), rather it's a different, more straightforward interpretation of the source material. It's about as inessential as any of the Disney remakes, but that doesn't make it a bad movie.
The acting is a little wooden and the character development is definitely underdone, which is a downside to the film. As I was watching, there were quite a few moments that felt like they needed a little bit more work, a little more quality in the writing. The lead actor isn't particularly strong in the role, lacking believable expression, which is joked about a little bit at the beginning, although I know for a fact they weren't doing it to poke fun at her. It feels like she's definitely trying her best, but there's not enough for her to really work on.
And we need to talk about one of the big controversies in this film: the removal of Mushu. How people found that character lovable or even charismatic is beyond me. Eddie Murphy in Mulan gave nothing more than an early rendition of what would become Donkey. Mushu was the same annoying, loud-mouthed, disposable character as Donkey, and it was a headache to watch his performance. In my review for the original Mulan I tried my best to be level-headed and fair in my discussion on Murphy but now, seeing story work well enough without him, it only drives home how bland he is as an actor and how annoying his character was. He was the goofy ""comic relief"" in the same way Robin Williams was in Aladdin: neither role was particularly ""good"" or ""memorable"" in my personal opinion, but they gave just enough to expand the runtime a little bit. The animated film needed it.
This one did not. As a matter of fact, this Mulan runs about 30 minutes too long. It comes down to fine-tuning the story to best suit your intended audience, which is something that Disney used to be really good at but has really jumped the gun on in recent years. There's nothing at all wrong with longer films, even for children, but the film needs to do something meaningful with that time. There's no point in doing a 2 hour movie if a half-hour of that is pointless exposition (the witch... why?) that really doesn't do a whole lot for the plot. There were a lot of ""check the time"" moments throughout this film.
I think it's easy going into a movie with such heated controversy behind it to view it as a negative thing immediately, even when it's not necessarily warranted. This film is far from perfect, but it needs to be viewed separately from the insurmountable controversies that accompany it (I'm beginning to believe this production was cursed), as well as the source material. As I said, it's not shot-for-shot, it takes the original film, harvests the best of what it had to offer and attempts to add its own flare to the story. Whether it worked or not is entirely up to the individual viewer (with every remake, the responses are going to be particularly divisive), but this one just worked for me. It's far from my favorite Disney movie and it's not something I would regularly watch, but it's also not something I regret paying for. I appreciate the time, effort and hard work the filmmakers put into this movie."
649,"This movie is so well done, the cast is great, the effects are awesome , and it is so beautiful! Highly recommend it!"

655,This movie is very decent and completely fine family / teenage oriented movie. Highly recommend it!
656,Great entertainment. Good family movie. I don't remember the cartoon version so I'm not going to complain and give it a bad review. Just pretend you didn't see the original cartoon version and be entertained. Ignore the bad reviews and enjoy a good movie.
657,"Ok. So full disclosure, I've never seen the animated version of Mulan. Terrible I know.
So my viewing of the live action adaption was a compete blind watch.
And to be honest, all the negative reviews made me nervous going in.
But what a pleasant surprise.
Sure, Mulan herself didn't convey a lot of emotion, not until the final scenes of the movie. I get that as a complaint. But the actress did a fine job. It was her character. And this is a reimagining, not a remake.
Overall though, I found this to be a thoroughly engaging and entertaining film.
Fantastic set design, costuming, score and some really cool fight scenes.
Yeah. Lots of wires involved, but I went with it.
This movie entertained me from beginning to end and even managed to evoke a little tear out of me at the end.
Great fun.
Female empowerment.
Great Chinese cast.
Rousing entertainment.
Give it a chance."
658,"If you are going into the movie with a preconceived notion that it is going to be like the cartoon you won't like it! I feel this is possibly Disney's best live action movie they have made based on the cartoon, since they made it its own movie! My children were disappointed when they read all the negative online reviews, but with myself having almost 1500 movie collection and seeing 1000's more movies I told them to watch the movie for what it is and act like you have never seen the cartoon! Of course Dad was right and they loved the movie! Take it for what it is, it's own movie and stop comparing it to a cartoon which I own both Mulan and mulan 2!"
659,"But my family love this movie. Sure it doesn't have the typical Disney sing-a-song, it doesn't have the Disney touch, it felt more like a hong kong flick than anything. You got Jet Li, Donnie Yen and Jason Scott Lee, all the best Chinese martial artists actors, what can go wrong? The story, action, sceneries and characters were perfect in the movie. I watched this at home in 4K with Dolby Atmos, looked and sound amazing. There are talks of a sequel, definitely watching this in the theater next time!!"
660,"Unlike the live version of the Beauty and the Beast (2017) in contrast to its animated original (1991), Mulan's transformation into a live version of its original animation (1998), Disney has managed to create just as vibrant and compelling Asian story of honor, courage, truth, and devotion to family to the big screen. The animation version resulted in a rather unoriginal, comedic take of the legend of Mulan, a pale derivative of the Beauty and the Beast original. Instead this live action epic action adventure of Mulan sprawls across the lavish landscape of China. The luscious elements of the adolescent, comedic version of Asian in Golden Child (1985) or the martial art fantasy feminine features of Elektra (2005) are on full display here big time. Even though the cultural controversy with the Chinese crackdown in Hong Kong may diminish this movie's attraction, the deeper message of duty to Country and family remain intact.
In some ways, though, Mulan doesn't quite have the emotional detailed intimacy of the likes of the Chinese martial arts movie The Grandmaster (2013) nor the captivating, unique beauty of the cultural sci fi challenges of The Giver (2014), nor the epic Chinese military intensity of The Great Wall (2017), or the even more difficult cultural obstacles found in the sci fi The Host (2013). Mulan can't quite rise to the level of the all encompassing and compelling vastness and internal familial conflicts depicted in the fantasy epic The Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe (2005) or the wonderous magnificence of amazing spectacle of Alexander (2004) or the sweeping nature of the award-winning classic Lawrence of Arabia (1962). Nevertheless, the richness and vital power of Mulan is well worth seeing."
661,"If you're expecting a literal remake of the cartoon then save yourself the time and the money. It's not a remake of the cartoon.That being said, I thought they did a great job reinventing the story of Mulan, and creating a balance of theme and meaning with some action and adventure that I actually enjoyed more than the original.I think a lot of people were expecting this remake to be more like the original since several of the other Disney remakes were very similar to their cartoon counterparts. I'm sure they could have done something similar, but I'm glad they didn't. I feel like this movie is one of the few that could divert from the original and they did a great job doing so."
662,"This was fantastic. Right after I watched it, I came over to IMDb to see reviews and couldn't believe some of these reviews. One of my favorite recent Disney movies behind the first malevolent. Oh well, to each their own."
663,Be gentle...Do you expect another white-washing? Not this one...Go and watch Mulan 90s...Reviewers giving bad rating are the one who are soulless..just so you know my daughters love this movie and the original too...so what's your problem...get a life....stuck in your head...it's creative entertainment...
664,This was wonderful!!! Yes it's not the original BUT that is the point!!!! Thank you Disney!! I hope there is a second one!!! I love the changes and the fact that it was made differently!! 2 Thumbs up. I'm glad I bought this!!
665,"MulanThis was very good but not great, it lacked humour and much of the nuance of the original was missing. But to be fair it was, overall, very entertaining, well acted and a feel good movie.The cinematography was ravishing and the music was great whilst not having the songs tunes of the original.This was certainly written for older viewers but it was still a family movie.I give this a hard 7"
666,"Introduction: Mulan is a movie that talks about a girl, Mulan, join the army in the place of her father. In the past, womon is to be lady, they can't learn material arts.Thesis statement: Mulan's bravery, Mulan's loyalty, Mulan's truthMulan's bravery: Mulan is very brave. She in place og her father to join the army because her father has am injury on his leg. Although her martirial art is not good enough, she is not afraid of war.Mulan's loyalty: Mulan is very loyalty to her lord. Although the bad which, Xianniang, ask Mulan to join her to attack the emperor, Mulan didn't agree her. After Mulan's answer, they had a fight.Mulan's truth: Actually, we all know that Mulan is a girl. However, she hide her gender and join the army in place of her father. After she fight with Xianniang, she came back to the battlefield with long flowing hair. In the end of movie, she let enryone in the war knew that she is a woman."
667,"Or I just can say it's just neutral.
I love Disney remakes! 101 Dalmatians, Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella, and more! BUT this one... uhh......I thought when the first time I knew this movie, It's gonna be exciting. But after I watched it... well, yeah... It's not really good but not terrible too. Some scenes could make me feel bored. No songs, no memorable supporting characters, it's pretty boring for me. Also the 3 words (Loyal, Brave, and True) were repeated many times, it's very cliche. But actually, I enjoyed this movie. At least the scene where Mulan's sister was scared of the spider when Mulan's matchmaker time was quite funny. I was laughing on that. Haha... And the horse still the same like the animated one.
The scenery was pretty great! The culture and the places was also great. It will be better if they added songs, dragon Mushu, and didn't added The Witch. Just keep the falcon form, not change it to become a human.I don't say this movie sucks or garbage or anything like that. It's just more boring than the animated 1998. The 1998 Mulan is the best and still better!"
668,"An undeniably beautiful cinematic experience, with rich colors, expansive shots, and a very gorgeous young lady who plays Mulan with depth and conviction. In addition, some refreshing (but not altogether effective) departures from the animated Disney film on which it is based makes Mulan one of the better Disney remakes yet, on par with last year's Aladdin, or better than it.Both Aladdin and Mulan attempt to weave in darker tones from the harsher ancient times they take from. I commend this about the films. Darkness does have a place in children's films. However both films try to mesh the impossible: gritty historical accuracy and a modern idealistic sense of female empowerment in famously patriarchal societies. What emerges are tales that are perfect in the writing, but missing emotional impact and believability because of how little resistance the female protagonists have to meet to gain their recognition. Especially true of Jasmine in the Aladdin remake, and fortunately less true of Mulan, however, Mulan suffers from the same OP (overpowerment) skills as Rei in Disney's Star Wars series. It's not much fun rooting for an underdog who doesn't have to try very hard.In this iteration, Mulan has a natural ""chi"" since childhood. She has near superhuman reflexes and ability. When she has to decide to go to battle instead of her father, why should she be afraid? As Mulan herself says, where is the courage without the fear?This Mulan remake is a good step forward for Disney to take on slightly more risks since Aladdin, giving Mulan actual enemy soldiers to kill at points, which was surprising. However, I hope that Disney can finally decide who its audience is going to be: is this a movie for kids who liked ""Frozen,"" or for the adults who grew up with the animated Disney originals, but who now watch ""Game of Thrones""? I believe that there is an in-between such as ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" however for me Disney has yet to adequately find it.Again, I do applaud Disney for its risk taking, but I do have to say the animated film is better because the Mulan of that film had more room to grow. I don't want the remakes to be the same as their counterparts, but I won't give a 10/10 like others have for a film that takes some small risks, and then backtracks with other compromises of more of the same.Gong Li's witch character wasn't really necessary or believable (she is the most non evil witch ever), but I think in the end her addition continued the legacy established by ""Frozen"" of meaningful female sacrifice. Something of a retread, but not unappreciated in a film otherwise without very much true high stakes."
669,"Don't go into this move with any expectations you'll just be disappointed. The movie does not make any sence. She has he hair up and she's a man but let's her hair down to fight and to show her true identity. Just stupid. Who would want to fight with hair in their face? She has a perfect chance to kill the witch but let's her live only for the witch to save her but after telling the ""bad guy"" that Mulan is coming after him.... Terrible! Some of the cinematography is nice so 3 stars."
670,"From its initial announcement of the live action, we knew going into this story was going to be different but nearly everyone is upset it's not a shot for shot remake of the original like lion king. Chi being described as magical powers is far too much for audiences to grasp than a talking dragon with sass. Its very unfortunate that this movie had to be released on Disney plus where our TVs and soundbars had to attempt to duplicate great cinematics and sound that we typically get from our theaters. It's not perfect but the story told still resonates with the original."
671,Although the mulan cartoon is one of my favorites this movie doesn't even deserve that name. This is a soulless feminist film that missed the point. -10 points for ruining my childhood. I can't even write about this anymore how annoyed i am if you want an hour and a half of irritations watch it.
672,Excellent and beautiful movie. Truly a masterpiece. I hope bollywood learns from this movie.
673,"Although it's not as the original, I'd still rate it good and had fun watching it. Actors played their given roles perfectly and is one of the few Hollywood movies enforcing female lead characters in action movies and so props to that.
And Liu Yifei doing most of the stunts on set proves that more females should be casted as lead in action movies"
674,I actually liked the movie. So glad it didn't have the musical number to be honest. It was very entertaining. Only thing is that I wish the fighting scenes were longer. People need to understand this IS NOT a live action of the animated. It's a live action retelling. If you can separate the two you will enjoy the movie. Very well done Disney and team on their decisions
675,What a shame they had a tremendous opportunity here such a rich story and they completely bungled it!!Have they given the movie to someone like Ang Lee it probably would've been exceptional
676,Just one word can describe this movie: terribleeeeeeeeee🤢
677,Should have stick as much as possible to the original one. Why ruin a great story/movie! Disappointed!
678,"Why? Why? Why are you trying to destroy our childhood? Wasn't enough with the Lion King? 😔 You won't stop, right? You will do Snow White too, right? OMG! You will even do Toy Story!! Shame!!"
679,"How can people criticize the comparison for a movie made in resemblance to the animated film? It's suppose to be a live remake, well obviously there will be comparison and a certain standard to meet.I came to watch this film with an open mind but:
It starts off okay, but bearing question to Mulan's skills with no training, that parkour, really?The village is a closed off circle all living cramped up? Doesn't make sense to me when I see pictures of Chinese villages with beautiful landscapes.Where is Mulan's grandmother? With the cricket? That's hilarious, why take it away? It develops into the entire story of how Mulan brings dishonor to her family but instead we have a spider that jumps.Again, the soundtracks are iconic, they're funny, powerful. Disney is all about singing and the scenery and this director took that all away.Mulan cutting off her hair to blend in with the army, where is this? Because then she has the knot and all of the sudden later in the film she removes the knot and has beautiful LONG hair. I ain't a hair stylist but this is pretty stupid.Mushu? You took away Mushu to resemble ""realism"" but instead we have a Phoenix that is utterly useless, a witch that resembles the raven which is a pointless overpowered character, and huns that run on fortress walls with a vertical incline, no ropes, nothing, just like Spiderman would (I'm literally laughing out loud at this point), and --to you gamers-- no fall damage apparently. But hey, take away Mushu.Mulan's three pals on the animated movie are gone, which those roles brought so much life into Mulan.The dialogue is dull, it's a very lazy script.Mulan's captain and captain's father are gone as well, so we don't have that possible romance between the foot soldier and the captain going on.The entire plot prior to the battle and the avalanche makes no sense. Guys, hear me out, it makes NO SENSE; Forget about what everyone has mentioned that Mulan gives chase to the cavalry and they disappear but instead finds the witch which she's constantly talking to and a dagger knocks her out to realize she has to loosen up her hair in order to have her skills back, rides back to save everyone, jumps up 20 feet into the air kicking off spears, and suddenly sneaks around somehow without being spotted to flank from behind, pop some arrows to get their attention. (Good, we're all caught up); the catapults, they're awesome, the Imperial army hunkers down like a testudo formation and suddenly there are more testudos! But they're getting annihilated by the catapults whom have superb accuracy... but... all of the sudden they launch one at Mulan whenever she gets their attention and miss? Instead hit the snow on the mountainside creating the avalanche? Okay...The entire battle develops in a rather flat landscape, but when the avalanche is approaching, no one from the Imperial army has visual of the avalanche because they're below a ridge out of nowhere??? I thought they were on testudo formation with no cover but now they're beside a ridge. OKAY.Everyone is on testudo, nobody saw what Mulan did, she gets called out and that script still makes no sense to me whatsoever.The location of the Emperor's kidnapping makes no sense. The stage after the battle is about the huns getting to the emperor to kill him but hold him hostage for who knows how long. The raven and Mulan becoming bffs make no sense, just because they're women in a movie doesn't mean they have to get along...The phoenix, like I said, nonexistent.Loyal, Brave, True. This is Mulan's script that's the only thing that makes sense.I'm done.
People, the name of the film is Mulan; if it was named the Phoenix warrior or something else then yes, this would've been acceptable kind of like the movie ""House of the flying daggers""--if this is what they were aiming for, it'd be awesome."
680,The movie started ok but when all the witch and magic comes it just sucks. What the heck with the chi? Disney trying to make a female super hero movie?The plot was just messy. A lot anti climax scene. The acting was ok but there are no character growth. The romance doesn't fit and too sudden. The jokes are awful.
681,"Dishonor! Dishonor on your whole family! Dishonor on you, dishonor on your cow!Firstly, the message that a woman can only be successful in a man's world if she is magical.... Really? So not hard work and integrity? Just magic.Mishu is replaced by a phoenix. Such a useless substitution. If a dragon was kept, maybe. But it didn't contribute to the story.The movie uses songs from the original for background music. A blatant abuse to give a scene heart when it is devoid of any.The addition of the witch as the eagle is also pointless. Could have been more, but in it's current state it doesn't contribute at all.Lastly, the landscape and cinematography are the only things worth anything in this movie. The fighting is also pretty good."
682,"The cast was the only thing that could've saved this movie but it was over shadowed with terrible camera work, horrific writing, and awful directing/producing. The music composer had an easy job of just taking the cartoon music and remaking it classical, didn't really think it this was bad, just funny."
683,"This movie had the opportunity to be so good, but it just wasn't. The one thing that this movie has going for it is that it looks very good. There is some really great scenery in this movie, and the costumes looked pretty good. Other than that, this movie doesn't have much more going for it. The three main problems I have with this movie are: lack of a character arc for Mulan, lack of a compelling villain(s), and contradictions within the film. First off, our protagonist Mulan doesn't really grow as a person during the movie. She does make the decision to stop hiding who she is, but that's not really an investing story. From the beginning we see that Mulan is incredibly gifted, and that the only reason she can't show off her talents is because she's a girl. Her main conflict is deciding whether or not to show it. That simply is not relatable. If we got to see her grow and develop her skills, like in the animated movie, that would be a lot better. Second, the villains in this movie are not compelling. To me, this seems like the writers couldn't figure out who was the main villain. We have Bori Khan, the leader of the Rouran army, and a female witch named Xian Lang. They are mostly working together, but they don't spend much time together onscreen. This means that neither of them really stands out. In my opinion, if Bori Khan was the only villain, this would have been a much better story, and he could have been a compelling character. It would have been more like the animated version, but Shan Yu was actually quite menacing. And third, the movie contradicts itself. This movie is very different from the animated film in tone. This version decided to cut out the dragon Mushu, the comedy, and the musical numbers in order to be more realistic. I think that wasn't in itself a bad idea, and could have worked out nicely, if they had developed the characters better. However, during the movie we see people running up walls that are easily 25 feet tall, swinging curtains as deadly weapons, having people catch and kick arrows, and magic. That definitely took away the sense of realism that they were going for.
In short, this movie could have been really good, but it just wasn't. Some people may find it entertaining, but the lack of story compromised it for me."
684,"Disney has finally released the new live-action version of the 1998 cartoon Mulan.There have been multiple revisions between the old cartoon and this one, and my daughter and I both felt the audience for the new one should be (and is) an older group than the young kids of the cartoon. There's a lot more violence and it contains more of the action of a Marvel movie than a Disney.The story was good (and pretty similar to the cartoon version), and the actress who played Mulan (Yifei Liu) did an awesome job at playing Mulan! The action was there (and arrows and spears in people), and scenes were beautiful (with mostly convincing digital effects), but there a couple of problems related to this movie's release. First, this IS a ""BIG screen movie"", not a ""movie for home"", meaning the small screen of the house actually hurts the movie. The story itself was good, but something just seemed to be missing in it. A lot of character development just didn't seem to be in this movie. IMDB rates this a 5.6 (user review average at time of this writing). I'd have to agree with that. And what I've found is a movie under a 6 just isn't a great movie (a movie at a 5.6 or better is still worth seeing).... and with ""Mulan"", that's a shame because I truly believe it could have pulled about a 5.9 to 6.0 if release on the big screen (at least al little better).This is a first time saying this, but I would NOT watch this on TV or through Disney+, but WAIT to see if it does come to the big screen!! You will certainly like it better with the full impact of the large visuals and a great audio system of a theater than on a 52"" LED TV at home! This movie seriously was NOT produced for the small screen. I wish Disney had waited to release this at theaters first.I give this a 5.6 and suggest it's really NOT for kids under about 10 years old. And PLEASE wait to see this AT A THEATER! If you see it at a theater, I promise you'll walk away much more impressed than watching it at home. It is NOT worth $30 on Disney+! (I seriously wished I had NOT watched it on my 52"" OLED TV but waited to see at a theater (assuming they might still release it at theaters)."
685,"It was not bad, there were some changes from the animation that i didn't enjoy, but there were many good scenes. For example, the camp scenes, they were the most interesting and fun part for me. Moreover, the cinematography was very beautiful. I really enjoyed the first half of the movie, the second half was not bad also, so overall, i think it was a fun movie to watch, not as great as the animated mulan, but still enjoyable."
686,Chinese culture filmed from the perspective of Westerners. It is very boring and awkward to apply the story of an European castle to the Chinese.
687,"I dont understand the low ratings. I found it both Enjoyable and moving at times. Also really loved the lead actress! Worth the time for me, although the original is my favorite."
688,"I enjoyed this film, much like the live action Aladdin it followed a similar storyline as the cartoon but with some slight twists here and there which were enjoyable as it meant you weren't watching a play by play of the original just with actual actors. I especially enjoyed the addition of Xianniang. Although this film differs from Aladdin in that it is not a musical and it takes on a much more kind of serious dramatic tone but all the while remaining thoroughly enjoyable for all ages. Really enjoyed it and will happily watch again."
689,Lots of special effects and very little character development. The entire movie felt very meh. Don't waste your money.
690,"Mulan is my favourite movie and I was really excited about the live action. First 10minutes of the movie made me sooo angry. Firstly, she is a fighter with chi what the hell? Mulan was clumsy and she didn't know she can fight well. Then they live in some sort of slums when Fa Family was quite popular in the original movie and had massive house, very disappointing with mushu missing and the songs. LIKE COME ON THERE IS NOT ONE SONG. And Mulan has a sister as we all know she had a little brother which was her dog but okay she got a sister. There is non one scene from the original movie at all. Everything is changed I regret that I spend my money on it. I hope Disney is going to get rid of this and make a proper Mulan movie"
691,"The subtitles were corny, acting was stiff, storyline is illogical. A film made by very lazy scriptwriting and directing. You can't just throw cgi into a movie and hope that it will succeed."
692,"The film lacked soul. Mulan's sacrifice for her family was underplayed. It lacked emotions and there was barely any relationship development. The emotional connection between characters in the animated version was far more intense. Even considering that it was a serious movie based on the original story, it could have had some lighter moments. People are just aware of Mulan, the cartoon. They had expectations, given that the animated version was loved by all. I honestly, missed mushu, and general and Mulan's love angle; but that could be just me. So forgoing that, what I missed the most was that the failed to properly acknowledge Mulan's journey, and her sacrifices."
693,"I had to sign up for a new imdb account in order to leave a review just because of how strongly I feel about this movie. It is bad, bad, bad. As an Asian myself I was having high hopes and eagerly waited to watch Mulan. I remember seeing the beautiful trailer and tell myself I will watch Mulan as soon as it is released. This movie however has no soul. The character development is so bad it feels like every character is one dimension. I didn't even know Jet Li is the emperor - I seriously thought the emperor is some low key chinese actor. There is no scene that left an impact. Mulan is an inspiring character but the movie directing has made her into some sort of super hero - who she is not. She is a normal person who learned to fight from her father. This movie is a joke."
694,"This is a not movie like Beauty and a Beast, who is very similar to the original movie. This is a different version of Mulan. I'm very confused about this movie in comparison of animated version. For me the best and emotional moment was she showed who really her was and left to fight to her nation. But the movie have some fails and the narration was so fast that didn't convince me and the actors didn't convey emotion in their roles although the film has its moments. Even so, the movie is visible but it is so far from suprassing the classic Mulan. The movie lacked emotion, love, romance and what we all expected, Mushu. But keep in mind that the director wanted to make a more realistic version of the animated one, even so, having played even more with the fantasy and the beautiful songs that existed in the classic version of Mulan would have been great, but I loved the melody of '' Reflection '' depicted in the movie."
695,It's not good on its own or comparing it to the animation.
696,"I'm a Mulan fan.Would rate it as my number one child hood go to cartoon/movie.Though, this... what the hell was this.A strange bird has replaced Mushu. An the cricket... I didn't know one of the soliders was named cricket. Guess I'll be going back to watch the cartoon.Anyway. Here's what I thought.If you're going to compare this to the cartoon. (Which I am) than this remake gets a one star.If you want to watch this movie as a stand alone with no idea of what Mulan is (which I didn't) than you can maybe rate it 5 stars.It get's a one from me as I had such high hopes for a real life action based Mulan... I got propaganda, out takes due to sexism fears and a story that had cringe worthy action scenes"
697,I didn't saw the original yet but i liked this live action version great cinematography well Directed but weak script
698,Well to be honest I thought the movie is turning out bad i mean it wasn't that good too but it sure was breathtaking and the music really suits the film and it's a shame that the Phoenix didn't do anything he could have helped mulan while fighting or even talked to her giving her some advices I really loved the movie.
699,"I don't know, what I am reading here in the most of the reviews about some other movies or whatever, I am here for watching and reading about this one.So -- about this one.Cinematography and production quality is somewhat awesome, I haven't been to China ever yet, but if China (or both of them) looks as beautiful as portraited here, I surely want to visit.Actors are fine (by me,) I love D. Y., J. L. and other actors, that girl portraiting Mulan was fine (by me).Story is ""medicore"" at best, for me. It works, I don't have any major issues with that, it's just... you know, we were watching the Mulan with my friend at the cinema a few hours ago and we talked about it, we agreed that the most ""good things"" about this movie is lacking of bad things about a screenplay. There are a lot of thing which could go horribly wrong, but they did they right. Not great, but not terrible :-D (I had to, sorry).For me, it is great looking movie about a girl becoming who she wanted to be. It's not a movie about character development ""into"" the warrior, it's a movie about a girl warrior admitting herself she's a warrior. And it's fine by me."
700,"The comparsion between this and the 1998's animated classic is inevitable for obvious reasons. But I won't stick to that. The film itself is really, really bad and many times, it feels like an independent b movie. The plot is rushed and uninspired and the pacing/editing has LOTS of problems. Last but not least, the acting is terrible, especially the female lead, who is wooden, with no emotion and her acting skills are mediocre at best. I wonder were all the budget went ($200 million). The only good thing was the music.I don't have a problem with all these Disney live action remakes, unless they're done with love and caution like The Jungle Book. Mulan lacked both."
701,"This movie is just kind of poopy. There's no depth to any of the characters, even Mulan. We know nothing about anyone's background (except for the 3 minutes spent on Mulan being more like a warrior than a typical woman for her community). None of these characters make sense and I don't care about any of them. Usually in a movie like this the audience is supposed to root for one side or another. However, in this movie, I kind of just don't really care how the ending will turn out. I have no idea who the main antagonist really is, or why they are doing the things portrayed in this movie. Because of the lack of depth, this easily could've been shortened down to 30 minutes."
702,Loved it. My kids loved it . Very good movie. I just wish it was longer
703,The shots are amazing and so are the costumes. The story is missing some flavour however it is good nonetheless.
704,"Visually stunning, but the special effects department must have taken a day off. The special effects were not bad, but they were choppy, and lacked realism. The movie itself, well if you saw the original you have seen this one, but the story is a bit more ""woke,"" but not over the top. It was not very violent considering the context, at least my girls were OK with it (age 7, & 10). I personally did not like the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" feel, especially with the action sequences, but the movie is not a bad one, and is worth watching."
705,"At first I didn't knew why the viewer ratings were so low, so I was curious to see this movie for myself. Then I discovered that most user ratings were politically motivated, and nothing but anti-china bots, with nonsensical reasons to make this movie look bad. In that regard they failed their purpose, because its free publicity and it made me actually wanting to see the movie even more.After watching the movie myself, I can truly say it was beautifully made!The movie had good build up, majestically filmed. Yifei as Mulan was charistmatic and her charms added depth to the character Mulan. She sometimes speaks volumes without saying anything, and when she does say something its meaningful, those are rare qualities of an actor.At times it gave me goosebumps to finally see a live action version of Mulan, I have to admit I had to wipe some occasional tears away throughout the movie.Yifei companions were funny and their commaderie was heartfelt.Fun fact: Honghui was historically the love interest of Mulan, not Shang Li from the animated movie ;-)Eventhough without the musical songs that made the animated version popular, but there were enough references to the animation throughout the movie that did honor to the animated version.
All the actors were great and solid, especially the father played by Tzi Ma was convincing as a caring and inspirational father to Mulan in such a short timespan of character development.Sad fact: Historically Mulan fought a war campaign of 12 years. She never did get to see her father again, because when she got home her father already died of old age. Traumatized by warefare, Mulan never became her old self, and she committed suicide, hoping she could reunite with her father in the afterlife being that carefree loving daughter again....The encounter with the Witch (Xinniang) played by Gong Li was superbly done. I think the witch might even have been a metaphor for Mulans inner fears. It was so poetically well executed.I am glad Jetli got to do some of his last few action sequences, as Jetli is suffering from returning illnesses, the reason why he doesn't do much action nowadays.Bori Khans character is the equivalent of Shan Yu in the animated version, and is in the live action more fleshed out as to what his motivations were for attacking the kingdom, that was a nice touch.I recommend this movie highly for the fans of the original anime and for people who are new to the story of Mulan.For me it was A well worthy tribute to both the legendary chinese folklore story Mulan aswell as the orginal disney animated version!"
706,This movie was everything I was looking forward too. I thought it was beautifully done.
707,"The rating on here is so unfair. I have only written one review so far but I saw the rating of this film and thought it definitely deserves more credit. It's hard to please everyone with a live action movie. Did they change a lot from the 1997 film? Yes! Is that a bad thing? No! The changes that the live action made were great because they made the story feel more real. Having a humorous talking dragon and the huns ""pop out of the snow like daisies"" would have probably seemed very cheesy in the live action. In my opinion the live action of Aladdin suffered from being very accurate to the cartoon, lots of parts came off as very cheesy, especially the cringey dance scene. People tend to complain if the live actions don't do anything different or they'll complain if it's the exact same. The changes didn't hurt the movie. The cinematography was still great, acting was superb, the fight scenes were great and Mulan is still really bad a**. Please still give this movie a chance and form your own opinion about it. I would've given this movie 8 stars but I gave it 10 stars because of the unfair ratings."
708,"Enjoyable traditional Chinese action film - Great cinematography and costume sets
Well worth a watch"
709,"Frankly, I thought this was pretty good and many of you are missing the point of this movie. While I have read some valid critiques, some are just nonsensical.I understand that there was no Mushu or there were no songs. Trust me, I do wish they were incorporated, but this movie was mainly to show the Chinese culture, while also still enacting the central plot from the animated adaption of the film. It was to show our heavy family values, some of our customs, etc. I enjoyed this because it was different than the animated film, and different does not mean bad. I will admit this movie was geared more towards more international markets, especially in China and other Asian countries, but the point of this movie was to highlight beauty of Chinese culture and values, which I hope you guys can appreciate.Is this movie perfect? Not at all. But I would say I am proud to have this movie as a representation of Chinese people. I know that they swayed away from the animated adaption, but you should not let that deter you from not enjoying it. I think it may be hard to watch it as a non-Chinese person, but try to enjoy it (despite its hefty price)."
710,"Too much violence in the movie .
Not recommended for family to watch .
Also disappointed to the plot , can't compare to the old version Mulan"
711,"Guys... it's a Disney movie, what did you expect. It still has to fit within the Disney formula, but with that, it does a fantastic job of being culturally and aesthetically authentic to China in that era. Of course its going to feel stale in the story because it fits in the Disney mold. But the action is fantastic, the visuals are stunning and it is extremely well made."
712,"As you see, so many have more expectation than others. i dont mind if its not fit for everyone. its not a 10/10 movie but i give 10, becouse its defenietly not 1. as you see many give that. and its not fair. so i will make a ballance of not fair people. :)"
713,"I thought it was going to be like the original cartoon but it wasn't. I'm glad it's not, this movie was an original piece. It has alot of great martial art actors. Great action throughout the whole movie. I feel like they could even make a follow up movie or even a series out from this cast. We shall see what the future holds."
714,"The acting and production were all well done. The story line was more historically accurate than the animation, which I would assume would be a good thing. We really enjoyed this live action story of Mulan. If no animation had ever been done, this should stand by itself anyway. I recommend it. Very entertaining."
715,"I don't understand the hate for this movie or the 5.0 rating on here. I think maybe it is because of the fact there is no songs or Mushu, or the whole situation that started the boycott Mulan trend.
As someone who has been a long time fan of the original, this in my opinion was a lot better than the original. I say this because I loved the new characters, especially Xianniang the new villian played by the legendary Gong Li. She was a very great villain.
I also really loved Liu Yifei in this movie, a few of her moments especially one of her moments at the end really got my teary eyed. She was amazing as Mulan and Niki Caro was right that she was without a doubt the best Mulan. I give full credit to Caro for choosing her and I don't give a crap on what anyone has to say about her.
While there are a lot of changes, there is also scenes from the original changed up a bit. Like the matchmaker scene instead of it being with a cricket, it was with a spider instead. Some of the fight scenes were similar but most were brand new for this remake.
Good job Mulan! You brought honor to my family. I give this movie a 9 out of 10. Will definitely buy on DVD when it comes out in December."
716,"This movie was fantastic! It did Mulan proud. TBH I have never really loved the music in the original (except be a man), I'm there for the story. I absolutely love the take they did on it! Ignore the haters and just sit back and enjoy yourself."
717,"It's not really a 10, but too many reviewers (some of whom haven't even watched it) seem predetermined to give it a 0 that I'm overcompensating. What's good: the casting, blending new and appealing young actors with well-invested veterans. The rich look and production. What's ok: the story; there are no surprises, but it remains a good yarn with a moral center; and the action: I don't think it will make viewers rewind to see it again, but you're alert. What's bad: not a lot of laughs, and even some lugubrious scenes that need not have been so serious, especially those overdoing the ""shame to your family"" thread."
718,"This is nothing like the cartoon version, which is better. The only thing that made the cartoon version better was the song ""Reflection"" which showed her inner struggle more clearly. But this movie version is correct and realistic in many ways for that era (except some characters, of course). A good war movie and strong display of life's values. I recommend this movie and surely will ask all my nieces and nephews to watch this."
719,"I know there are people who think remaking already great animated films is a waste and I tend to agree, but honestly I haven't had any issues with watching the live action versions of these movies.Mulan has always been one of my favorite Disney movies (and characters), she is a female that no one took seriously and in order to save her disabled father from death, she pretends to be a male and saves freaking China. This is the ultimate female empowerment movie. Normally I don't care about that sort of thing, I'm not a feminist, but I love how Mulan proved herself as more than just a woman, and she showed that even though she may not physically overtake a man, she was smart and used her brain in order to defeat the enemy. That's what I took away from the movie.In this version I would say that the part of Mushu was greatly missed (Eddie Murphys voice really enhanced the animated version and no remake can ever top that).
Other than that I would say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie."
720,"Whether you're talking about the amazing job that Disney did in remaking The Jungle Book in live-action or how they made a very disappointing attempt at bringing Dumbo back to life, there's no denying that they aren't slowing down anytime soon. Mulan was their latest to be released earlier this year, but due to many complications, it has now premiered on Disney+. While I can't say it surpasses the animated original in any way, it's absolutely one of the better remakes they've done. I could see this reaching a wide audience over time, but with this particular release strategy, I can't see 2020s Mulan making a big enough splash. Here are my thoughts on Mulan as a whole.Much like the original film, this rendition of Mulan follows the titular hero as she disguises herself as a man in order to join the war in place of her father. Going against traditional family and gender beliefs, she rises to the occasion and bests everyone around her. She's had training her whole life, so it comes as no surprise at all when she's able to pull off incredible feats, which I feel is the film's greatest downfall, even though it's entertaining. The emotional core is very much present, but things do feel like they're glossed over at times. With that said though, for every minor issue, there was always a positive to balance it all out.As I said, the greatest downfall is that there's not a single surprising thing to the character of Mulan this time around. On top of that, the absence of music is very much felt here, because they chose to include narration, explaining certain character's choices instead. This felt very pointless to me as it felt like it was dumbing everything down for the audience. I truly feel that these choices did hurt the film as a whole. Still, this is a very well-made movie all around.From the score to the cinematography, this film feels epic in every sense of the word. Sadly, with it being sent to streaming, the big screen experience just won't be possible for this movie anymore. There are some massive sweeping shots that would've benefited from a giant screen, but it is what it is. For this reason, I found myself attached to the more subtle character moments, which ended up giving the movie a layer I may not have latched onto on the big screen. Maybe that's just me, but I felt the movie's weaknesses were given an accent with this watch-at-home tactic.In the end, the 2020 live-action remake of Mulan probably isn't going to have die-hard fans preferring it over the one the loved in the past, but newcomers may get a nice story to follow along with. Yifei Liu does a great job in the title role and felt like she was paying homage to the animated film while also making it her own. The original story is still present, but different, which was nice, and the epic scope is absolutely felt, making this a great movie to look at. I will say some of the creative choices/changes didn't quite work for me, but it's still a very enjoyable movie overall. I'd say give it a watch, especially for families."
721,"SERIOUSLY a 5???? I'm a huge fan of movies I've watched probably more than anyone in the planet, I watch a minimum of 3 a day and have done that for over 10 years!! Now back to this masterpiece, let's see, phenomenal choreography, phenomenal fight scenes. Tension, touching emotions, phenomenal cinematography, just watch it as a stand alone movie its amazing!! Its been awhile since I cheered during a movie and it brought a tear to my eye 3 tomes!! And what a phenomenal ending!! I pray to the Disney gods to please give us a part 2!!! Great job Disney, great job cast and crew!!!"
722,"Was well written, after and the beauty of colors and scenery was amazing.
Did it follow the cartoon 100% ? No. Thankfully.
People here will say she worked hard and became a great warrior but here it was by magic. That's a lie. As a child she was taught by her father and she had a very strong inner Chi- where she honed her talent from a young age. So no her strength never came from magic. But yet when the nay sayers talk about magic and not hard work they neglect to talk about the cartoon's magical creatures helping her on her journey. So again they are wrong.
The cartoon and movie are not aligned with any mythological character's story line so why 'try' to use that against the movie but not that cartoon.
The movie goes more in-depth about honor, chi, male-female roles, FEMALE empowerment love of family, love of country, good vs bad etc etc.
it's a definite watch. Sit back with or without the kids and enjoy. Don't be a Debbie downer- sorry to all Debbies"
723,"This was the best live action Disney movie so far. The original is amazing and the live action is also amazing in its own way. I understand the movie strayed from the original animation and did not have things like Mushu or the songs. I personally don't think it would of fit well into the kind of movie they remade Mulan as.I also understand it was expensive to buy, but Disney is kind of losing money on this and the movie still needs to make some sort of money that it would of in theaters. For example, if one person buys the movie they can watch it with unlimited people; rather than, each person having to buy a ticket. I'm glad Disney decided to give us a way to be able to see it during these tough times in the pandemic even though the money they will make in return might not be as much."
724,"It was always going to be a big ask making a live-action copy of an animated classic. Imagine doing a live-action Shrek or Toy Story? Doesn't matter who or what you put in it, it wouldn't hold up. So I was hopeful but sceptical. It's a pretty movie to look at, the filmmakers improved on that score. Costumes, sets and scenery etc, but the character development was woeful. Had you not seen the 1998 version you would struggle to understand much of the underlying premise of the story or the character(s). Struggles. The filmmakers instead introduced something akin to super-powers to highlight Mulan's determination rather than the self-belief and belonging as per the original. The screenplay was weak but the actors did a very good job with what they had. Putting it all together, it was an OK movie. Not bad, but not great and nowhere near as good as the original."
725,"Lots of moving lips and dialogue just for the sake of moving the story forward. Sadly the story doesn't move the characters forward with it. This movie looks beautiful, I'm not going to bash the cast....but the writing sucked. It's flat. It's boring. And it is not entertaining at all. There's no montage to explain why Mulan is good; she just ""digs deep"" when the moment calls for it and gets ""tough"" and gets stronger than a man. I'm sorry that's hard to follow in the ""real world"". And if I have to follow it in the fantasy world then you better write a darn good story."
726,. It's a movie that at no point makes you really care about any of them. Clearly it was made for the big screen so watching it on a home television really made it lackluster and not worth being charged twice.
727,"A wonderful Disney-movie with alot of heart. it's no remake, cause the animated version has nothing to do with the legend behind this.This movie IS the legend behind Mulan,and its filmed and acted with alot of heartblood.I really loved it, watched it 2 times!!!Thank you, Disney."
728,"What ever people say, i really love Disney make Mulan to live action >.<"
729,"The acting was good, cinematography was top notch. Fight scenes were great. What's not to like?"
730,"Mulan, Dreams can take you wherever you want to go, so cherish them."
731,"It's not the animated remake you grew up watching but they never did say it would be. The changes made were reasonable and culturally sound. I love the women empowerment message. The costumes and colors were great. I missed the songs, but I'm glad they played some of the music in the background. My only complaint was the ending could've been a little better, but overall 8.5-9/10 will watch again!!!"
732,If you're going into this movie expecting mushu and lucky the cricket your setting yourself up for a disappointment. It's not a remake. It's a well made standalone movie with some bows to the animation. For example the tea ceremony and there is a boy called lucky. I really enjoyed it and I'm a die hard Mulan fan from the original. Give it a go. It's a good movie and the actor playing Mulan is excellent
733,"Such an empowering movie for young girls. The animated version is my second favorite Disney money (after beauty and the beast) so I had high hopes for this, and it definitely passed them! LOVED IT!!"
734,"Why even bother calling it Mulan.
Dont understand why you need to change everything just for the sake of changing...
There is nothing in this movie what the original made mulan what mulan is."
735,"Dishonor to you, dishonor to your family, dishonor to your cowI honestly feel like if Disney wants to make a movie and in the process of making it bend backwards to appease our great and beloved communist party of China and its leader Winnie the pooh stunt double they should at least make a good fun movie. Not this horribly boring crap they pulled. The original cartoon was more grounded than this crap. Let that sink in for a moment, the cartoon with a talking dragon and dancing ghosts was more realistic than this movie. The fact that they decided to do a fantasy kungfu movie but disney style (read half-assed) makes this movie fall on its face from the very first opening scene and then crawl to the finish line 2 hours later (which is 2 hours too many). The story makes zero sense, none, the characters change opinions and allegiances on a whim. The main character behaves like a dick for some reason from the very beginning. There is no reason or logic behind anything in the movie. This movie has exactly 2 saving graces hence 2 stars score. The orchestral references to the original songs (albeit all are brief) and the Ming Na Wen cameo at the end. I can not stress how bad this movie is."
736,"It was a great one, I mean the greatest movie I have ever seen. Those who are dumb are giving this movie low rates. These film shows that the women can do anything and everything. There is nothing to compare a woman with a man and this film shows it clearly."
737,"Disney has converted a series of cartoons and Mulan is definitely not a bad one. Comparing to the Lion King, Mulan is much better. The action scenes are very exciting and the story is also very well told. I have to say it's not perfect, either. I'd say it's definitely worth the price in cinema, but at home, it depends...The explanation of chi isn't that clear, or it's even very confusing. To be honest, I'd rather not to mention chi if I were the director.I was hesitating previously because of the so many 1 star review. Once I started the movie, I actually enjoyed it a lot.==== End of review, below are side notes =====Then, I realized that lots of 1-star review was purely for political reasons. I personally don't feel comfortable mixing arts and politics. It's just wrong to spread misleading message with preset hatrad mind. Art is art."
738,"I've seen quite a few of the recent Disney remakes, and my one rule of thumb is: don't judge the film based on the animated movie. That being said, this live action adaptation takes more inspiration from the legend of Hua Mulan than the 1998 animated version does, which I find to be fresh. It's a very colorful movie, and the richness of color combined with beautiful backgrounds and landscapes, as well as set pieces makes it a feast for the eyes. The movie is also well choreographed and the fighting is very believable, and the score and music are also very well done.The characters of Hua Mulan and her father all feel really fleshed out. There is very little character development other than that, sadly. The rest seem almost like cardboard-ish cutouts. Also, there is very little humor and the absence of the character of the wisecracking sidekick Mushu is very noticeably felt. (Although, the lucky ""Crikee"" does make an appearance in one scene).Also, it's clever that the filmmakers snuck Ming-Na Wen (the voice of Mulan from the original animated movie) into a cameo towards the end of the film.It's not a bad movie whatsoever. It's got a solid story, believable characters and action sequences, and gorgeous scenery and cinematography. However, that being said, it does leave something to be desired. It's missing something about overall, that you'll have to decide for yourself what it is."
739,"Let me start by saying it wasn't terrible as a movie. However as a remake it doesn't compare to the original at all. There were a few moments that I felt were cheesy. I hate when movies push narratives or include things in movies to be ""woke"" and make them feel forced instead of natural. It isn't as magical or rewatchable as the original. It was just decent for me. Maybe if you have no knowledge of the first one you will enjoy it more than I did."
740,"I was expecting Mulan to be strong since any movie with a female lead nowadays is OP, but she's on the verge of being a superhero that it's dumb. Give her some obstacles, a challenge, and some better acting skills. The movie was pretty boring actually and the effects were pretty bad, definitely not worth 30 dollars, glad I didn't pay to see it. The actress definitely has some mad skills, they should've used that to make the fighting scenes more realistic instead of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon in one scene and semi-realistic in another. Watch it and forget about it."
741,"I almost never leave reviews, but man, this was bad.Since Mulan is probably my favourite Disney movie and my favourite princess, I was super excited for this movie, and needless to say, had high expectations.This movie tried so hard to NOT be like the cartoon that The story got stripped of all its soul, fun, and logic. Somehow everything managed to become overly dramatic, while acting was non-existing. There was no Development to the characters. There's no music, which is funny considering that most Disney movies are musicals. They replaced the dragon with a Phoenix (why?!).This movie left me so icky and unsatisfied that I just went and watched the original Mulan immediately after.The only positive thing about this movie is the cinematography, and the fight scenes. For the rest, this movie is not worth your money. Do yourself a favour and skip it."
742,"Honestly the movie was good. Beautiful cast and adjustments that is okay to make. Many peoples complained about certain characters was removed but keep in mind this is a live action not an anime. And from the asian culture, a Phoenix represents Queen or a femininity which explains why the Dragon was replaced with a Phoenix. I'm not saying it's okay to replace the original but this is 2020 some moderation has to be made. Focus on the plots, the movies show us the similar themes to the original and you have to give props to the actresses who did an amazing job."
743,"Mulan is a visually beautiful movie. Directed by Niki Caro, whose enchanting 2002 film ""Whale Rider"" felt like a family-friendly, live-action Disney fantasy, ""Mulan"" is no mere remake. It's simultaneously an homage to and an overhaul of the 1998 animated feature, a robust reimagining of that film's original source, Yuefu folk song ""The Ballad of Mulan,"" and the somewhat dated cartoon it spawned. Unlike ""The Lion King"" or ""Beauty and the Beast,"" which slavishly adhered to their underlying IP, ""Mulan"" feels as if it were made by someone who didn't necessarily love Disney's earlier treatment. That may disappoint fans who grew up on that version but should pose no obstacle to a new generation sure to be inspired by this epic-scale tribute to female empowerment."
744,"I'll give this a positive review. The film reminded me of Crouching Tiger, Hero, House of Flying daggers, which I found surprising for a Disney Film. The final battle with the villain (hello Jason Lee from Jungle Book 1994) was something right out of mid-2000s Chinese warrior movie. I enjoyed the additions of magic, chi, and a witch. I enjoyed that Mulan still saved her battalion with an avalanche. I liked the cute barracks scenes where Mulan has to still hide her breasts from all these men.The only thing that urked me, since this is PG-13, was lack of blood. I'm so utterly used to bloody pitched battle scenes, that a lack of blood in battle is noticeable. But this is a Disney movie, so c'est la vie."
745,Weak all around and not worth the currently exhorbitant price of admission. Wouldn't even bother watching this train wreck at the dollar theater to be honest.
746,"In the original mulan every girl could have been mulan. Work hard go trough adversity and show every men what your are capable of. Now no girl can be mulan, because noone has these chi powers... It just sucks... The most important scenes that show her path are not included... She doesn't have to work for her skills, they are just given... Pretty stupid... Actually I would give it 5 stars but the way they handled Hongkong... Pure disappointment... That's not the mulan we need, the one who fights against tyrants and doesn't support them"
747,"Mulan is a hands down, absolute favorite Disney movie of ours. My husband and I were so excited to see this. He fell asleep 20 minutes in and I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The first 56 minutes were horrendously boring. No way I make my kids sit through this."
748,Liu obviously missed the spirit of Mulan. A complete disappointment.
749,"No mushu, no songs (be a man is an iconic Milan song), also, Mulan goes to the army already talented, so there's no growth scene. Also there's no comedic relief what so ever. The worst Disney remake to date."
750,"-There's not mushu.
-The grandmother does not appear.
Changed the whole story.The essence of the film is not there."
751,"Boring af. Totally overpriced.
Mulan becomes a football player who kicks all kinds of weapon.
My son fell asleep in the midway.
Anime is much better than this one."
752,The worst. Cheesy. Slow. Boring. Missing all the good pets from the cartoon. A complete disappointment and waste of my life I'll never get back.
753,"Mulan has always been my favourite movie and I was so excited for them to create a "" human "" version!! But they literally ruined it, there's no emotions or thrill or even good background music. They are missing out on every parts that makes Mulan so special. It is such a disgrace to the animation movie. When you have more thrill and chills watching a cartoon than a real life movie, its because you truly failed it. Cant believe I paid 35$ for that"
754,"Honestly, the biggest pile of wank I have ever seen. I'd rather soil in my hands and clap than have to watch this again."
755,"Woman power is great but when that overpowers what Mulan is and shadows the real themes, adversity that Mulan went, it simply ruins the movie. Gets annoying after a while and no good character development. I seriously want a refund"
756,"It is not the same as animated one, the actress is bad in performance, none of sense of ""BIG CHINA "" . And the film is disgraced CHINA."
757,These are the movies young girl's needs to see. The entire movie was absolutely incredible. Captivating and powerful. I loved it far more than the original I grew up with. I sure hope there is a sequel.
758,"I know a lot of people love the original animated version but it's hard for me to imagine copying the animated musical version into the live-action because seriously, Asians don't act that way in ancient time. I like the fact that Disney consider that. I love the cast so much their chemistry is great! I love Yifei Liu and Gong Li (and when they're together haha) a lot! It's almost like they're asking one another and asking themselves. Also the interaction between Mulan and Honghui is subtly beautiful (don't know if it's a cultural thing I think the subtleness is actually very sexy haha, but if there's a sequel then please more love story of these two haha). And the love between Mualn and her family is just so moving for me to watch. Overall I enjoyed watching this movie a lot!"
759,"The movie is not a tipical disney kid movie, this version of Mulan was great, a true movie for a nice story, completely unexpected."
760,"Take it from Hunter Biden's HONEYPOT! Wait 'till you hear what comes out about the lead actress. ""The laptop from hell!"""
761,Just got done watching this film for the second time and for the second time watching it I liked it even more.Very underrated movie which I like very much.If you never seen it before worth the watch.
762,"5 out of 5 stars.Mulan is a fantasy adventure film that has a serious approach to the disney animated movie. While staying similiar to the story that made the original lovable. The plot following Mulan (Yifei Liu) who is destined by her mother that she needs to meet a man and wed. When a war is coming which the emperor enlists one son from every family. Mulan and her sister being the only siblings. Her father prepares to join but with his aging slowing him down. Mulan takes the family sword and armor. And joins the army to face against a witch army who is plotting to take over the Emperor.Similiar plot. The film is a little serious. Compare to the original which was musical and had talking animals. The film does lack the musical set pieces and talking animals. But it does pay some homage to those characters that may or may not disappoint hard core fans.The cinematography is beautifully done. Capturing the set pieces and settings. The music score is great. The action sequences are exciting and well done. A couple of exciting battle sequences that is well choreographed with the fighting and camera work. The cast ensemble is great. Yifei Liu did a great job as playing Mulan.Overall, it is a great film with slight differences but similar story. Exciting action and visuals."
763,"I rarely write reviews and I try to write good ones, but this was the worst Disney production I have seen.
If this is all the writers can come up with, then Disney is in big trouble. No newer Disney oroduction could measure up, but this is a new low. Empty dialogues without deeper meaning. Just phrases stringed together. Bad CGI effects, miss-matched colours, that have nothing with the time in which the story plays. All the writing and story and acting are a total lack of emotions.
An old chinese tale ruined.
Shame."
764,"Our family has LOVED this show, every time we watch! The principles are ones that we teach our children.. HONOR, BRAVE, TRUE!THANK YOU for making a clean, family movie that we can all watch for years to come!"
765,"Awesome movie! I don't understand why people are giving such negative reviews, this is an amazing and accurate movie, the graphics are beautiful and it is a very inspirational, empowering story. I loved every minute of it and I would watch it again and again as much as possible."
766,"The animation has been one of my favorites in my childhood and did weight in with my character building. Mulan in the animation is an ideal woman for me, courageous, funny and beautiful. Yifei Liu played the role well but the story was a mess, with its shallow and bricolage storyline, and other stereotyped characters and settings about Chinese landscape and culture. It did surprise me in 2020 to still see such a understanding and representation of other cultures with so much budget by one of the world's most successful film production companies. U brought dishonor to yourself, to use one of the lines in the movie."
767,"Never watched Mulan animation, and this right here is just lame... Poor acting, the photography doesn't look Disney quality, bad character development, and doesn't seems nothing monumental... The fights are bad choreographed. Looks like K. Kennedy touched another Disney property... And made sht out of it."
768,"Mulan really has the potential to be a successful live action remake but they've blown it. I pirated this movie and I still want my $30 back. To summarize:
1. They turned Mulan from a relatable character with actual flaws and character development into a Mary Sue. The moral of the story changes from ""Through hard work and strong will, everyone can utilize their own strength to show that they are equally capable"" to ""Women can only be equal to men if they have some superpower"". They basically made a Chinese Elsa out of Mulan.
2. Unnecessary changes. They took out all the fun aspects of the movie: the songs, the side characters, and the pivotal moments--and changes it into something...less. All of the side characters are underutilized especially the witch who's there because of.....girl power? All of Mulan's soldier friends lack depth and I honestly only realized they're supposed to be Ling, Yao, and Chien Po after they spoke out the lyrics to A Girl Worth Fighting For (a cringe-worthy moment...either do it or don't).
3. Ugly acting and horrible editing. Liu Yifei has only what...3 expressions during the whole movie? She shed 1 (one) tear for her father, slightly annoyed face when knocked down by a fellow soldier, and the rest is a flat, boring face. It's like she's so afraid of looking ugly. And don't get me started on the editing. The jump cuts in many scenes are so jarring and disorienting that the audience really can't place themselves in the movie.
4. Culturally inaccurate. They say they take out Mushu to make this live action more ""realistic"" but they really didn't do much. What they do is romanticize as much orientalism as possible. Westernized view of Chinese values/legends and even then most of the details are messed up. What is that ugly makeup? That Southern China house for a Northern China legend? Wrong interpretation of Qi (not Chi)? Western phoenix? A witch??? Honestly I could go on.Seriously this movie is a trainwreck right from the very beginning until the end. They are trying SO hard yet they flop. I guess that's what you get when you don't involve any actual Chinese person in the filmmaking process, but still try to make this film to please the Chinese government...but not providing Chinese subtitles in your platform. Lmao Disney is a joke I'm sure Walt is stirring in his grave.Don't waste your $30 guys. Seriously."
769,"Stiff acting, poor combat, not what you thought you were gonna watched. Suffered the whole film."
770,"There was absolutely no need for this piece of work, when the original movie was such a masterpiece. This movie is about a bunch of soulless and robotic characters which make questionable decisions throughout. Disney, please stop doing this, and think of better ways for making money."
771,"Having seen most of the modern live-action remakes to Disney classics and having read some of the reviews for this one, I went into this movie with my expectations set on minimum. I really wanted to be surprised and enjoy it, to say the least. I don't hate all the previous remakes, I thought Beauty and The Beast was pretty good, and Aladdin and The Lion King just fine (although none of them come even close to the originals). Next in line comes Mulan, the newest Disney live-action re-imagining of an animated classic. Right from the first scene, this movie seems...sloppy, clumsy, unfinished. The visuals and cinematography were pretty good most of the time and that's pretty much everything good about it. Everything else from the script to the characters, to the acting is terrible. I don't know much about the original Chinese tale of Mulan, but since this is a remake of the animated movie, the story is butchered. I get the themes they were trying to touch upon, like a girl living in a ""man's world"", the value of family, finding your place and accepting yourself for who you really are. None of these is really achieved. Right from the start we learn that Mulan has powers and even from young age she can fight better than experienced fighters, this alone ruins the whole movie for me. You don't need to know how to fight in order to be a fighter, it's something the writers should know. The whole second act of the original movie is Mulan training in the camp disguised as a man and learning how to fight to honor her family and her country, she didn't come there already knowing kung-fu, sword fighting and having super powers. She needs to make sacrifices in order to get better and in this journey she makes friends and enemies. But now, knowing that she is already stronger than the whole Chinese army, how are we supposed to feel anything for her during this whole movie? There are literally zero stakes, she can beat anything and anyone, well except her evil counterpart witch Xian, probably the worst written character in this whole movie. At the beginning she is presented as the main villain (not the evil Khan), but in the final battle they try to make her a tragic character, a woman who made the mistake of being born on the wrong side. The fights are terrible, especially that big battle scene with zero logic and sense, the characters are mostly one-dimensional, corny, terribly acted and there for the sake of it. I can talk about this for the rest of the day but i'd rather not. All i can say is this movie is a corny mess with no real stakes, terrible screenplay, terrible casting (except Donnie Yen) and some really awful decisions story wise. Being a sloppy, heartless ride, I can honestly say that in my opinion this is the worst live-action Disney remake up to this point."
772,"They basically took out all the good part of the original Mulan, and replaced them with trash, worst remake movie ever."
773,"The old film was soooo good when I was a kid. Humor, great animation and a brilliant story.This film. Is visually great but incredibly soulless. Poor story line. Nothing like the original. Trying the be ""more realistic"" by leaving out Mushu etc, it's Disney how ridiculous. Add some humor, some originality. Such a great cast. Yet I was left massively dissapointedSame as the lion King and jungle book.Poor show Disney, POOR SHOW."
774,"Contadictions and a complete lack of understanding why certain scenes were important in the first place, terrible delivery and a message so transparent, the film doesn't realise its an uncomfortable parody of itself. Unless you have something to bring to the table disney, stop rehashing successful stories."
775,"They put a lot of effort into this movie with the scenery and the special effects. The story isn't so great though, lots of plot holes and bad acting.
It mimics Crouching Tiger at times but it just doesn't seem to fit here.
This is written for kids under 16 as anyone older will see all of the mistakes and it is just not that enjoyable."
776,"From the sets, makeup, costumes and worst still even the plotting, script and dialogue are all super duper cliched-silly-fake. Just a load of gaudy items in a cheap sale bin that find no takers. 😞And she's so obviously a pretty young lady throughout the movie and everyone else gotta act retarded pretending she's a manly man?? What utter crock is that??The only redeeming thing is that it temporarily gave jobs to hundreds of people 😅"
777,"I love the legend of Mulan, it's such a cool character. This movie however does not do it justice apart from stunningly beautiful costumes and sets. hence the three stars. Not the fault of the actors i might add, they had so little to work with.
It differs quite a bit from the cartoon, The comedic parts are so watered down that they become totally forgetable.Kids:
Watch the cartoon instead. you won't forget that
grownups:
Everything Disney tries here was done in vastly superior fashion by Ang Lee in his masterpiece that is Crouching Tiger Hidden dragon."
778,"I hardly ever comment but after all the weird and unfair hate this movie is getting - here I am. Let me start by emphasizing that I'm absolutely fan of the animated Mulan fan and have been from childhood. My very first pair of shoes were Mulan light-up shoes! However, despite many of the movie critics ('cause what do they know right?) liked the movie, some of the audience's critiques (some baseless) started to get to me. After watching the film, I am so glad I didn't listen!I wasn't alone either. I watched the admittedly pricey film with my parents who often get bored with films very easily and absolutely dread childish movies. I was a bit nervous at the beginning when the movie started a little slow but I was relieved to find it was short lived 'cause the movie picks up quickly afterwards. Soon we were laughing, moved, and completely stunned by the beautiful movie all while being on the edge of our seats. I was even crying not even 20 minutes in!I would like to spend the rest of this review answering back to some of the critiques that I've been hearing that I had mentioned above because some are just ... well let's discuss!First and foremost, I felt the film did a much better justice to paint how beautiful, breathtaking, and truly amazing Chinese culture and history is. Are there places where they got it wrong, I'm sure. But is it a step in the right direction? Yes.Second of all, this Mulan rendition gave depth, especially in places in the story that Disney had originally skipped over. One example is how it covered a glaring plot hole in the animation by explaining what exactly was it in Mulan that made her truly different from everyone else to point of her and her family fearing dishonor (giving context to Reflection and Mulan's overall character). It also solidified the supporting cast as actual soldiers instead of being a comedic bunch who happen to be able to throw a punch despite months of military training. Even minor characters such as the the emperor was given more room and not portrayed as a damsel in distress along with the major villain. Each was shown to be a skilled leader with their own goals and history, making me love them way more in this movie than the animated one.Sure there is no Mushu or singing and dancing cast. But now, I'm absolutely glad they weren't in this movie which ultimately uplifted the female empowerment message of the movie. With no Mushu to push her or ""guide"" Mulan, all the burden squarely on her shoulders giving her more agency. Seeing her accept who she is and choosing to follow her heart despite the very real consequences of death or expulsion/dishonor was made all the more satisfying and moving to witness. She didn't need a talking dragon to parent her, especially when it was simply a token character created to make a cultural movie more digestible to an audience who would not have otherwise been attracted to a telling of a cultural folktale to begin with.Side note: I think many misunderstood the purpose of her ""skills"" as something alike to being a chosen one which simply isn't the case because the movie clearly stated that men have skills too. It is only a problem when women possesses the same skills as they are seen then as superhuman or witches. I would like to point out that even in the animation, Mulan was depicted to be the only one who had truly shown to have learned martial arts enough to put into combat use. Comb through the scenes and you will see the difference, that few in the army are shown to progress as far as she does. Rather than viewing this as a chosen one film, I would say that the cartoon and live action Mulan both are quick studies, the live action Mulan picking skills up at an earlier age than the cartoon.No songs were replaced by conversation that achieved the same goal. I almost didn't miss the songs. Don't get me wrong, I still will belt them out whenever the opportunity arises, but now I simply do not look at them the same way. Having that on top of a singing and dancing cast would have made this movie unbearable and cheapen it.Finally this whole ""bad acting"" critique.... I'm sure this is coming from people who aren't familiar with watching foreign movies, expecting each character to fluently speak and express English with an animated face. This being an all Asian cast, with English not being the first language of many in the movie, its unrealistic in my opinion to expect an American accent. So of course the dialogue is going to be appear to be ""choppy"".Now where did this movie fail? There definitely could have been more comedy. At times, especially later, the movie felt rigid and lacked the same charming fluidity that came with the animation. Maybe it was unavoidable because it was dealing with naturally tougher content? Also the action CGI was a little off (for a lack of a better way to describe it) and flamboyant. On the other hand, I see this often with Asian historical action movies. We all know Disney clearly has the resources and money to do better so maybe this was intentional to appeal to the Asian audience? Who knows? But it didn't take away from the movie one bit. There are a plethora of thrilling scenes to make up for it."
779,"If you want the Disney Cartoon, you probably have it on DVD. If you want action great scenery. Enjoy. It's a Movie. It's not History."
780,"Mulan is a 2020 Action Adventure remake based on the tale of The Ballad of Mulan and the 1998 animated classic and stars Yifel Liu,Jason Scott Lee and Jet Li. The story is about a young woman named Fa Mulan who takes her father's place in the war disguised as a man. But will her cover be blown.If you are looking for comic relief,catchy songs,girl getting the guy in the end and a memorable villain then you have come to the wrong place. If you don't mind that then you might like it.There are 2 villains in this film one can shape shift like Mystique from XMen,the other is like Shang Lu. Jet Li seemed weird here like he was been dubbed over,certain scenes were rushed,the actress as Mulan was stiff yet she was ok(yeah and people give out about Emma Watson).The CGi can be noticeable too.Keep an eye out for the original Mulan and the ending credits with Yifel singing Reflection.Is it worth 22.99 euros or 30 dollars no.69%
6.2/10I prefer Aladdin,Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast than Mulan."
781,Just a disappointment.... no depth to anything just watch the classic and ignore this.
782,"How rubbish this movie,waste my time and money,not recommend"
783,"...but even they couldn't save the movie. The movie was utterly disappointing. Here's why, if you watch Chinese films then you would know there has been quite a few Mulan films over the years.... What's another? If Disney was going to make just another Mulan film to add to Chinas collection of Mulan films then that's just what they did. This is suppose to be a Disney film, which means it's not suppose to be just another Mulan film, it's suppose to be magical, funny, heartwarming but serious at the same time with a beautiful ending that everyone understands. This did the total opposite, from emotionless to an open ending. Yes, it was an open ending. Mind you if it was made for adults its OK, but kids watch this and they are left with a big what the heck moment. I won't say how so there won't be spoilers, but it was a what the heck moment."
784,"... but not as good. Storyline is boring, fight scenes are so so, even though the movie has all the big names like Jet Li, Donnie Yen ... What a big disappointment."
785,"It's an mediocre movie, short and lacks some serious character build up. Some scenes look really amazing but others feel like they are produced by an indie company with really bad effects. I expected a lot of changes in the movie and there were a lot of changes. Mostly i miss the funny side of the movie and they could have put some comical scenes inside despite the fact that Mushu doesn't exist here. It's sad to see such a cartoon become into this thing. I rarely give reviews to things but this made me kinda angry and nostalgic at the same time so here is my piece. Overall its 4 from me. Just go into the movie without any expectations and you will probably say meh at best."
786,"I was very excited to watch this movie and to sing along with the songs , just to find out there isn't any, and to find out the movie is nothing compared to the cartoon version, I suggest you guys don't watch it and waste your money on a movie that isn't the way it's supposed to be , y'all messed up."
787,"I didn't watch the original but I decided to give it a go. It really didn't hold my attention. Nothing really moved me. Seemed generic and lacked anything of real substance. At a certain point my interest in seeing how it ended went away, I was just waiting for it to end. Felt like it dragged on for ages. I had high hopes for this movie and Disney in general. What I'm seeing is a loss of quality in the brand. At this point I'm worried Disney will be ruining everything in the near future. A forgettable movie, I should have just rewatched a favorite instead of wasting my time with this."
788,"Mulan has become the Jedi of china. She got her victory from using her power, not though training. What is the point of having training scene for? To let her know that she cant do much without her superpower?"
789,"Poorly executed narrative, over-cut without love, wooden performances, ham-fisted attempts to narratively link scenes, no genuine attempt to truly own this recreation in the live action form. What a shame! And, after inflation, still $44mil more expensive than the animated original. I know what I would rather."
790,"I hated it.no cricket, no mushu, no songs, they changed some names. No love story at the end. Atleast aladden and other remakes still mostly followed the story line. This remake was boring. And disappointing"
791,"Movie had a lot of potential but fell flat and had no soul. I was OK with the deviation from the animated version and wanted to appreciate the new take but the acting was so so, the dialog was just OK and scenes were choppy. The ""magic"" side of it also weakened the overall story. Sad to see but happy they tried."
792,"Where the original animation was based on Mulan being a hero through hard work, cunning, and determination, this remake had none of that. Mulan relief solely on her mystical chi powers. What kind of lesson is this movie supposed to teach - that you're either a have or have not?Don't bother watching this movie, you'll just be disappointed."
793,"Firstly I see alot of negative Nigel reviews
:-
like it's too much like a ""Chinese Fantasy Film"" give me a break!
""Why have they cut the songs out""
Story was a little fast paced that's the only negative I have.
But the Story was good, and not a total remake of the cartoon so that was great!
Cutting the singalong out great idea! No one expects a warrior to burst into a stage song the night before battle.
Kept the romantic angle down great again.
Acting was solid all the way through, fight scenes were not too over the top and excellently choreogaphed and executed.I loved it!"
794,"Not a bad movie on its own, but growing up with the animated Disney one, this live action remake let me down, cutting out all my favorite parts for the sake of realism"
795,"The original movie is much different in the remake, no music 🎶 no magical little Eddie Murphy dragon following her around whispering encouraging words no handsome guard in the army she falls in love with that she kissed. The action scenes were okay but even up until the ending I was hoping for something more. It wasn't as good as I would have expected. The original had was better and they strayed too far from it in this remake. It's worth watching once it available on Disney plus content but paying an extra $29.99 for a not so great movie would kind put me off. Warning don't do it I watch for free so I only lost out on time."
796,"I'm seeing a lot of reviews saying that this lost the feel of the 1998 animated version...good! Don't get me wrong, J grew up with that movie and I love it! But it is an Americanized version of a classic Chinese ballad. This movie falls a lot closer (not exactly) to the traditional version, and it's still appealing to American audiences. As long as you're not expecting a shot-for-shot remake, this is a great story! It maintains the Disney feel while still telling an old tale. My main issue with it is the transition from scene to scene was pretty abrupt. Overall though, I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
797,"Mulan tells the story of an ancient China, and does it pretty well. Some of the dialogue could have been done better, but the fighting and action was pretty good. If you tuned in for the wisecracking dragon or the cricket...sorry but this was meant to be a more mature adaptation. Three of us watched it for 30.00, which was less than a night at the movies. My wife has watched it a 2nd time. In my opinion the best live action Disney film. I guess the people who hated this must be the same folks that liked the Joaquin Phoenix ""Joker"", which, just for comparison, I thought was garbage. The true entertainment value for me is very simple. Will I watch it again? For me, Mulan is a yes."
798,This movie was the best Disney movie in years. Left me feeling light hearted and loving my family. A great film directed at the children who loved the animated Mulan that are now adults. People rating this anything less then a 7 are crazy.
799,"Liu Yifei is upstaged by Gong Li. My favourite review of the movie that I think summarises it well is that ""is a movie created by committee"", it tries not to offend anyone so much that it lessens the plot, prevents character development and makes everything a bit rigid. What Disney has tried to do is to copy the formula of the force from ""Rey's"" character in Star Wars, but it doesn't quite work. But for a movie that is meant to inspire a generation of young girls, all it says is you can be equal in a mans world but never at the top."
800,"I would give it a 10 if the director follows everything in the original animated film.
There is almost no character development, awkward ""funny"" jokes, the city building looks like they were built for mmo from 10 years ago. Weak edited story and music.... The design of costume and weapon just look so bad and fake."
801,"What annoyed me the most about this live action remake of Mulan (and there was a lot to choose from!) is the fact that in the original animated version Mulan was an ordinary girl, who was perceived at the time as extraordinary because she was 'a woman?!!!'. This live action remake has taken Mulan's training, ingenuity and bravery and made her 'special' through an abundance of magical Chi.
As a woman, who was a young girl when I watched the original, Mulan was the only Disney character that inspired me, this one depressed me. She was great, just as she was, and maybe the same goes for the original animated film.
Disappointing."
802,"First of all this movie is based on the real Mulan story. From beginning to end, it was entertaining. From cinematography to story, you will enjoy this very much. I know many people hate on it because it is not as their childhood movie Mulan, but grow the hell up. Also probably because of the main actress using her voice on the situation in hong kong. For this movie just push all politics out of the way and just enjoy this world in the movie and follow the story. You will not be disappointed."
803,"It is a awful movie. It is not true to history, nor was it well made. It is not entertaining at all.
Don't waste your time and money."
804,"Another disappointment of the year. Pros: beautiful cinematohraphy, gorgeous images, great soundtrack. Cons: pacing is terrible, lack of character development, random and unexplained character motives, ridiculous amount of cuts in action sequences. It didn't feel as epic as it deserves to be."
805,"This adaptation of Mulan is more faithful to the original Chinese legend of Hua Mulan which separates it from the animated Disney film. This version of Mulan does NOT have Mushu, but he is not missed due to the more serious tone of the film. Also missing are the classic songs. The extraordinary scoring of the film makes up for the loss of musical numbers by playing instrumentals of the classic songs throughout the movie. Beautiful imagery, epic action scenes, and impeccable camera work create a film that is pure ART. Saying this film is empowering would be an understatement. The story of Hua Mulan has been hugely inspiring to many women, but it even brought me (a male) close to tears. Her journey is truly inspiring and shows the beauty, power, and grace of a woman. This is NOT the movie you grew up with as a kid, but there are SO many new and improved elements that make it more suited to an adult viewer. Some of the story is slightly different from the animated film which brings new and exciting twists. PLEASE watch this film. As long as you are open to a newer version of Mulan, you will be blown away. This film COMPLETELY surpassed all of my expectations, so I implore you to give it a chance!"
806,"This movie was brilliantly produced. The choreography of the fight scenes, the story line and by staying true to the original Chinese legend, it's a beautiful masterpiece. Using a full Chinese cast with experience in kung-fu truly makes the film more special. Liu Yu Fei in particular is outstanding."
807,Nice movie to watch with friends and family. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie in 3d cinema.
808,Just watched it on D+. Extremely beautiful and unforgettable!!
809,"A fantastic movie. One of the best I've seen in a very long time. A good amount of action. And lump in your throat scenes. Liu Yifei looks fantastic when she fights, she's so graceful and beautiful, you can't take your eyes off her. It's a very emotional roller coaster ride. Mulan shows courage, bravery, and devotion to her fellow soldiers, her superiors, and brings honor to her family. I want to see this movie again. Loved it."
810,It was very enjoyable and by far the best Disney movie I have ever watched and would love to see a sequel but I don't think that will happen
811,"The live-action remake of Mulan is watchable, but pretty forgettable.Leaving out Eddie Murphie's dragon was a bad decision, as the movie takes itself way too seriously for its own good and badly needs comic relief. Mulan herself doesn't have much in the way of character growth - at some point half way through we're told by a narrator that she's found herself and basically that's it.The final act fell apart for me. The emperor worship felt awkward, and Mulan suddenly turned into a superhero impervious to harm, which broke my suspension of disbelief.Still, she did get a good ending and it sure did look pretty."
812,I heard many news about this movie but anyway I love the way Yifei Liu acts.. She was stunning in this movie.
813,Very nice movie! It's better than the animated movie. It is good for family to watch together.
814,"A pander to capture Chinese audience, a lead actress that never learned how to act, a script infested with political correctness, a waste of time."
815,"Update; After reading that Parts were filmed in China's Xinjiang province where over 1 million Uyghur Muslim residents are being detained in camps and that the lead cast are just puppets agreeing to these acts of violence against protesters I decided to make my review a -10Watching a young girl having fun chasing a chicken (felt sorry for the chicken...) The chase goes such way that they end up climbing to a roof, The chicken flies off it and she is falling off it and both land on their feet/paws. I thought that was well done, nice! Everyone in the movie did a 'I am so ashamed of you' look and walked away. The worried dad speech results in give up your chi/life force energy gets spoken off. Looks like woman are only good to find a husband, lay down with him and bear children. Thank you Disney for teaching me this.Then she goes to replace her dad in the army. Has trouble to sleep between the men, so she won't end up having to sleep with the men. Thank you Disney for teaching me this. Training in the army goes on and she reconnects with her chi.We see a battle and we see a strategy explained by a wise general as a coward move... and we all know... that's not it general. Why did you not stay in general school. Then the lets strap in these breast ends up saving a life. She sees snow on a hill. I see the plan and I am thinking no one is that stupid. But the enemy army is without brains. Then returning to the army another you can only make babies, rest of you is useless. Thank you Disney for teaching me this. I thought she did very well but I am sure Disney is right about this one.Then the army turns to he/she is not useless. And she can lead an army. And suddenly she leads the army. Soldiers who could not bring 2 buckets of water up to a hill are now invincible. A King (most kings were inbreed power abusers) now has incredible chi powers also. She saves him on a really ridiculous movie set where she is standing on a beam of wood where beneath them is build a furnace for smelting metal (who thought this idea up?)... and then we go to the end so were again a nice obeying daughter. Thank you Disney for teaching me this.And what is up with the phoenix. Is our main character having a breakdown just to keep up with the world?"
816,"This is not a scene-by-scene remake, as other Disney live-action are, and that's a good think. I believe that following the original story to the letter will always leave the live action at a disadvantage (among other reasons, due to the nostalgia factor).Another thing that it has going for it is the lack of musicals. Don't get me wrong, I love Disney musicals...on animated films. I think that musicals in live actions are lackluster and sometimes even cringy. Anyway, if you were expecting that you will be disappointed.What didn't worked for me? Some changes to the characters, or the addition of new ones, that don't really add anything to the story; some parts of the new plot that don't make much sense; and the totally unrealistic action that reminded me of the typical unbelievable asian kung-fu movies (it wasn't like that in the original, so why on earth would they do that?). Besides that, the way they portray Mulan it's too cold, it prevents the viewer from caring, and I think that's the whole point of this story.It was interesting, but I don't see any point in recommending this over the original."
817,Do not listen to the bad reviews until you watch it for yourself! I loved every minute of it. Not like your typical Disney movie with the princesses singing with the animals in their lalaland. Great action movie that did not 100% follow the original which I like because it's not so predictable. Liu Yi Fei's acting was spectacular! Alot of emotions played.
818,I love the animated version but I still loved this adaptation! It was excellent! I felt it was respectful of Asian culture. I am of Asian descent and while I love the animated version this felt more respectful.
819,"Just watched Mulan with 7 family members, oldest 73, youngest 7, we all absolutely LOVED Mulan. Brilliant film and soundtrack.It is a film that I will never tire of watching.
Well done Disney, fantastic way to spend a family Friday night in."
820,I'm absolutely blown away with how beautiful this movie was. Instead of repeating the same exact story of the cartoon from the 90s (which was riddled with issues and disrespect towards Chinese culture from Mushu to the Emperor bowing for Mulan) this version really tells a story much faithful to the original tale. This is honestly hands down the best disney film since Cinderella (2015).
821,"This is not an exact copy of the animated movie we all love but it does manage to make this live action worth your while.The best part about this story,I think is the dynamic between Liu Yifei and Tzi Ma,acted gracefully and and touching."
822,"The extra stories and characters were perfectly executed. Yifei did amazing as mulan, and gong li's added character helped give a perfect definition of warrior!"
823,"I really loved this movie the effects, the acting, and the action was outstanding. I think this really told the real story of mulan and I'm really glad I got to see it. This movie is a MUST WATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
824,"I haven't seen any previous versions, or read any previous stories of Mulan. This was an enoyable watch, don't come in with crazy expectations. It did what it said it would - told a story and had to add some effects to make relevant in today's effects driven world."
825,"I have watched this movie with my family in my dedicated home theatre room on a projector screen. Why I said this is that the movie experience was somewhat close to watching at a regular theatre. Unfortunately not even my kids enjoy this movie. At least I was expecting some decent fights which was not there. Jet li was just for name sake. There wasn't much role for donny Yen also. I did not feel it unbearable, but there was no grace or charm. From Disney movies I generally expect more, at least for my kids."
826,"This is not a musical. This was a kungfu flick. That's why my son and I loved it. My wife, daughter and aunt were confused. They would hear the beat and start to sing but nope, this is not that movie. So if you want to see some cool fights and action then watch this movie."
827,"This is an average movie. I can't believe it cost $200 million to make this. The visuals aren't indicative of it. It's just not great. It lacks character development. It's awfully long. It feels soulless and empty. This is the kind of thing I expect to be buried on some cable channel.It reminds me of when Hallmark channel did ""Voyage of the Unicorn"" but that movie had good feeling and lacked the budget. That result was good. This movie does the opposite it feels... lacking. It's like they want you to care while watching this but you won't.I think charging $30 for it is the biggest issue. If they aired this as some cable channel broadcast it would go down as a forgettable less good cable release.I mean if you've got 2 hours to waste by all means you can do worse but it's not worth paying to watch. I'll likely forget I watched this in a week or two unless someone mentions it to me."
828,No mishu and not any songs at all. Terrible is truly a compliment for this movie.
829,So my niece and nephew under the age of 10 were bored but not for kids under that age it's for older kids but as an adult I enjoyed
830,"Let's get something right. Disney said all along this was going to differ from the animated movie. No songs, no cricket and yes no Mushu. So knowing this info has been about for two years. Why are people upset and acting shocked at these changes.As far as me and my family. This is up there with Aladdin in the live action cattagory. Really enjoyed it. Beautifuly made, well acted and loved the lil nods to the original but at the same time admired and liked the fact it was its own movie.My 8 year old lil girl loved it. There doesn't need to be a princess, a cute song or a love interest not when you have a strong female lead character as good as this. Well done Disney"
831,Terrible film. Watch the original. Don't waste your money like I did
832,"We watched this movie without having in mind the old animated version, which still makes good memories.For viewers that expected a real version of the old movie, i get the disappointment, but the movie is still good, its not a 1 out of 10 movie.It brings up alot of issues, still present today, like equality beetween men and women, family values, honor, beeing true and remain true to who you are. This is all wrapped in in a good way in the movie. I liked it and it is definately a movie worth watching.Yes, some scenes could be longer and have more depth, also story wise, but there is more to this movie that meets the eye.Its a 7 or 8 out of 10 movie, but ill give it 10 here, to counter all the bad reviews.Also, the ending, how i see it, is made like this so the movie might get a sequeal.Enjoy!"
833,"This movie is absolutly amazing! a great adaptation, great changes, decisons,
it's not the american rubbish that made in 1998, its something completely different!
and what I'm most confused about is the reviews, I saw few reviews about disney's live actions, people talked about how its a shame that disney is trying to make money from the same plot of the same movie, and than they did made completely diferent movies and people still outrages!
this movie was fantastic! and so much better than another china like movies,
it was very mature but still filled up with the same disney magic,
Liu Yifei was absolutly stand out actor, she did great with Mulans character and the fact she did the most of the stunts at least just shows how amazing she is, and than they added a witch, the idea of showing how mulan could take a completely different path to be free, Mulan showed her that its possible to be good and still be yourself.overall, Mulan was very emotonal, powerful, I just loved it,
and people should just try to be a little more open minded for changes."
834,"I have to say how boring and predictable this movie is. the acting is b rate at best.
mulan seems like i blank page with no emotions of her own. even her facial expressions are boring. fight scenes are boring nothing new about them. story line seems all over the place just putting things in to fill the time."
835,"In comparison to 1998 Mulan, this adaptation has no animal side kicks, musical scene and there are changes in character's role. With these changes, i am fulfilled yet thrilled to watch and to finish it. In watching a movie, it is important for the viewers to get thrilled and to find something new or different especially when we talk about movie adaptations. In this years Mulan, innovate changes occur which helps the modern viewers understand the labeling caught by women and the gender role issue which still happens in some areas of the world."
836,"Mulan is my hero.I am deeply moved by the Loyal brave and truth conveyed by the film. I was moved to tears several times by Mulan and her father's love.
I like their performance. It's a great movie and I'd like to watch it again with my children."
837,Watch it with an open mind and don't expect anything. It's very enjoyable if you watch it that way
838,"This movie had beautiful graphics, script writing, female empowerment, and beautiful diversity. If you expect it to be like the animated version, please continue watching the animated one because this story has difference in it. It doesn't have songs, but it is a beautiful and proper movie to watch with friends and family!"
839,"I enjoyed the movie a lot and watched it twice in one night. There are a few reasons why I love it so much1. First, it was well directed to show the struggles of being a woman during that period. For example, Mulan was told to hide her ""chi"", which simply meant her potential to be a good warrior since she was little. However, when she changed her identity to that of a man, her strong ""chi"" suddenly brought her a lot of recognition and compliments. The movie was directed well to show this contrast.2. Second, the movie brought attention to the value of love of your family, being true to yourself and your friends, and loyal to your your country. They are all very important values for life and you hardly see any movies that talk about all of them well. It's a good movie to watch with your kids.3. Third, I think Disney did a great job casting each role. The actress selected to play Mulan has the type of beauty which appeals to both the east and the west. And she has a martial arts background. She did well in all the fight scenes. All the other characters they selected also fit well and were made vivid. I adored Mulan's father. He played the mix feelings of being happy for her daughter's talent but also worried about her not being accepted by society. I am also very impressed by Bori Khan. He looks exactly like the Bori Khan, I imagined.My suggestion is to watch this movie without comparing it to the animated version. Luckily I already forgot that version since it was a long time ago. Mulan has been a famous story for centuries in Chinese history. The actual recorded story is very short. Basically, it only mentioned a woman named Mulan who replaced her father to fight a war since she had no brothers and her father was aging. Due to how short the story is, a lot is left to the imagination for whoever wants to tell the story. I personally think it's great that Disney made the second movie different from the first one. If they made it exactly the same, i'm not sure i would want to pay to watch just a live action version.Overall, I enjoyed the movie a lot. If you have two people watch movie together, $29.99 is a reasonable price. I had two others watch movie with me and we watched it twice, so it's actually cheaper than paying for movie tickets."

841,"I mostly liked this movie, it had incredible cinematography, moving moments, a story that was paced well; but, there was something missing, it felt a little hollow? It's still worth a watch, and youll come away entertained, but wishing there was more. It wasn't worth a 9 but more than a 7."
842,"Firstly, I think it's worth mentioning that this is the first Mulan movie that I've watched. So I'm judging it as a stand-alone movie.I think the cinematography is amazing. However:1. I found it incredibly boring. Notably - I didn't feel any connection to the characters, or relate to their feelings / motivations.2. It's not really clear what genre this movie is trying to be. Does it want to be serious, or funny? Because the jokes fell flat.3. I feel that the fantasy element that they were going for didn't really fit. There was no real context provided as to whether these characters are human or not. But for some reason, people could fight Matrix style; and some characters could shapeshift. It kinda felt like the writers randomly meshed together ideas from different movies, and I'm not sure that it worked.One final thing to mention - I ended up watching the cartoon version immediately after. And wow, what a contrast. The animated one is so much better! Notably, this new version is missing some key characters & scenes that I feel would have benefited the storyline."
843,"I'm super offended by how Disney portrays this ""Chinese"" story."
844,"It's sincerely made. All the cast are excellent. It is gorgeously shot, and the story line, while silly, is still entertaining. So I would be more encouraging than being nasty."
845,Disney really does a good job of putting the viewer into ancient china. the costumes and imperial city were wow!
846,"A really great movie, there is no wasted time waiting for it. The movie is so good and beautiful, I absolutely love the spectacular battle scenes of Mulan. I also liked the scenes where Mulan was with her family, the scene with her father was extremely emotional.The way the film honors the women is also amazing. There is no need to lift somebody by drowning someone. When you have the talent and dare to show it off, you deserve to be at the top no matter who you are.I also liked the movie because there weren't too many gore scenes. Young children need not watch too violent and bloody things. So this movie is perfect for families, for children.The film is coherent in content, easy to understand for children, many elements of family bonding, and has many good messages. the most valuable movie this year!"
847,"I expected it to be bad after reading the reviews, but its completely unworthy of it. The movie was good in my opinion, colorful and good quotes. It made me tear up several times, although several iconic shots were cut, like Mulan cutting her hair. But overall I didnt mind, I liked the characters more than I thought I would and I liked that the movie took its time going into details and not just brushing over things, for example Mulan's stay with the soldiers and her struggle fitting in and taking a bath and sleeping etc. I would watch it again. I especially love the father character."
848,"I have seen 3 times! It's worthy to watch it with $30
I am a fan of the mulan liuyifei now. She is brilliant!"
849,"OK, so this is vaguely reminiscent of the Mulan original...the characters, the storyline... BUT theres no songs (Although some subtle instrumental versions) and no Mushu.. ""dishonour on your cow!""
As a stand alone film,its lovely... Folk on here are just miffed they paid extra to see it and didn't get exactly like the animated version...
I recommend watching Mulan."
850,"For me, this is like the Avengers movie. I wont get tired of watching Mulan over and over again!"
851,"Absolutely stunning and I (almost) cried several times during the last half of the movie. I was surprised to find out that the main actor is actually 33 years old, playing a teenaged girl. The story was excellent and worth the wait. Based on its own merits, I really enjoyed the movie. Go buy the DVD and watch it over & over!"
852,"Really sad situation,people extremely judgmental and unpleasant...This is a Disney film,it's a legend a magical fairy tale,where goodness always defeats badness ...so what is wrong with it?????It's a film for children and it does a beautiful job in teaching them about honor,family,tradition and honesty...
Unfortunately it is only grown ups ,who watch the film with prejustice and try to kill all the joys of childhood.All the children of all my friends and family absolutely loved it!!!Most of the adults too!!!Absolutely amazing film!!!
10 stars to support,in reality a very strong 8!!!"
853,"The level of idiocy in this movie is simply unrealistic. I do not recommend viewing by people over 5 years old. Otherwise, your brains will flow out of your head because of all the insanity that the writers came up with. The only thing that succeeded in this film is the scenery."
854,This was just plain awful !! I wish Disney would stop ruining my childhood to remake the classics .Save your money .Edit : the child actresses who played Mulan and her sister were terrible . In the Disney film Mulan never had a sister .I didn't like the actress who played older Mulan either .
855,"I loved the 1998 Mulan, even as an adult. It was an inspiring story of bravery, defying conventions, transformation, hard work, and being true to yourself. It was also hilarious due to Mushu, the little dragon.The 2020 remake is just a dull and pointless movie. Even the fight scenes were more about defying the laws of physics than about actual fighting skills.1) Mulan has been turned into a superhero who was born with superhuman powers. This is problematic for many reasons: a) She never has to suffer and work hard to learn new skills -- these were just natural gifts to her. This eliminates much of the personal growth story of the original. Literally the only growth that Mulan experiences during the entire movie is that she decides to admit being a woman and not to hide her fighting skills anymore. b) The original movie was much more realistic and easier to digest. In the original, Mulan used her wits to defeat the enemy: launching an avalanche etc. This is the way a young girl actually could have a big impact in the war. But in the remake, she physically wields a sword and almost single-handedly cuts down an army of trained male soldiers. I'm not saying movies have to be totally realistic, but at some point it just becomes ridiculous.2) The fight scenes are all about flying, catching flying arrows with bare hands, kicking flying spears toward your enemies, etc., which totally defies the laws of physics. This is an unfortunate attempt to copy the traditional Chinese martial arts movies that are all about flying and abandoning any sense of realism. Note that this is tradition that Bruce Lee went against -- he wanted to make all fight scenes and moves realistic. As someone who is passionate about martial arts, I love the Bruce Lee approach but cringe at this supernatural approach.3) The ideology in the movie is in-your-face authoritarianism. Everything is about unquestioning obedience to the ruler -- it's all about loyalty, honor (defined by the ruler), and self-sacrifice. No one EVER asks what Mulan wants, nor does she express any desire of her own, except to serve her ruler and country and honor her family. Even the prospect of having found love (personal goal) is basically eliminated from the remake. One low point is when Mulan totally pointlessly offers herself up for execution, having broken the rule against women in the military (but not serving any sensible purpose, not even helping anyone else in any way) -- this is just a model of absolute obedience.Meanwhile, the ruler is shown as another supernatural martial arts expert who also deeply cares about the people of China. He is a wise and benevolent dictator -- basically a perfect human. There is absolutely no hint of corruption or personal vanity.4) In general, the movie was just not good at some many levels. The phoenix looked like a drone covered with a few ugly rags and it was very clumsily woven into the story. Pretty much all characters were robotic. Adding a shape-shifting almost all-powerful witch also was an unfortunate and unnecessary thing. And the witch's decisions at the end just came out of the blue and made no sense for her.The only good thing about the remake was that was really beautiful in terms of scenery, costumes, etc.Overall, I really wish I had not supported this movie by shelling out $30 for it. We really don't need more movies like this."
856,"Take everything you liked about the original Mulan and throw it out the window. There is no comedy, no singing, none of the same characters except Mulan, and rather than her having to struggle to ""become a man"" she just has magical powers that she just simply decides to use. This was a cheesy 80s Kung Fu movie that was loosely based around the plot of Mulan. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. On par with the Avatar: The Last Airbender movie and the Percy Jackson movies"
857,"Despite the controversy, this movie made a great point about feminism. I hope those parents especially in China, India, and Middle East will have a chance to watch this movie and think twice before killing their unborn baby girls."
858,"This movie is atrocious. It takes the wonderful original and flips it into a modern version from hell. It's insulting to young women it's insulting to the viewer. The lead character is one-dimensional and shallow and, apparently, is infallible because she is a woman. The entire ""chi"" concept is ridiculous here. Even the antagonist is flipped halfway through because she is a female. This is the definition of woke nonsense and they don't even understand why people will hate this entire movie. It's not because it's female empowering. It's just the opposite. It belittles the character and it insults the viewer."
859,"The cinematography top notch, the action passable, the story average..I have seen far superior Hong Kong films on a lesser budget and with superior action(ironically all staring Donnie Yen, Jet Li and Yu Liufei ). So let's talk about the film..It's was alright...Sets, costumes, scenery great, acting did it's job..What was missing? CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT for the lesser characters that are pivotal to make Mulan a more powerful character. It did feel slightly rushed towards the end, but it was you know just alright."
860,"Overated. After the battle there wasn't even a scratch on those soldiers, this and cursed in the same basket"
861,Cheap representation. The character of the heroine is very weak and does not show any reaction. Stupid and distracting scenario.
862,"Probably the worst movie that Disney made.👎🏻 The Mulan cartoon(1998) are classic one, not Mulan(2020)"
863,"Mulan proves once again that Disney hopes people will go see this movie because they have fond memories of the animation movie, only to crush those memories with another piece of live-action garbage. Save yourself this agony and just watch the animation movie again."
864,"The movie is good, I dont understand why the rate is 5,6, it deserves more than that."
865,"Entertaining movie but very stock standard family adventure movie.This movie doesn't need to be boycotted and I don't see why it's necessary for that. Again that's one of the stupid social society marketing ploys that people do to get attention.This movie gives it a fair go but just doesn't hit the beats on time.Acting was lacking emotional depth, overall characters performances are bland, story is very standard cliche, too much wire and CG work and shame we don't see more Jet Li and Donnie Yen have enough time for better cinematic Kung Fu magic on screen.The movie had potential but very undercooked.If you have nothing better to watch or do and just want some mindless entertainment, then give this one a go."
866,"I was thinking i was going to be fine without Mushu and was disappointed at the idea that it wasn't a musical, but i still had my hopes up. This is just sad! It's boring and the stupid crouching Tiger hidden dragon chi powers is so stupid. Honestly you can change the names and you couldn't even tell it wasn't just a generic Chinese movie. Then there were Times where it just felt rushed or poorly put together."
867,"You've probably already seen all the bad reviews here so I'll cut straight to the point. I agree with many of them. Didn't really have that classic Disney magic, very much physics defying stunts, and most of all, a lacklustre emotional story. Whilst I do understand that this film was made for the general public who might care more for the theatrics than the emotional side of the story, I believe that the emotional story really is an untapped potential of this film.Personally, I found this film to be more comedy than any other genre, though it was probably due to the atmosphere I was watching it in. Sitting with my family and watching this film, being able to critique each and everything that happens without being shushed by other movie goers will definitely be a fond memory of mine that I have made. Whilst there were many mistakes in this film, I believe that the cast is not one of them. The acting was superb. With a better execution, this film would have probably been an amazing film.Hence, I will say that while this film has had many mistakes, for the general public, you might not find it so bad. Also, I'd definitely recommend this as a film for the family to have fun and bond in this tough times for this film simply gives you so much ammunition for critique. After all, isn't having a great time watching a movie the whole point of watching it?"
868,"I spent the $31.34 (after taxes) for the premiere access to watch it with my daughter and we were not disappointed. If you're going into this thinking its going to be a children's comedy then sure you're going to be disappointed. However, if you're a fan of the old school kung fu movies or even the crouching tiger hidden dragon film it runs in a similar vein. With the impossible high flying action sequences and nods to the witchcraft (think white-haired witch) it is a great movie to introduce your children into this magical genre. Don't believe the negative reviews until you have watched the movie itself."
869,Can't explain how I feel about this film. Those excellent actors and actresses could be more in this movie. I don't understand the make up of Gongli.
870,"This movie was an absolute failure in my mind. The acting was off, the visuals were clunky and off, the choreography in fighting was off, the humor just wasn't there, and this whole new element of chi just felt off. They are trying so hard to pander to the modern standards of political correctness. THIS ISN'T ABOUT MODERN TIMES. Disney's huge stretch to not cause offense in any way shape or form IS ITSELF the offense. I felt myself having to look away from the screen shaking my head multiple times. I seriously felt I was watching a lower budgeted bollywood film. Where things just feel out of place and choreography was exaggerated. Out of all the remakes they have done for these disney cartoons. THIS was the worst. I understand not being able to keep all elements of the original movies. But at least on the other remakes they tried to stick with the theme and original movie"
871,The lead character has no emotion. I honestly cannot believe why they picked her. She is incapable of showing any emotion especially at the last fight scene. Total waste of money. I had to watch the animated version after again just to feel good.
872,"Looked interesting enough to watch, but my kids got bored and I started to fall asleep. Seemed like ""Rise of the Skywalker"" mixed with old Mulan in they tried to hard to show shades of the old to mix with the new, but falls very short. Plus no songs or Mushu. Save yourself the time and $30."
873,Poor choice of actress. This movie has damaged the image of Mulan who supposed to be tough and powerful. Better spend your time on other movie.
874,"A lot of people have been berating #boycott but for what reason? For wanting to make the millions they spent making the movie? Seems normal! I do think asking people to pay about $30 is a bit steep, but they should have waiting for theatres to open and release it next year.
Looking like everyone is just joining the ""hate mulan"" bandwagon. Why is it that when there is a movie about a strong woman ppl always want to hate on it? Smells like sexism to me.
The movie was good and the actress did a fab job. I do think they could have made it better and stayed true to the actual Chinese folktale."
875,"The truth is that, the movie diverged from the cartoon but it doesn't mean it was bad does it? I mean won't you be bored to see the same events as in the cartoons?
I think the story was great, all the characters that were added compliment the story. I love how the plot was built around the main character even though it would have been good to show us a background story of the antagonist and the woman who was fighting along side him. But that's not a plothole because you will get to understand their background story from their conversations.
I have watched the cartoons before but I couldn't hold my tears in the ending part of the movie."
876,"This movie really impressed me. I love the spirit shown in the movie. A girl should be loyal, brave and true like Mulan."
877,"Mulan is a beautiful film, wonderful action scenes, and wins by not having a soundtrack sung by the characters as in ""The Lion King"" of 2019. I don't understand the hatred of some about this film which is one of the best of 2020."
878,"While many movies have been postponed these past months, finally the release of Mulan was worth the wait. Great movie. Much different from the animated classic. There are no songs, no Mushu and no comic relief. It is a straight forward action adventure drama that delivers. So far, it is my favorite and best movie of the year. People who reviewed it that were disappointed and calling it a bad movie don't know what the hell they're talking about. This movie was better without the songs. It wouldn't have been the same and would not have fit in as just a copy of the animated Mulan. I like the animated film too, but I liked the live action version even more. There are great battle scenes and Mulan is fun to watch in action. So if you're a fan of the original and expect to hear songs and get comic relief from Mushu, you probably won't like it. I would love to have seen this on the big screen. It was definitely made for it. An epic that is one of the best if not the best movie of the year!"
879,This Disney one of the best movie. Watch it without an hesitation.
880,Exactly what the new wave of 'hit or miss' live action adaptations needed!
881,This movie was so great I've watched it twice in the last 24 hours! I loved the action. Anyone who loved the original will recognize the music from Reflection during key moments. Cricket was adorable and it was nice to see a movie where romance wasn't important for the main character. Well done Disney!
882,Easily one of the best live action movies based on a animated movie. Disney did a great job! Much and much better then for example The Lion King. Everything about this movie is good. Well done.
883,"I see that many reviews are berating this film for not following the animation more, but instead of hoping for a frame-by-frame reshoot like The Lion King, I would say have an open mind going into this. After all, I doubt the original Chinese legend had Eddie Murphy in mind to play a role. I haven't seen the 1998 animation, so I cannot draw comparison.The film starts a little slow, but bare with it, after about half an hour it kicks in. It's refreshing to see a cast purely of the ethnicity intended for the story, rather than having one Westerner to play a key role to the plot. Scenery is impressive and worth a mention for the visual appreciation it can cause. There are cheesy moment in there for sure, and some of the acrobatics can be on the borderline too. Having not grown up with this type of cinema apparent in my culture, it can be easy to scoff at some of the 'stunts', flipping up everything possible and frequently running up walls, and to be fair, at times the way these are shot are a little cringe-worthy. However, this is a way of bringing Eastern and Western cinema together, incorporating important elements of each type of film.You may not like this film because there is no dragon, it isn't a musical, and a witch has been added (somewhat unnecessarily), but you have to appreciate that this is ultimately a Disney film. This is for children to enjoy. Personally, I very much appreciate how a different culture is given the limelight, with a cast (mostly) unknown outside of Eastern cinema. Give kids something a little different to watch, and see what they think of it, instead of trashing a film based on your childhood memories."
884,"Well, with this 2020 live action movie version of the classic ""Mulan"" tale, I must admit that my expectations were set up rather high. Especially so since I do like the tale and were looking forward to seeing what director Niki Caro could muster with this project.And now that I have seen ""Mulan"" I can say that I was entertained, sure. But this movie was by no means the grand movie that I had hoped for. Now, don't get me wrong here, because the movie is enjoyable and watchable, but it was just lacking something to make it pop out and be unique and outstanding. Especially when you hold ""Mulan"" up against the endless number of similar movies of Chinese epics that are made in China and Hong Kong.What the 2020 ""Mulan"" had working for it was first and foremost the familiarity of the storyline and plot. But also the cast ensemble, that really impressed me. I mean, ""Mulan"" has the likes of Yifei Liu, Donnie Yen, Li Gong, Jet Li, Jason Scott Lee, Rosalind Chao, Tzi Ma and Xana Tang on the cast list, just to mention the most familiar of performers. And yeah, I was thrilled that they gave Yifei Liu the role of Mulan, because she is a great actress and have some really impressive martial arts epics to her resumé, and she carried the Mulan role quite well. I have to admit that it was nice to see Jet Li on the screen again. One performance that really blew me away was Jason Scott Lee as the villain, wow. His performance as this characters was phenomenal.And one cannot watch ""Mulan"" without taking in all the breathtaking scenery and sets. From the majestic landscapes to the small villages, it was just spectacular to look at. And it was so obvious that the props people had definitely worked well at their tasks, because there were so many nice details and things to observe. And also the costumes and props should be commended here, because they definitely also worked wonderfully.Visually, then I have to say that ""Mulan"" is spectacular to look at. Not only the landscapes and sets, but also the cinematography as a whole. The way the action sequences and martial arts sequences are filmed and presented to the audience, where you can feel the action and how dynamic it all is. At times it felt like you were right there in the frame with the cast.Something that I had problems coping with in the 2020 version of ""Mulan"" was the fact that everyone spoke English. It just took away so much authenticity from the movie. Sure, this was a Disney project, but come on. You can't set a movie in an ancient Chinese dynasty and have everyone speak English. It was just such a stupid thing, and it was cringeworthy that the writers had opted for this. If they had spoken Mandarin, as they were supposed to, the movie would have been all the more enjoyable.Now, one can argue for or against the lack of Mushu in the movie. You know, the quirky dragon from the animated movie, voiced by Eddie Murphy. Sure, I was missing it in the movie, but I think it was a good thing that the writers didn't include Mushu, because it would have been a distracting element that would have taken away focus from the movie as being a serious movie. I believe if they had added Mushu to the live action movie here, it would have dragged down the movie. It pains me to say, because Mushu is the most enjoyable character in the animated movie, and I love the character quite a bit. However, they added a phoenix instead, but it doesn't really interact with Mulan or speak to her, but it worked well, because it was a representation of her ancestry, and it was just beautiful to look at.All in all, ""Mulan"" is an entertaining movie for sure, and I would have rated it a seven star rating if they had not opted to go for the English language being spoken. I enjoyed ""Mulan"" and it is definitely a good movie. My rating, however, lands on a six out of ten stars, because of the language issue."
885,"So, Mulan now has chi and is basically unstoppable without any real need of training. Why? Wasn't it a better story and moral to show that she was weak and needed to work hard to become a warrior? They took out fan favorites like mushu claiming to try to be more realistic but then add a witch... ??? Wtf?"
886,"I love Disney, and almost all the remakes are great. Except for this one. Mulan 2020 is one of the worst movie made by Disney.Liu Yifei - much like Kristen Stewart in her early days in Twilight - poor actings, almost same expression in every emotion. Script, poorly written. And poorly executed.I feel like Disney has gone too far. Maybe it needs to slow everything down, and try to put extra effort and attention make small numbers but great movie."
887,"This film relied heavily on the audience already being familiar with Mulan. Specifically the original Disney film. They borrowed bits and pieces and all it did was remind me how much better the original was.Mulan is meant to be an odd girl. An independent thinker. Creative, intelligent and loyal. The animated film created a character girls could strive to be like. This version made a chosen one story where girls can be as good as guys if they have mega-powerful chi. This movie says to even be on par with men you basically have to be a witch.You can't even enjoy the fight scenes as mindless action. I love some lady kicking butt scenes, but I couldn't get into these.The wire work looks dreadful. The slow motion was overdone and only exacerbated the problem with the fake fighting.Also why do girls have to do action scenes with their hair down? They made a big point of her stupidly going into battle without her armour or helmet which in real life is the fastest way to get killed. The reason they did that was so she could look pretty and graceful while she kicked butt.The more I think about this film, the worse it gets. A film should get better with contemplation. Waste of money. This film hurt the small girl in me who grew up loving Mulan."
888,It's a really beautiful movie. Locations are breath-taking. Every detail is well taken-care of. It's not perfect but way beyond expectations.
889,"I loved the story, as I loved the animated one. This is a live version, and you can't expect to be the same as the animated. It is well related. It is a great movie to watch with the family; has great values and inspires to have the family as the core of the values in a person. Something that is really lost these days. The fight scenes are great, the locations, the characters.. it was a very good movie."
890,"This is a big failure. Acting is so bad, actors and actress can't express charactesr's feeling. I watched the animated movie and this disappointed me so much"
891,"While the cinemetography and plot deviation from the original really started to make this a unique experience - the longer the film went on, the less immersive the film felt.Gorgeous decor can only go so far. In the case of the new Watership Down series, although the animation was quite poor, I kept on watching because the story and the characters were fascinating and I really cared about them all.In the case of this - the lead actress was wooden (Gong Li, who is brilliant in this, should have been cast as Mulan instead) and her journey was uninspiring - with the writers making her an Avenger with little time to get to know her, rather than a normal girl who triumphs over all physical and social opposition.Please, just give me a Disney remake I can sink my teeth into, that makes me feel wondrous and fulfilled by the end. Otherwise what is even the point of remaking the film if you can't find anything to improve on it?"
892,"I don't understand why they introduced ""Chi"" in this movie. It is totally unnecessary and made Mulan a Skywalker-like character. Mulan is not supposed to be the chosen one with special powers. She is a 100% self-made woman, which is vividly portrayed in the Ballad of Mulan. Obviously, the filmmakers do not understand the core of this character. This movie alienates the audience instead of resonating among them."
893,"The view and expectations towards women in asian cultures was well portrayed in the film. The art in focusing on the realistic view of the story was inspiring. The scenery, action sequence, and martial arts was amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that Mulan wasn't westernized in the way people had wanted to was very empowering because too often foreign stories are westernized and molded to fit the western agenda. The cast and acting was superb. The theme of bringing ""HONOR"" is very important to asian culture so it's refreshing to feel understood thus the constant reminder throughout the film was important. Mulan was the FIRST story to show how a WOMAN fought to be seen and treated as an equal by defying traditions, ignoring public opinions, and being honest to herself by being herself openly. This film was very empowering!!"
894,Forget about the horrible review and go see the movie for yourself. It's sad that such a great movie receives terrible reviews from people who wanted it to be EXACTLY like the original.
895,"This movie lacks creativity, and it fails to develop the characters. I think the ballad has lost its soul when it is performed as a movie."
896,"Damn, i don't understand why the user's critics are so bad like come on... the story is great, the actors are great, there's a good moral and I overall really ENJOYED IT! It doesn't have to be copy-paste the old Mulan, it's a remake not a 1900s version."
897,"I never saw the original 1998 cartoon Mulan so I have nothing to compare this to and had no expectations going in. I watched with my children who have seen the original. We all loved this. I was very moved by the story line, felt connected to the characters, and felt it was visually beautiful. 10/10 would recommend!"
898,"Let me start by saying if you expected this live-action version as a straight frame by frame ""remake/carbon copy of the animated movie by Disney, stop reading here. This to me seems closer to the legendary story of Mulan, a person if she was ONE person or perhaps an amalgamation of female warriors throughout Chinese History. The story is brought to life without the usual Dance and Song that usually calls to the viewer you are watching a Disney movie. I think this was a bold and fresh take on the story as a whole. The actors chosen were thoughtful and if you have watched Martial Arts Films in the last 30 years, you will recognize more than a few legends in the film.The film is mard by political issues that in no small part costed the Studio some $$$ and marked for audience loss. I will leave to you the reader to research this part. I put it here only as a mention because I think the reviews by others is a way to tarnish the film as punishment for the actions of actors and studio alike not the quality of the film and the storytelling.The acting is very good in my opinion. The action is superb, the pace is excellent, and the casting is extraordinary (NO WHITE-WASHING AT ALL) A Chinese legendary story acted by Chinese actors.)I hope you the reader will take my words to heart and watch the film. You may completely disagree with me and that is fine, I am not a film critic by trade. I am a movie lover and history obsessed person. I think this is a great mix of the two and wonderful for the family as Disney intended.
This is not the only good Mulan film out there but this is a great one from the Animation to Action Genre."
899,"One of the best Disney remake movies i have ever seen. I was very disappointed when i read the bad reviews. I don't know why people didn't like it!The girl playing Mulan was amazing, passionate and she was the best fit for the role. Well done!!! The scenery was mesmerising. Also i liked the fact that the movie was not identical with the actual Disney movie because it made it unique and interesting!!! I highly recommend it!!!"
900,"This movie felt nothing like a Disney movie. There are Netflix originals way better than this. Ridiculous, over the top, unnecessary characters, lacking all feeling and emotion. Lacking the songs we like so much. No dragon or cricket...."
901,Total flop from the very beginning... changing the story in all the worst ways. Disney needs to realize the generation who grew up with the original wants a live action remake. Not a loose rendition. Such a disappointment. Hopefully they will realize that soon and stop ruining these live action films.
902,"I have never watched any other version of Mulan, so i went in fresh
Great film, who cares if it doesn't match the other versions ??Stop moaning
Top filmI'm shocked at its low rating, from miserable people 😕"
903,"I did comment on the director IG about my disappointment in MULAN, for her future improvement. Guess what, she deleted my comment & block my account ! Leaving all good & praises in her comment sections. Wow !MULAN is not bad, its WORST ! Ruining my fav Disney 1998 classic with USD200 mil budget. This director going places !!"
904,"Mind-blowing fighting scenes, picturesque scenes, beautiful story-telling. The overall IMDb rating of 5.4 is not at all justified for this incredibly beautiful movie. One of the reason for this poor rating is because people compare it with the old animation movie. I wonder why is it necessary to compare every movie with its old animated version? Why cannot one just watch such a movie with a completely fresh perspective?
Shame on people who rate such a wonderful work of art with 1 star or 2 star? People accept magic and all sorts of unrealistic things in an animation, but when such components are added to movies with real characters, people do not like it. I think as an audience we need to accept it as another work of art, judging it by the acting of the characters, the freshness in story telling and beautiful direction. Please stop comparing it to the animation movie and giving it such a bad rating. This movie deserves much more."
905,"Unlike the disney cartoon, this was disneys worse remake yet. No mushu, crazy strong mary sue who fights every battle like its nothing, no journey to becoming who shes meant to be, she just has the powrr of 'chi' and can defeat anyone in combat from day 1. Battles are absolutely boring and horrible. No character has a purpose except mulan who defeats anyone in her path at ease, they added some fat guy named cricket to replace the cricket. Cringe. Even the beginning when she takes her fathers sword had zero emotion to it compared to the cartoon. Truly awful movie."
906,It was very boring and shang and mushu weren't even in it smh bye
907,"I had no expectations for this movie what so ever but was surprised in a good way. The cinematography is amazing. The story great and the casting of Mulan spot on.
I think this is by far the best of the converted animated movies yet!"
908,"It's difficult to comprehend how this film ended up as such a train wreck (aka JOHN CARTER). It comes off as utterly unbelievable and unrelatable. As a remake, conceptually, this was a disaster and I'm not sure who would actually find this appealing."
909,"The movie is not that bad (not even close), as the one star ratings say. I liked it, it was fun, with loads of my favorite actors. However, if you have certain expectations towards the similarity to the cartoon, sure, you can be disappointed, but this is NOT the cartoon (yes, Mulan the cartoon still exists, and it can be watched, and you can sign-along).
So, just sit, relax and watch it - you might actually enjoy it."
910,"It had a bit of an amateur dress up party look to it. Sceneries were beautiful though. Score was great as you would expect from a disney movie. It was just missing something to make it a great movie, not really sure what."
911,"With the pandemic affecting movie theaters, ""Mulan""'s action scenes could have been so much better on the big screen. That said, the theatrical experience, or lack there of, made us suffer with a 30$ movie that is inferior (in almost every way) to the original."
912,"I was most definitely disappointed with version...with all the other live action movies hitting the nail on head. This one totally missed. I can't believe how they Butchered. This movie No music , No Ancestors, No Dragon. They even gave a person the cricket part. Totally waste."
913,"Absolute trash. Do yourself and your children a favor, stick to the original Disney classic. The original animation had it all: drama, humor, great soundtrack and a likeable cast of characters. You cared for Mulan. A woman born into a patriarchal society who made the decision to disguise herself as a man in order to save her disabled father from going to war. She did this for the honor of her family, which is a foreign concept to most of us in the West.Through the film she struggled. 2020 Mulan gave her character superpowers essentially. In the original, she was no warrior. She was never trained and had no ""secret chi powers"" to speak of. At one point, she was kicked out of training and told she was unteachable. Instead of giving up, she rallied back and proved her strength. 2020 Mulan has NONE of this. She's overpowered from the start. He only struggle is attempting to hide the fact that she's outright on another level from her male peers.2020 Mulan strips away everything that made the original film a timeless classic. Modern day Disney is a soulless joke. A hollowed out husk of a once great and innovative company. One again I say, stick to the original animations. Not just of Mulan but of every Disney classic. Your kids will thank you. You'll thank yourself."
914,"This film was never intended to replace the animated version, and thankfully does not attempt to. I enjoyed this film immensely- but I watched it with an open mind as a stand-alone story, not as an exact re-telling of the original. With excellent performances from the entire cast and amazing stunts from Yifei Liu and veteran Donnie Yen (whose sheer speed with his swordplay alone is incredible), alongside breathtaking cinematography, I have to say this film is a favorite of mine. Yes, there are surreal elements to this film (as seen in Hero and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), so there is implied, heightened storytelling rather than obvious or overt humor and plot. So if you can remain open-minded, this is a worthy film. If you want to see the original- rewatch the animation!"
915,"This movie didn't need to happen, but since it did, 2020 was the perfect year to release it. Without giving away too much, lets just say, Mulan 2020 has magic chi so there's no following this character as she improves and grows like in the animated version. There was no female empowerment message. Mulan basically spends the entire time trying to hide how exceptional (since birth) she already is compared to the boys. Ugh what a boring af train wreck of a movie."
916,"I made a profile after watching this movie... first the Pros- the cinematography
Cons- everything else
Let's be honest, this movie wasn't trying to be realistic. They just wanted to please the Chinese money that paid for this terrible film! The film looks cheap, the acting is pandering and just awful. They take a beloved animated movie and ruin it. They claim to want realism, apparently chi is real, and so is running up walls, turning into birds and shape shifting lol. The thing that made the animated film so amazing was Mulan going from a clumsy, insecure, but smart girl to a strong, secure and empowering female lead! The scene that has Mulan use her brains to climb and retrieve the arrow is brilliant! Wasn't in the movie... Forget not having a funny dragon to lighten the mood, every scene except for two are serious and over acted."
917,"So, if you want to compare this live action movie to the original,then be prepared to get insulated. The overtrying that is put into this movie's story is absurd. And even then, they didn't let the story manifest in anyway. Instead they are presenting their ""2020"" activist aspect through a heroine. Mulan, once one of the most brave Disney princesses, is being ripped , as she doesn't have to try and fight for what the original movie Mulan did .
The editing is worthless ,gave me a bad headache and the cgi had nothing to add to it whatsoever. And lastly , this new Disney that's working on these live action movies HAS to decide to either commit to the bloody songs or not embed them at all to them movie. I don't won't to spoil , but so far this live action move has done the worst job so far regarding the songs ( let's not remember how ""be prepared"" got a smack in the face as well .....) . If someone wants to not compare these two movies , then again the characters are so hollow , they don't contribute in any way and the adds in the film like the phoenix instead of mushu ,or Mulan arachnophobia etc just didn't help the story grow. In general , I would love if Disney just quit making these movies, cus apparently they can't do any better ."
918,"'Disney movie is special for their musicals
What is mulan without musicals' -epic asian- ...
well said... 😏😏😏I was waiting for the songs that I always sing along like reflection, bring honor to us all, i'll make a man out of you... 😔😔😔And another point is... it is not 'Disney' Mulan without Mushu and the lucky Cricket... 😢😢😢
If we want a serious one we will watch Mulan (2009) starring Zhao Wei...we wanted to watch Disney live action Mulan.Plus in the cartoon Mulan is a smart and intelligent woman who could even fight in a battle field if she tries not a superwoman like the live-action remake... 😢For me...this is the worst live-action remake from Disney...Mulan Cartoon is one of my favourite fairy tales and they ruined it in the live-action...😭"
919,"Demeritizing men does not increase the value and position of women. Disney had brought women power too far, making this movie so ridiculous. The storyline was removed everything important, and what make Mulan (animated version) a good movie.The bad acting of Yifei Liu completely makes Mulan a really horrible live-action movie. I don't understand why she was chosen to be the main actress of this movie.Totally not recommend. Wasted time."
920,"Not as funny and full of fantasy as the animated version, not as realistic, gritty and emotional as the chinese version. Trying to be both but failing horribly. Absolutely forgetable."
921,"Really bad, they introduced chi, which made mulan have a natural born talent."
922,I think the main character looks like a robot. No feeling in her face. I regret for watching this movie. :(
923,"Everything is wrong with the movie. If you change the soundtrack a bit, it seems more like a mocking movie (like scary movie series) than an actual Mulan."
924,I was expecting so much more from this movie. Every about it was off. One of the worst Disney movies in my opinion
925,"Another forgetful disney remake! surprise! but this one takes the cake as the worst. what even is this the purpose of this film. they made this pg-13 and promised to make this more real (therefore they took out the music and mushu). but then the the movie starts off with the reveal that mulan has certain powers. who made this choice?? the whole point of mulan is that she is just a normal girl who wants to save her father so she makes a brave and noble choice to join the war. so all these emotional and impactful scenes from the first movie (such as when mulan climbs to the top of that post) are just thrown away. in this film we don't really want to root for mulan, she is not really relatable and just plain boring. there is also this random spirit lady (again this is not more realistic just more boring) that just makes no sense and seems like an afterthought. overall this film drags on. would not recommend, go watch the original one :))"
926,I had to keep reminding myself that it's not a movie remake but it's own thing.I thought the actors did a good job portraying their characters.The special effects should be up for a zillion awards.
927,"It's not a Mulan, just lame Chinese movie. Mulan is Mongolian, not from mainland China. Many characters are deleted, no songs...Is this really a Mulan movie? so disappointed."
928,"This is not Mulan. This is something else, I don't know what to call it but it is not the Mulan I loved as a kid. Not even close"
929,"Hot garbage. Another live action Disney movie based on an animated classic that no one asked for. There are very very little similarities to the original , no mushu and absolutely no original songs. Just watch the original and avoid this trash"
930,"The only thing that this movie did right was it made me watch the original Mulan again. There is no soul and depth in the characters. You want to re-create a serious Mulan, that's fine. But remember, serious doesn't mean soulless. The acting, especially the lead actress, is unbearable. Gong Li, Jet Li and Jason did a pretty good job, though.
It's bad. I think the other reviews said enough. Really, do yourself a favor and save your $30."
931,"Don't listen to the poor reviews! Don't compare this to the animated version. This did not feel like a ""Disney"" movie but it was still really good. The live action Mulan was made to be more culturally actuate! That being said give it a chance!"
932,"Boring and soulless movie not to mention poor acting, awkward dialogues and awful editing that makes experienced viewer sick. Nothing remains from original movie - no character development, no humor, no fantasy characters, no songs."
933,"A very disney movie but without musical opera this time it's 132827402029172 times worse. The only feminist thing is that Mulan is fighting as a woman, and by that you can see the screenwriter's gall. if this was based on a western story i guess this movie can be criticized to the point where the director team takes the lead to apologize. honestly i doubt whether the crew has read 'the ballad of mulan' cuz even if they only read the first line they wouldn't come out with such a stupid setting of 'chi'. when i saw mulan could only use chi when she admits that she's a woman... i was like what the hell?!?!?
seriously, if you're looking for a movie that contains chinese kung fu or martial arts, there are a ton of great chinese ones as long as you can read the subtitles. if you're looking for a movie that has great visual effects, there are thousands of hollywood movies that worth expecting.
but shout out to gong li for being the only one that seems to have acting skills."
934,"Very dazzling. Worth watching it in theaters. Yes, could be better but the bad reviews are just taking it for too much that's why I'm giving it a 10."
935,"I am still waiting for that all Asian cast American movie that will be the ""Black Panther"" for the Asian community. So far the only proper all Asian cast American movie is Crazy Rich Asian and that was a rom-com about rich people which isn't what I am looking for. The Disney live-action remake of Mulan (1998) is a proper big-budget all Asian cast movie that aligns with what I am looking for. However, Disney live-action remakes have been mostly a miss apart from ""The Jungle Book"" and ""Cinderella"". Mulan (2020) is directed by Niki Caro who won lots of awards for her movie Whale Rider(2002) but it does make me wonder if they couldn't have just hired an Asian director but whatever. The trailers though seem to suggest that this remake was actually attempting to do things differently from the original which intrigued my interest. Unfortunately, due to coronavirus, this movie got delayed and then shoved to streaming with a hefty price instead of going to cinemas. I actually avoided watching the original Mulan recently just to make myself go into this movie with a more open mind and to have a sort of first time watching experience again. Therefore, I am going to avoid comparison with the original in this review. So after watching this, did the movie live up to the expectations?
Note: unlike my previous reviews there is going to be a fair amount of minor spoilers here so be warned.Firstly, visually the movie is quite beautiful. There are some gorgeous shots in this movie such as the martial art practice by the lake, Mulan running on the rooftops and even the war itself was quite visually pleasing. The cinematography isn't ""Roger Deakins"" level of stunning but it is definitely really good looking. This is also elevated by the really good set design and costumes. The set design allows for great scenery and the costumes feel authentic. These really help pull the audience into the movie and the era that Mulan is set in.Secondly, the score by Harry Gregson-Williams who has done the score for movies like Shrek and The Martian does a pretty good job here as well with Mulan. They use a lot of wind instruments that are heard from a lot of Chinese movies and pretty much use them here. The score generally works and it really helps create the atmosphere for each scene really well. Also, the orchestral cover of Reflection from the original Mulan is used in this movie and is just really awesome,Now my gripes with this movie. Firstly, is the lack of emphasis on emotional moments. It feels like the movie brushes over a lot of what I would consider quite important. The scene where Mulan makes the decision to go to war is one of the important decision she makes. However, the movie just has her pick up a sword and then the next scene she is in armor and off to war. We don't get any emphasis on how important this decision was and the sacrifices she had to make until halfway through the movie for some reason. This happens a couple of times as well such as when there is a destroyed town which shows the horror of war but they only spend a couple of seconds here with minimal reaction from the characters and it's then just off to the next scene. Another being a character dying and it's just whatever. The movie feels really lacking in a lot of humanity but there are a couple of banter moments between Mulan and ""friends"" that have some fun in it.On that note of characters, the supporting characters are rather bland. Honghui (Yoson An) acts as a love interest, rival and ally for Mulan which is all there is about him. Commander Tung (Donnie Yen) sort of mentors Mulan and knew Mulan's dad but that's really it. The Emperor (Jet-li) is a badass and wise emperor who barely appears in the movie. Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) who is the main villain also barely appears in the movie despite being the bad guy who started the war. The Witch (Gong Li) who is probably the worst character in this entire movie is like Mulan but bad. These are all the relevant supporting characters but there are others who are so forgettable I don't remember if they even had names.The character arc which is part of the story is not great either. Mulan's decision to finally be true to herself and not hide that she is a woman just sort of happens because she got beaten up. Instead of it happening in a dramatic way it just feels rather random. Also, Mulan is special because she got lots of chi which ruins the message of the movie. Instead of feeling like she earned her place in the army and gaining the recognition of her comrades through her efforts it instead feels like she only got it because she is the chosen one. So the message is now ""be true to yourself only if you're the special one"". The Witch also goes through a character arc as well but it is extremely rushed and dumb. She makes choices that don't even make any sense such as divulging the main villain plans or sparing Mulan constantly or the really dumb choice at the end of the movie. Her addition to Mulan is pointless and if anything took away all the screentime from the main villain instead.The action scenes are also mediocre which is such a shame. Asian movies have always nail action scenes with their amazing choreography but in Mulan it is BORING. The trailers made it seem like it might be in the veins of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" withs it floaty yet elegant style of fighting. However, it instead really plain and overly edited with many cuts.On that note of edits, there are some weird edits in this movie that make it feel like there were important scenes that were cut. Minor spoilers but there is a scene where Mulan is riding a horse towards the enemies army in an open field but then the next scene suddenly has her behind the enemy hiding behind a rock with no explanation whatsoever. There is also a scene where after Mulan has decided to be true to herself in which she saves an ally but makes a choice to disappear into the fog. The next scene is then showing her dramatically coming back to her allies seconds later. It is so weird and took me out of the movie for sure.I also have to talk about our main lead actress Liu Yifei who plays Mulan. She sucks. She plays Mulan with no charm or charisma or even a personality. The tone in her voice is always the same and the only real change in her voice is when she is pretending to be a male with a deep voice. She also makes no expression whatsoever, it always feels like she has the same neutral expression in every moment even when someone died its the same expression. At least Donnie Yen and Jet Li are good in their roles though.Overall, the movie is not the all Asian cast American movie I am waiting for. It is just another inferior remake from Disney. It has none of the fun that was in the original so the movie just ends up being boring. There are some things you can enjoy in the movie with some pretty good moments sprinkled in there. Additionally, it is still pretty much a retelling of the original Mulan so the overall story is still there. It just isn't as good it could have been. Such a shame..."
936,"Awesome work, acting was on point and every scene is a piece of art
Disney did it again ladies and gentlemen"
937,Very bad acting and nonsense story... the original cartoon is totally ruined. Don't waste time to watch it and definitely not worth paying the ticket.
938,The original mulan had humour and that was definitely missing in this movie. The fact that Mushu was not in it was sooooooo disappointing. The whole movie was just disappointing
939,Do not waste your time on this garbage. Straight trash
940,"Apperently removing the musical aspect instead becoming a brave move, turn out to be a dumb idea. There's a lot of point on the movie that will work out so much better with a song, and no doubt build the character development to a decent level at least. But no, they remove almost everything we know about Mulan (the sidekick, the interaction and especially the music) and instead gave us the typical cheap editing drama, not the disney show we are all paying forAt least, gotta admit, the message are good. The Disney rare cases where the girl saving the guys moment are well build, some of the background are stunning, the choreography get my high praise, but all the good thing immediately drown with the flat, soulless Mulan characters, a lazy writings antagonist and laughable finaleOnce again, this heavy budget remake fall into the same mistake they done on the previous Aladdin live action, by making the ending feel EMPTY and RUSHED so the plot can go on. (The worst ending by Disney live action remake so far)
Personally i don't mind the pace become more then 2 hours long, just to added more layer to the character so that the story at least will make senseThe original Mulan story, regardless on lack of a magical aspect, still shine on her own way with the most down to earth princess figure. But the remake itself has wasted a lot of potential of explaining that, and instead giving us with a try-hard mature movie to a childhood expecting audience, without any reason why we must loved this but not the older version of the masterpiece Mulan's 1998 who are the main reason people pay their big cash forBut we gonna accept what we got, and i'm disappointing again"
941,"Stunning visuals in this movie, however the story lacked depth. I couldn't relate to it culturally could be why. Lots of really corny scenes that seem so weird. Very much Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I think it will do well in China. I think it was made for China."
942,"Thank you Disney for producing a movie that showcase the Chinese talents, martial arts, Chinese culture, and the beautiful scenery of China. It just fills my heart with glee and makes me proud to see this film. Excellent cast chosen for the roles, amazing fighting scenes, and most importantly, the values and lessons embedded in this film.Mulan is a story very close to my heart. Thank you for producing a film that is worthy of the legendary historical character."
943,"Illogical story with strange and awkward value and mindset.Beautiful scenes
Acting-wise is acceptable."
944,"This remake is good if you don't expect it to be the same as the animated one! This kind of Hua Mulan is more real. I don't mind the lack of singing, comedy, or romance. I liked the changes they made in Shang's character. Sorry but I really can't imagine a singing Mulan for this remake. This may not be the best but it is good enough. But I have to point out that the absence of 'I'll Make A Man Out Of You' had a huge impact."
945,"Can't fault this movie. It's brilliantly produced and fit for purpose... which means entertaining! Not a single ""dragging "" moment. A great watch for any child.... and adult. Can't honestly understand the criticism... it is a Disney children's film after all and an excellent adaptation."
946,"I dint review very often but I am annoyed by the bad reviews here giving it 1 Star for not being worth $30.The film is great, it could have used some a song or two but the film is very good and worth a viewing! Especially when you haven't seen a new epic film
Since at least Feb!!!!"
947,"For all those defending the movie as ""the target demographic won't care"", let me tell you this much: my seven year old nephew loves the original Mulan, asks to watch it all the time. This one, however, he wasn't able to hold out for 15 minutes.The scenery is amazing, the acting is adequate, story line is very slow, especially when compared to its original, which is why it fails for it's target demographic. In a world where the plot is being developed and moved on every minute, there is no time for scenes like ridding your horse through the grass."
948,"I don't know why people giving it a bad rating. It is an action movie. If you love action and martial arts, they don't think anything, just watch it."
949,"I've never been a fan of animated movies, but when given the option between the 1990's original animated film and this shoddy copy - I'll take the animation every time! How did they screw this up so badly? Filled with boring monologue and action scenes and with non sensical SJW rhetoric throughout, this was doomed from the written script. If you haven't seen the original you would completely miss how traumatic it was for Mulan to become a man as this movie provides no backstory for her emotions - when the animated characters generate more emotions than real actors you know there's an issue."
950,"Nothing new, just another lousy shaolin movie. Such a waste of time and money."
951,"I can't believe the bad reviews for this movie! My family and I watched this movie 3 times already! Too many people want to be ""faithful"" to the original animated movie. The story is great, the acting is pure and it tells the story in a new & refreshing way!"
952,My whole family enjoyed the whole experience very much. My kids love this movie. Mulan is very empowering!
953,"As an Asian American, I was brought up with old tales like Hua Mulan. This movie made my kinda furious. Let's not talk about the weird arcitectural style, wrongly cited makeup and costumes which made my sisiter who studied in Asian Studies laughed. The core value of the original story is gone. In the original story, Mulan is just a ordinary girl like everybody else who sews. No stupid Chi or chasing chicken on the rooftop. However, Mulan's grassroot characteristics are actually what make the story shine. It tells us that no matter which gender you identified with or what you are capable of, you get to do whatever you want if you make your mind to it. I didn't see any of it in the movie becasue they decided that ""okay girls can't defeat armies let give them superpowers so it can make sense"". What the hell Disney?????"
954,"Having the original Mulan an important part of my childhood, with the original Mulans (Ming-Na and Lea) being some of my favourite actresses, I ignored the #BoycottMulan movement and watched it anyway.I regret it immensely.It is just another generic Chinese martial arts film trying to imitate the success of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""Hero"", or ""Shadow"". It has the style, but it lacks the substance. The awe-inspiring Disney Magic is downgraded to actual magic. They removed Mushu for ""realism"" but added a shapeshifting witch. At least Mushu as a dragon is representative of Chinese culture. But a witch?The new Mulan is also a Mary Sue. There is no growth or struggle like the animated version. The characters have no depth, and the acting is... ""Chinese style"": exaggeration that even surpassed that of stage acting. Reading the original Chinese prose is more rewarding than watching this.I must go and ""reflect"" on my childhood, now ruined...
... Wait. Where's my reflection?"
955,"Obviously this movie is nowhere near as beautiful and entertaining as the original. It isn't terrible, but I wouldn't watch it again. The lack of music, lack of character development, and additions of characters did not help this movie in any way. The Emperor in this movie seemed so cold, but in the original he is kind. I genuinely enjoy Mulan and Li Shang's relationship, and that wasn't included in this movie.Would I recommend it? If you like Disney, sure. But it won't be one you'll fall in love with; especially not over the original."
956,"What can I say? Disney managed to get one more movie to grab as much cash as possible. I can't really point out enough how disappointed I am with this movie not because it was terrible but because it was terrible next to the original Mulan story. When I learned that this movie would take a different direction I was kinda excited hoping to see a different movie with the same main theme that will exceed my expectations and I was wrong. This movie excells in cinematography and fighting choreographies were pretty good, also some actors did their job good enough. But beyond that, this movie has nothing else, the plot is stupid and simplified, they didn't even try to make her look like a boy, the humour was terrible, and the dialogue felt wooden and written by a comitee to create a feminist symbol with the worst possible way. I am really sad to see that they oversimplified and ruined an amazing story like the original Mulan story, it's very disappointing, I hope they realize that nostalgia isn't enough to make a bad movie good and sooner or later people will dump Disney to the bottom that this kind of film making belongs."
957,"The movie is lacklustre, boring and meaningless. Several scenes don't make sense and are cringeworthy, making audience scratch their heads and still don't understand the reason behind the decision. For example, the almighty witch decides to help Mulan for after her unconvincing and ridiculous request after she has helped the bad buy go very far. The phoenix is annoying and helpless and looks like a kite. There is no reason why they should keep that animal. There is nearly no fight scenes, only a few that make you sleepy. Not funny, not interesting, much time-wasting.The actress is also being boycotted because she encouraged HongKong police to hurt it's own citizens. An actress living in America, benefiting from democracy but backing up China just afraid of losing her money.Such a pointless movie only hurts Disney itself and makes people disappointed."
958,"To me this was the best live adaptation yet!! I love the animated one and this had hits of that but also told its own version of the story. With some of the past live action movies, I have been disappointed because most of them have seemed to be the exact same as the animated. Yes I love the animated versions but I also want to see something new. And this did that! Yes it didn't have mushu or songs or any of that stuff. But I still think Disney did an amazing job with this version of Mulan!"
959,"The actors and actresses performed putting on a wooden face as if I owed them money. I still remember the hilariousness of the previous cartoon, which made my day with its humor and vitality , while this movie just depresses me and makes me nostalgic. Disney should focus on creating more interesting cartoons instead of wasting money on employing people to incarnate the cartoon characters."
960,I wasn't expecting much from this movie but it captured my attention quickly and I found myself in tears a few times. It may not be what Mulan fans would hope for but I found it to be a riveting well told story with a nice happy ending.
961,"Some people seem to be ""angry face"" about this beautiful movie. I admit that baffles me. This new film, while imperfect, is utterly engrossing, incredibly gorgeous and, at times, deeply moving. If you miss the original, why not watch the original? This is its own thing.It's based on the same legend, but is a unique interpretation of that source material -- influenced by the animated film but not chained to it. It also climaxes in one of the greatest finales of any film ever produced."
962,"I want to start by saying that I did not compare this movie with the original Cartoon as I last saw it many moons ago, so my review is based on this movie alone. I must say that I really enjoyed it and my only regret is that I had to watch it at home due to COVID 19 restrictions, I would of rather had a popcorn and coke in my lap and gone to a local cinema with my wife or a friend to enjoy this masterpiece. Story was excellent, acting was very impressive and the action scenes were superb. I understand those who compared it to the original cartoon and were disappointed, I have done that with other movies ( Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory for example) but I give this action flick 8 stars, thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely watch it again. The casting for this movie was on point, do yourself a favour and enjoy watching MULAN without comparing it to the cartoon movie"
963,"Don't listen to what most of these reviews are saying, great movie..."
964,"Having never seen the original animated film I had nothing to compare this movie to, and I'm glad I didn't. I thought film was well done with good action and it was very beautiful to look at. I'm glad Disney didnt do a remake like The Lion King of Aladdin...which I personally think were crap. This one was probably my favourite of the remakes. It's okay to disagree...but my family enjoyed it."
965,"First i m really bored by the guys who claimed that this movie  and put 1/10 . I ve seen aladdin and the jungle book movies and ok they were not very good , really under the original animated. But for me not this time . i ve really enjoyed this movie and i ve found it far better than the original one.
So dont read the bad comments and take a look yourselves ."
966,"Garbage movie , one of the worst cartoon adoption ever"
967,"The fairest thing when judging this movie would be to split the review in two: Mulan as a stand-alone movie and Mulan as a remake.As a a stand-alone movie, Mulan is a very mixed bag. It has beautiful landscapes, a great soundtrack and introduced new, original ideas that sadly weren't executed in the best way. The movie has pacing problems, and a lot of scene supposed to be climactic came up as dull. The biggest fail of this movie, however, is the complete lack of characterization of its protagonists and the messy dialogue, with a lot of grandiloquent sentences but very little substance. There's almost no chemistry between characters, little character growth and the emotions are almost non existent.As a remake, however, Mulan isn't a good one. While it does follow the events of the animated movie in a close way, the movie failed to capture its spirit and complexity, especially when it comes to Mulan, which feels like a watered-down, Mary Sueish version of the animated character. I just wish directors and screenwriters realized that a strong female character is far more than ""a badass woman with no flaws that can fight"".It still remains an entertaining movie, hence the 5. Not worth the $30 though."
968,"If you're looking for the fun Mulan we all know and love, you definitely won't find it here."
969,Besides the film having few references to the original film and a rough beginning it turns around in the end. I would say it is still worth watching. Giving it a harsh review for not being identical to the original is silly. The Ballad of Mulan remains the same despite the lack of suicide on Mulan's part. Just watch the movie. It's decent.
970,This is not like the original animated movie... and I am so glad Disney didn't go that route. They allowed it to be made in a more traditional sense. It's a fantasy martial arts movie. It's the kind of movie you would expect from their culture. It was a good movie.
971,"There are a lot of trolls reviewing this movie. Seems like they are sore that this is about a female.
Mulan has stunning visuals, fight choreography, inspiring story and a bit of magic too. There are complaints that it's not like the animated version - of course it's not. They took the heart of the story and made a live action version. Glad they used an all Asian cast and didn't white wash. Would watch again, wish it was longer."
972,"You can tell if a movie is going to be a well-produced one by its first 10 mins or in some cases, merely 5 mins. This Mulan movie at the beginning shows off the young Mulan jumps effortlessly onto a high roof to chase a rebel chicken. She slips off the loose roof tiles but flips upright with ease as she plunged to the ground. Nothing wrong in setting up the story in this manner but it's the way they made her Kung Fu-ed her fall in an obvious stilted style exactly like a puppet on strings.We know Kung Fu heroes or heroines can't leap effortlessly onto a 20 feet high roof and command impossible gravity defying feats by mere light footholds. While the film makers can remove the strings and harness digitally, but they don't have to have the actors moved like they are on strings. This is the same as with Michelle Yeoh's The Touch (citing one example of similar genre) her stunts there are painfully difficult to watch and appreciate. Yeoh just as Disney's Mulan's YiFei Liu can proved to be A-class actors in the hands of a better director and stunt choreographer.The choice of Mulan's father played by the indefatigable and veteran Chinese actor, Tzi Ma, could be more convincing given another Chinese actor.Also, film makers could have avoided the temptation to employ generous use of CGI just because they could afford it.It's a shame that Disney with all its years of film making experiences and what-money-could-buy resources could have done a better live action film with an inspiring story like Mulan. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Hero, Terra Cotta Warrior, Ip Man series fared better with their flying stunts."
973,"As a remake of a classic animation, the live-action mulan is eligible for both a teen-oriented audience and a teen-oriented audience. The color of the film is bright, which may be due to the age of the audience. In terms of plot, it is similar to the mulan story we usually know. The core difference between the film and animation is the psychological change process of the protagonist, from passive to active, from being discovered to being a woman, to honestly facing his identity as a woman. In keeping with the trend of The Times, from who I am to who I am, it's not bad. Of course, if you start with an adult perspective on a movie, it can be a bit disappointing."
974,"Yes there were a lot of changes compared to the cartoon Mulan movie we grew up watching, however, it was still AMAZING and still such a powerful storyline. This movie showed power, braveness, loyalty and so much more. I felt all the emotions! The cast, writers and producers did an phenomenal job. They should be very proud!!!!"
975,"Just finished watching the remake of Mulan. And shall I say, it was SO worth the wait! I loved every minute of it and I teared up a few times watching it, especially close to the ending tears were coming down. I shall say, I found it a LOT better than the original. Even though there were no songs and no Mushu, the fighting and everything else happening around it made that not matter to me. I was also glad they changed a lot in this movie compared to the original. It made the movie more interesting to me.
I will rate the remake of Mulan probably a 9 out of 10. I loved it that much and I don't think there was anything I did not like about the movie."
976,"As many here whine about it not being a direct copy of Mulan the animation, it was definitely an enjoyable movie.It's a lot more ""serious"" and focuses on big epic stuff, not so many jokes etc but again - I feel it fit the movie."
977,"It's really easy to compare the old with the new, but why do we need a remake of a film we already have. The original is great and a classic, this is a new direction and I really like it."
978,"The first Mulan movie was really nice. But im fed up of all the remakes Disney is doing who are just copy of the animated version.
As a kid, i was always bored of disney versions of classic stories, changing everything (like Pocahontas real story and disney's version).
Here, you have finaly something more realistic and more close to the original story, with amazing actors and very few special effect. Its real, amazing, and the fights, oh my god, are AMAZING !!!"
979,They kept the cinematic views you'd typically find in kung-fu movies which was great. Story line was also much better than the cartoon. The whole family loved it. A bit expensive though
980,"This is Disney at its finest! Beautiful costumes, great acting and inspiring story. This film is so well done from the shots to the set design to the special effects. I loved every bit of it."
981,"I reviews while watching the movie, I came in to check about ""the chi"" described in the movie and saw how low was the rating for the movie and the fact that so many reviewers are surprise/outrage/inflamed about the fact the movie is completely different from the cartoon; when I found out this Mulan wasn't a comedy like the cartoon, I just went ""Oh, ok, let's see"".
The basic story is the same but no Mushu and all the gags, I adored Mulan, like all the Disney cartoon, but I am very aware Disney made many different kinds of movie, even in the past! With just humans, just cartoons, humans and cartoons, Humans with cartoons and real animals, humans and animals with no cartoon, funny and serious, so, I don't see what the fuss is about.
Even though I've not finished to watch it yet, I think I am pretty sure I know how it'll develop, think of The Wall with Mat Damon, with some of the fighting of ""Crouching tiger and hidden dragon"" if you have not seen either then it is a decent effort by Disney production, and the story of Mulan, the kick ass girl warrior who impersonated a man to help her father is already a winner, don't expect to much and enjoy"
982,"First of all, I love the original Mulan. I have wonderful memories seeing it in the theater as a child and upon rewatching it recently, had my positive opinion of it reinforced. With that being said, I don't think it's a good idea to compare the new Mulan to the original, just because they are different styles of movies (animated vs live action) and they are both great in different ways.I thought the actress who played Mulan did a wonderful job and brought a lot of charisma to the role. The entire cast did well and I enjoyed many of their performances. The soundtrack was also very nice and included a few themes from the animated movie which I loved. The story was moving and I appreciated many of the decisions of the writers and production team. Overall, I would recommend this movie and implore you to give it a chance and appreciate it for what it is."
983,"Though there will invariably be those who complain that this isn't a shot-by-shot remake of the 90's version, I absolutely loved Disney's live action Mulan! Having been to Western China and New Zealand where the stunning landscapes were filmed, I'm admittedly disappointed that I didn't get to see Niki Caro's vision on IMAX (first world problem of the month). Unlike in the animated classic, every role in this version is played by an actor of Asian with Yifei Liu being cast perfectly in the role of Mulan (it would have been awesome if Ming-Na Wen would have been cast as Mulan's mother). Mandy Walker's cinematography during the fight sequences utilizes a few Crouching Tiger, Flying Princess (yes, I did say PRINCESS haters...so don't at me) elements in the use of red in the costuming is stunning. The score ties the film back to the original with Christina Aguilera returns two decades later to update ""Reflections"" as well as belting out ""Loyal, Brave & True"" (I will be shocked if the latter isn't nominated for an Oscar). While it did feel like it lagged in a few scenes, the message it sent is still resoundingly class. Just like its animated predecessor, Mulan provides yet another example of a strong female Disney character for young girls to show them that they don't need to sit around waiting to be rescued by a prince...indeed, it shows that while women are too easily dismissed as weak...when given the opportunity, they can rise to be strong leaders for others to follow and save a nation...a message that children and adults should hear. Those whining about not being animated classic are idiots...the real original story goes back more than 1500 years and didn't involve a magical dragon...and yet, no one whined en masse about Disney ruining the Chinese ballad. Regardless, there's room in my Mulan loving heart for both versions of this movie!"
984,This modern version of mulan might even be better than the original since its way more accurate to the true legendary story about mulan.
985,"I think Disney has done an amazing job with this movie. The storyline pays tribute to the true Chinese legend and have done a fantastic job. The cast was well-selected and I believe Mulan was a revolutionary movie and was a breath of fresh air. Growing up with Disney, I was worried it would be nothing like the cartoon, but I was wrong to be worried. Whilst the movie isn't the same, it still has aspects that reminds you of the cartoon. It is not a childish animation, but a true work of art that can allows people to appreciate the legend. Disney has outdone itself once again, and anyone who says otherwise has no idea what they are talking about and are holding onto the past."
986,"We watched Mulan on Disney plus. Visually the film is fantastic and the acting is all fine. There is a small issue with character development, which the animation version did well. The film felt a bit rushed, however, still worth a watch."
987,"First of all, don't understand why people are throwing such a fit over this movie.
I expected some lower reviews simply just for the actress who played Mulan (who was brilliant by the way), but I've come across more reviews that just show people's arrogance peeping through, bashing the movie because it's 'not how they remember it' or 'want it to be'.
Remember, this story is a Chinese story and the movie follows Chinese themes and traditions like upholding family honour. The movie keeps it's empowering story, whilst being more serious than the animated version, it keeps the heart of the original; not to mention the beautiful cinematography.Most of these reviews are blabbering on about characters like Mushu the dragon, or the missing musical numbers. If you want to watch something exactly like the Mulan cartoon, then go and watch that.Overall the movie is a lot better than it's being credited for."
988,"This was a great take on the ballad of mulan. It was not just some tacky remake like lion King. It was beautiful to see, though would have been way better in theaters. It had heart and soul. I'm similar to other people, in that I hate when they try to remake good movies. But I love the original cartoon version and I love this version equally."
989,"I encourage you to watch this film and to not be swayed by the swarm of whiny man-babies rating it so low and complaining about their ongoing childhoods in this section. Do not expect upon beginning it to see the exact same as the 1998 original. This is a more mature story and a closer insight on rigid societal systems and how they are historically unfair to certain categories. Despite what the 'member-days nostalgists spew, it is better, as it is closer to a real-life legend. While incorporating unrealistic elements, they can be tolerated, as all good stories change their form and style, while remaining true to their core message. Let us not forget that the original Mulan story was NOT written in 1998, but is so old and has become so archetypal that we still cannot pin its exact origins. To me, the 1998 film was both fun and a slap in the face of the real legend. They went the right way in the live-action remake, removing all of the childish jokes (including Mushu and his stand-up routine) and focusing on the legend and its message. It does right by the original story. Not a verbatim retelling of the 1998 story, for kids who forgot to grow up, but an outstanding example for all of us. As all great legends are.I do not give this film a full rating because of the untimely and improper release. It should have been further postponed, as it was already overdue. The format in which it is made available does it little justice, and the theatrical release would have also been impossible given our current worldwide situation. This compromise solution also somewhat compromises the experience of the film.Thank you for taking the time to read."
990,"Never seen any of the previous versions of Mulan, but I'm presuming they weren't this boring? Not only was I bored, quite often the story was just stupid. I suppose this is aimed at kids, but a good kids movie should interest everyone."
991,"Had high expectations, but ended up feeling so embarrassed watching this. The story was very badly unfolded. Characters are weakly and oddly portrayed. Let alone failing to show the real beauty of the ancient oriental world. This film is a joke!"
992,"I always love Mulan, but I know they make so many mistakes about the cultural references that make me sad when I remember. This is a REAL Mulan movie and has everything you want and more about the cultural background, very good story, solid characters, beautiful landscape and way more.PS: If you want to see this thinking in the Mulan of the silly jokes and fragile girl, please don't. Change the mindset first, is a must."
993,"I am a big fan of all things Mulan so I spent the money to watch the stream.Unfortunately it was a huge disappointment.Inspite of some high quality actors it had the flair and vibe of a C rate movie.Actually I am sure many teenage High school productions can come up with a better script, interesting dialogue and characters with depth.Expensive production with a near religious looking kitsch cinematography I am sure it ticked all the boxes of some communist 5 year plan, but it is totally undeserving for a global and very demanding audience.Sad, really sad.So don't waste your money I am sure you can soon stream it for free."
994,I was a little concerned there was going to be too much CGI use in the first few scenes but really enjoyed the whole product. Great action and acting. Superb scenery.
995,"Heart-warming story, beautiful visuals, nice and sympathetic actors/characters. Charming, subtle moments followed by incredible choreography and action. Felt very respectul and appropriate to the region, culture and history.
This is not just a live-action remake, this is a MOVIE. Loyal, Brave & True. 8/10"
996,"First good remake. Great camera and costume work, very enjoyable. Highly recommend.The 1 and 2 srar reviews need to get out more. If your childhoods have been ruined, then couldnt of been much to note to start with."
997,"I hate when people compare to the original
As a story it's very different from what I've read of other reviews.
but for a moment take a note and pretend it's a standalone movie.
If they had called it Wuhan, and it been a story based on the same thing, everyone would have loved it, only because it's a REMAKE not a clone, people are getting all up themselves.
Seriously don't think about the previous movie, overall I think Disney did a great job on this title."
998,"This is a familiar story, a different way of expression. The performance of the actors is also very satisfied. Disney will always surprise you. Although not always, this does not prevent you from going to a Disney movie. You can always find touching scenes or fragments in the movie. Although this movie does not have the classic characters of cartoons, it does not prevent it from being a moving movie and a qualified Disney commercial film. And it's worth watching twice."
999,"The movie brought a new version about the Legend and the animation. Of course I missed mushu and the songs but the story was fascinating and had amazing action scenes. The movie actually surprised me. I wasn't expecting to feel goosebumps in the movie but I felt it anyway. I must say this is my opinion and I think the movie was amazing. If it was to be exactly alike the animation, I would have preferred to watch the animation. So I think the movie brought a original and different version that made the movie be that great. Of course I missed so many things that had in the animation but when I was watching it, I forgot about it and enjoined. It is not just a movie about a woman that decides to be a warrior, is much more. That's my opinion."
1000,"I was looking forward to watching the sweet story of Mulan saving China and within the bigger plot watching three soldiers fall in love with three princesses. I was looking forward to the witty jokes from the sassy dragon and singing along to the beautifully classic songs but none of which happened. Characters were added to the storyline that weren't in the original, so many events didn't make it into the remake and I'm quite disappointed. Definitely not worth the $35 on Disney + and probably won't watch it again."
1001,"W-O-W. Visually it was a gorgeous movie, filled with color. A LOT of beautiful callbacks to the 1998 movie, like a LOT. I loved seeing a few of my favorite Asian actors doing what they do best and also paving the way for other young asian actors to shine. I mean, come on. Jet Li, Tzi Ma, and Donnie Yen? They're legends.HOWEVER, if you're going in with the expectation that it will be like the original, it's not the same by far. It is its own story. No, there's no Mushu, but that didn't matter, honestly. As for the music... well, let's just say that the score is one of the best that I've heard in a LONG time."
1002,"I'm Asian so I would like to think I am the target audience of this movie. My biggest problem is that the movie has clearly been managed to death. The script has no heart at all. And Liu Yifei, as pretty as she is, being the blandest of bland actresses, brings no emotional depth to the role."
1003,"I found the movie did its best to establish a decent story at the beginning but as the movie went on it just went off the rails, the decision to cut up action sequences and employ random camera moves took me out the movie quite often. storywise it made a decent effort but a lot of plotlines just were left hanging or ended abruptly without much explanation afterwards. The main issue i had was how a live action movie could possibly be less realistic than the cartoon, the original is a movie set in reality with a bit of mythical stuff but this one was just off its head and i think it tried to do too much to distance itself from the original it lost its way. Also the witches death? that was just anticlimactic and did disjustice to her character."
1004,"Just about exactly 18 years ago I watched the Disney animated ""Mulan"" and wrote, ""...young girl Mulan disguises herself as a young man and reports to fight the Huns instead of her ailing father, and becomes a hero. I felt some of the silly characters, and the ""spirits"", were making fun of the Chinese. And, while Eddie Murphy's character, the midget dragon, was funny, it was too much like the talking donkey in ""Shrek.""This version is with real people and much more serious in tone. My wife and I enjoyed it, we found it entertaining and the actress who plays Mulan (and also sings the closing song) is very good in her role.The IMDb rating at this point appears artificially low, due to the approximate 18% of ""1"" votes, which is impossible to justify. While it won't go down as a great movie of our times it is certainly NOT a ""1"" movie. More like a ""6"" or ""7"" movie.My wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library. Unfortunately no ""making of"" extras on the disc."
1005,"Unlike the live version of the Beauty and the Beast (2017) in contrast to its animated original (1991), Mulan's transformation into a live version of its original animation (1998), Disney has managed to create just as vibrant and compelling Asian story of honor, courage, truth, and devotion to family to the big screen. This epic action adventure sprawls across the lavish landscape of China. The luscious elements of the adolescent, comedic version of Asian in Golden Child (1985) or the martial art fantasy feminine features of Elektra (2005) are on full display here big time. Even though the cultural controversy with the Chinese crackdown in Hong Kong may diminish this movie's attraction, the deeper message of duty to Country and family remain intact.In some ways, though, Mulan doesn't quite have the emotional detailed intimacy of the likes of the Chinese martial arts movie The Grandmaster (2013) nor the captivating, unique beauty of the cultural sci fi challenges of The Giver (2014), nor the epic Chinese military intensity of The Great Wall (2017), or the even more difficult cultural obstacles found in the sci fi The Host (2013). Mulan can't quite rise to the level of the all encompassing and compelling vastness and internal familial conflicts depicted in the fantasy epic The Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe (2005) or the wonderous magnificence of amazing spectacle of Alexander (2004) or the sweeping nature of the award-winning classic Lawrence of Arabia (1962). Nevertheless, the richness and vital power of Mulan is well worth seeing."
1006,"I guess the reason I liked this movie is I never saw the original. Just a great movie, great story, wonderful photography, fantastic music and I have always been amazed at this era of Chinese history."
1007,"Just about exactly 18 years ago I watched the Disney animated ""Mulan"" and wrote, ""...young girl Mulan disguises herself as a young man and reports to fight the Huns instead of her ailing father, and becomes a hero.

1008,"I was really excited to see this film. But what I saw was a total disgrace. It all starts with mulan joining the army as a man and the only thing they did was wrapping her hair. Apart from that NOTHING! I mean seriously? it's clearly not respecting the fans
And also the fight scenes are so unrealistic and the CGI are also not good. Everything is just so random!"
1009,"I was hesitant to go watch the movie because of the very low rating (5.4), but I decided to ignore it...and thank God I did! I loved every bit of it...although it doesn't have the exact same scenario that the original movie did, but still I loved it...and then I realized that there was a boycott campaign against the star actress due to her opinion regarding police in Hong Kong...but why should that affect the movie? It's really unfair!"
1010,"The film was not like the one we know, but it was beautiful and full of enthusiasm
with a few mistakes."
1011,Don't listen to the negative reviews. Everyone is upset bc its not like the original. Think of it as a brand new thing and you'll be great. Its a fantastic movie. Extremely well done and enjoyable to watch.
1012,"So I just watched the new Mulan movie, and I gotta say it's surprisingly decent. It's not the best I would not recommend watching it if your looking for an action packed, funny story , filled with happy characters. If you wanna watch a disney life action remake you shouldn't watch this.
Now on to the bad stuff about this movie.
So I'm kinda mad that mushu wasn't in the movie, because first of all they tried to make it « more realistic, » Yeah, you made it more realistic by adding in a flying bird witch thing, and also added Mulan having this cook super power with the hole Chi thing...
Like Disney, come on. If your gonna make it realistic don't add Magic Witches, Moving carpets, wall running (no joke they ran on the walls, not like running sideways, they ran on the walls,) And of course the stupid arrow catching. So yeah Mulan isn't that good, but there are good things with it. I say four out of ten, wouldn't watch again."
1013,Despite what others say. I thought it wasa great movie with a new take on the story. I liked that they tried to make it closer to the source matetial.
1014,"If I didn't see the animated version of Mula , I would not know what was going on. Seemed like a few characters didn't need to be in the show. On top of all that, no one really ever witnessed Mulan being a hero, so it seemed like she was just consistently apologizing for stuff no one knew she did. This movie did not bring honor to us all."
1015,"As a Chinese, I would say it might be one of the best movies that I have ever seen that a western director interpreted as well as possible about a Chinese story and Chinese culture, although there are still some awkward parts but I really appreciate the efforts. Actors, CG effects and costumes are cool and shows respect to history and culture.
However, I am really not into this story. And I think the worst part of this movie is that it twisted the spirits of Mu Lan and misunderstood the meaning of ""Loyal, Love..."". If you have studied the original poem of Mu Lan, you will understand better about the legendary story. In this movie, Mu Lan is more like a typical Disney Princess with gifted talent. But in the original poem, Mu Lan is an ordinary girl like us that followed by her heart, pursued her nature and made her own choice with courage and efforts. That is why her story has become a legend through 1700 years. She has been struggled, has been fighting with prejudice and difficulties, but she made efforts, grew up and become stronger. The nature and spirit of Mulan is about how a person finds and pursues her/his inner needs and ture-self and defeat prejudice and inner fears. Mu Lan goes to fight in the war because she loves her family and she wants to protect her people not because of some ridiculous ""Loyal, truth..."" This is not a Qing Dynasty guide book for woman! Mulan rejected the king's promotion because she wants a simple and natural life, not because she felt sorry to her father or ""Loyal..."". What Mu Lan did is all because of her own choices and nature of her. It has nothing to do with the tenets. I got part of this movie is trying to tell girls that any girl can be a hero. However it doesn't leave me this impression, instead I feel awkward and offended. Because the tenets ""Loyal..."" repeated too much in the movie, and they sound like the tenets which teach women about what good women you have to be in the feudalistic time in ancient China.
That's why I have to say that this movie is more like a third-rate fantasy martial-arts movie. It doesn't touched my heart at all."
1016,"Why all people rated 1 from 10 !!
Its a good movie. All actors were good."
1017,"I thought this movie was pretty good. It's nothing like the animated story except for the broad description and some vague references scattered throughout. My husband is from China and said it felt like a Chinese movie but with the characters speaking in English. He went into it accepting that it was going to see something more Western than he would've seen from a Chinese production and I went into it knowing it wasn't going to be as ""Disney-fied."" When you come at it from that perspective instead of expecting an exact retelling of the animated version (which is so historically and culturally inaccurate it's funny in and of itself) it is very interesting and enjoyable."
1018,"Messy culture representation, I saw people from different dynasties on the same street talking with each other. Soulless, I did not feel any emotion changes in the main characters in this movie. And it doesn't make any sense that why the witch(I don't see any name during the movie) saved Mulan's life, there are tons of ways to save Mulan but self-sacrifice. The funniest character Mushu disappeared, which makes the movie more tedious and bored."
1019,"Im sad... when i watched the 1998 movie i felt empowered, a NORMAL girl through effort and hard work becomes a great warrior, better than her male companions... NOT from magic, in the new movie she was born special and i couldnt relate to that, in the old movie SHE made her self special and strong.
The jokes at the start and the fact that she had this weird chi that made her a samurai when she was a child... it just made me feel uncomfortable. The colors and beautiful images was the only thing i liked..."
1020,"This movie has nothing to do with feminism or equality. It's suppose to be about Mulan taking her father's place in a war in order to protect him. She's suppose to be normal, not all powerful. Where was mushu? Why is there a witch? Why was this movie made?"
1021,"A wonderful movie😍 , I'm waiting for Mulan 2
Hope you will do it soon 😊"
1022,So sick movie in the world...dont waste yor time. orginial version is the best. just NO No No
1023,"I wish I didn't watch this terrible movie
This movie completely ruined the original 1998 version. Sketchy script, bad acting, the movie deserves more than 1 nomination at next year's Golden Raspberry Awards."
1024,This is second movies from Disney i'm getting sleepy after watching first 15 minutes. The first one is A Wrinkle in Time. >_<Sorry if i make a mistake. My english is not very good.
1025,"When you think Disney is capable of producing something even better than they did in the past.
Then suddenly this comes out. Who directed this for it to turn out this badly. What kind of main lead actress is that.
Gosh it just turned out so badly.
Different director and main lead and it could havr been the best movie 2020. But they just had to use the theme of 2020 and turn terrible."
1026,"The spirit of ""loyalty, brue and true"" is always conveyed in the film.Mulan had the ability since childhood, but as a woman, she had to hide to be a gentle and virtuous woman in the environment at that time, and was proud to marry a good family. But it was the opportunity of conscription that changed Mulan's life path.In the battle, she met xianniang who had the same ability but was regarded as a witch because of her female identity. Xianniang tried to kill Mulan at first, and then tried to persuade Mulan to join her. However, Mulan always knew her responsibility: to protect her homeland and protect her monarch. Only when she truly understood and released her heart could she become a powerful person, even if she was punished by military discipline . In the movie, Mulan takes off his male military uniform and spreads his hair on the galloping steed with the background music reflection, which is very exciting. As a woman, she can also lead the army to rescue the monarch. In a patriarchal society, she has won respect and found her own place in the patriarchal society."
1027,"Good points:
The acting/actors were talented.
The fight scenes were done nicely.
Overall graphics and appearance of the movie were good.Bad points:
-The movie plot seemed to fall between trying to be more of a serious film rather than a remake of a children's movie. This left me feeling like Disney didn't cater to the right target audience.
The movie was missing some the songs and characters that made the original movie so memorable for fans.This movie explores sexuality in ways that could be confusing to younger viewers. Mulan seems to have an attraction to one of the guys in the camp, but she is dressed as a man. They have a strange exchange in one of the camp scenes. These types of innuendos were not out rightly explored in the original movie. Also at the end that same guy says to Mulan once he finds out she is a woman at the end ""so you still won't hold my hand"". Then there is another character, depicted first as a man but then she morphs into a woman and a bird. In one of the initial scenes the woman is seen overthrowing a blanket with rainbow colored dyes.The Chinese culture and the dishonor themes may been seen as offensive to Chinese people because they seemed to be overly exaggerated and sometimes and wasn't depicted well. For example when Mulan was dressed in her traditional makeup for the match maker, her makeup was terrible (which I'm sure it was supposed to be) but if you were to see a true depiction of this formal Chinese attire I think it's really a beautiful way of dress and makeup. The way they made Mulan look was dishonoring of the culture. They literally just threw paint on her face it was so ugly."
1028,"It is so great how they killed the original Mulan with this movie. From now on, everytime Mulan is mentioned, this remake version will be mentioned and stayed in people's mind. The orignal Mulan was a lovable character. She was inspirational in some ways as she managed to obtain a lot of things through her determination and her intelligence. She showed the ""family spirit"" when she selflessly joined the Army instead of her old father. She was a figure who both young boys and girls can be related to. Now look at the new Mulan, what we have is an another Chosen One. You are born special, so you will not need to train or even try? What the heck? Is it really a good mentality to show in a movie? Go away from this movie if you seriously still try to hold onto the positive message in the original Mulan."
1029,"I really feel sorry for those who gave negative ratings to this movie. I really enjoyed this movie , and I want part 2. I am speechless I don't have words that can describe this movie."
1030,"A bit surprised to see such low ratings, why so many haters? This is a different take to the original humorous Disney animated version. However the tone and style of this movie is more true to the Chinese folk story. Yes, they added martial arts and some magic, but the original story was very simple, it needs to be spiced up a bit, I liked those touches. The witch character was not well developed and her ending was not convincing, felt very forced and rushed. Some parts were slow, but I thought it was enjoyable overall, probably best of Liu's performance. Nice to see a full Chinese cast."
1031,"I don't normally review films but the amount of negative comments seems disproportionate and needs to be balanced. Enjoyed the acting, Cast was great even if Jet Li and Donnie Yen are knocking on a bit. Scenery as you would expect is magnificent and the storyline acceptable.The script needed a bit more as there were holes in the back stories that detracted from the characters but only enough that you were left wanting more. Fight sequences were magnificent and the addition of the Phoenix was inspired.The middle bit of the story also needed a bit more as rthe transition to Hero felt rushed and under done.Thoroughly entertaining film with (as most films) some minor flaws, certainly not the train wreck some would have you believe!"
1032,"Corny Phoenix scenes, martial arts are pretty good but culturally wrong. The outfits in the village do not look Han at all. Get your facts right, production fail."
1033,"Before watching this movie, you must approach it as it's own version of a Chinese Legendary tale of Mulan and not the animated classic. Watch this movie with new eyes and you will find it to be quite entertaining. It has it's own take and is told via a much different style. I was looking forward to watching this when I first heard about it was keen to look at early reviews and noticed a pattern. People who hated it tended to keep comparing it to the animated version. The ones that liked it, tended to enjoy it for it's own merits. This allowed me to condition myself to forget that it is Disney telling the story and just watch. Honestly, it made a big difference. I like this best of all the live remakes Disney has done and it's the first one I went in not comparing. Plus it tells it with several different aspects from that of the animated version. The basic premise of the Chinese tale is in both versions but just told and expressed differently. I applaud this version and thought it to be well done. I purposely wrote this in such a way as to not spoil anything."
1034,"The acting in here constantly drew me out of the movie and was laughable on multiple occasions. Main actress was passable but the movie felt more ""ip man"" than disney...."
1035,"Where is my Mulan? Give me back my expectations. Waiting so long for nothing. Complete disappointment . Even the storyline has changed and so, there are no favorite characters appearing on screen."
1036,"Disney, where is the Disney Magic in this?!?!?! Who dropped the ball on this?! No Mushu. No songs. And No Mulan. Mulan is missing from Mulan here! You gave us a Chinese battle movie, with a beautiful Actress. You gave her magical powers and added a shapeshifting witch that honestly serves no purpose other than turning into a bird at the right time (if you know you know). Instead of making Mulan work hard and persevere through like the beloved Mulan 1998 version did, you gave the girl magical powers and DIDNT EVEN GIVE US MUSHU?!?!?! Face palm. I'm literally watching the animated version right now just to cleanse the garbage of the 2020 version you gave us! NOT WORTH THE $30! Wait til it comes out on Redbox."
1037,"I won't compare this to the original 1998 Disney Mulan since the people involved made it clear early on that they were going for something different. So I judged this film on its quality as a stand-alone film.
This movie is just bad in every way. From a juvenile script, jarring edits, unaesthetic wire work, and obvious plot holes that would bore even a young child. It's was dull, unimpactful, and clear that they had minimal direction. 20 minutes into the film and I was already looking at the clock.
Now, a good film doesn't have to wow with incredible effects and skill, quite the opposite. It's been proven many times that even a lackluster looking film or even bad effects can be overlooked if there is a good story. This film didn't even have that.
Another issue I had with it is it seems that the film makers pawned off other Chinese Mulan live action adaptions. Not just because the story is the same, but all the way from set design, character design, and even shot angles were the same (eg. 2009 Mulan film by Jingle Ma - watch it btw, it's better in every way).
Overall, this movie has nothing special. It's completely bland in every way. And that's not even the most frustrating part - the most obscene is that they are actually promoting this as something great, something inspiring, when it doesn't even try. Just like Mulan herself in this film - doing virtually nothing to earn respect but still expecting our praise."
1038,Terrible in every way.. And the Phoenix..?! Just cringe
1039,I think people are being a bit dramatic about this one. I think it's the best live action remake Disney has done so far. I loved the nods to the music in the background instead of making it a musical.
1040,"Spoiler Free ReviewI'm a disney fanatic and I wanted to love this movie. The truth is, I really, really didn't enjoy it.This movie was supposed to be groundbreaking with the all asian cast, yet production decided to use a white director and white writers (most of who have barely anything under their belts as it is) and it really shows.The film feels like it's trying to be something it's not. It's got all the action that you'd find in a traditional wuxia film (without any historical accuracy), except it's like they forgot to add the actual story in. There were no meaningful connections made throughout the entirety of the film, so I didn't end up really caring about anyone Mulan came into contact with or even Mulan herself. At the end of the movie, I was puzzling with myself like ""Wtf did I just watch for 2 hours?""Save yourself $30 and watch any of the following for a better experience: Hero, House of Flying Daggers, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The Forbidden Kingdom. Anything but Mulan.Disney, for your remakes of box office hits, please, for the love of Chi, invest in some more experienced directors and writers."
1041,"The movie is enjoyable if you don't expect it to be like the original. I don't know why, but they didn't even add the songs as a background song, not even the Cristina Aguilera one.The antagonist's eagle is now a shapeshifter, I liked the character, they did the same with Maleficient's raven. Now, not only they removed the dragon but they replaced it with a phoenix that looks like a kite and they talked about resurrection, when the chinese phoenix (Fenghuang) doesn't do such thing. They wanted to add chinese mythology and they did it wrong.And instead of making Mulan a normal woman who proves that she is as capable as the men after some training, she is OP since she is a little girl because she is blessed with a strong Chi. She can dodge arrows, throw them with a kick, perform acrobatic tricks. The other movie was about equality, wits, love and perseverance, this one is about the chosen one."
1042,"A new generation of viewers will identify with this movie. It's not your mom and dad's ""Mulan."" So don't go into th movie expecting that A lot of reviews are upset that their childhood is ruined by this version. It's a different movie, and it should be reviewed as such. Disregard the ratings and reviews about people complaining about how the movie isn't like the cartoon and give the movie itself a view. The cinematography and effects are besutiful; the action is intense, and the message is there. Sadly very few people get that. The movie becomes a target for people who want to complain. Find the right in this movie. Of course it's violent and mystical. It's about a warrior. While I didn't think it was worth the $34 price tag to stream, it definitely excelled in the remake category. If your childhood enjoyed the cartoon version, then watch that instead. This version definite captivates new viewers who are unfamiliar with the story. Give it a shot, and watch new viewers enjoy the legend of Mulan."
1043,"""A young woman disguises as a soldier to prevent her father's death"". That is what it shares with the animated movie. The dragon is replaced by a phoenix, now the problem is that despite phoenix existing in chinese mythology (Fenghuang), they don't represent resurrection, they are immortal, they writers didn't even use google. Then we have Shan Yu's eagle, they did the same they did in Maleficient with the raven, turned her into a woman (a shapeshifter witch). I liked the character, I don't know if there are witches in hun mythology, but they didn't mixed it up like the phoenix.Don't expect any music from the original movie, not even the instrumental one. And that beautiful song ""Loyal, Brave, True"". It is only in the credits. It is like they didn't know anything about the audience.Finally, this Mulan is too OP, she dodges arrows like Neo and does CGI parkour. The first wouldn't matter in another movie, the problem is that it seemed out of place.I give it 5 stars because despite all I enjoyed it, but I would give it more if they hadn't added that cringy things and commited that mistakes. I really don't understand what they wanted to do, I thought they removed elements from the animated movie to make it more realistic or to make it match the mythology but they did it wrong."
1044,"I grew up watching many Mulan version but since this is the first Disney movie with all Asian I really wanted to like it but it was a crushing disappointment. The lead actress is dry and I could not connect with her or the story. The village looks nothing like anything in China, the battle scene makes no sense (no1 saw Mulan save them but somehow they all just listen to her? Yer right..) I can't believe so much money was spent making this, even more that I paid extra for my subscription for this."
1045,"There's nothing worse than watching a movie and it doesn't make you feel anything... This adaptation feels empty and I don't want sound like a Disney fanboy, but it seemed to me as the people involved in the making of this film wouldn't put a minimum effort or love in what they were doing. I mean, obviously there are a lot of talented people, but I guess they had creative differences. In my opinion, it's a film lacking in soul."
1046,"Fantastic film. I loved the acting, cinematography, martial arts, and soundtrack."
1047,"This movie has nothing to do with feminism or equality. It's suppose to be about Mulan taking her father's place in a war in order to protect him. She's suppose to be normal, not all powerful. Where was mushu? Why is there a witch? Why was this movie made?"
1048,It is a beautiful movie with a heartfelt story line. Loved it. Never saw the other version. I would have love to have seen the emporer have more fighting being played by Jet Li and all. The lead actress was amazing to watch and doing 90% of her own stunts. Look forward to more movies from her.
1049,"I was looking forward to this movie for a while. The cartoon is one of my favorites so the expectations were high. 5/10 is for nostalgia and because I can only assume Disney made many choices in this movie that were commercially driven (gaining traction in the Asian market I suppose). So many times they did not use great dialoge from the cartoon when they could have. For example, when the father in the cartoon says: ""I know my place, it is time you learned yours"", in this version he says something like: ""I know what I have to do.."". Also, why remove all humor from the film? I regret to say this film was extremely disappointing."
1050,"How can a movie have great scenery, great fight scenes yet so bland, boring, cliche and cringy at the same time"
1051,"Let's start with the pros: the set design and art team did well to capture the feel from the original.Now that we got that out of the way, let's jump into what a mess that movie was.1) PLOT HOLES: When the witch possessed the soldier and approached the emperor, she could have just killed the emperor and taken power. No war needed, the witch can have her throne and Khan can just reign along side. You might argue that Khan wanted to kill emperor himself but the witch could just magically take Khan inside the palace. What's the point of the war?
2) The Witch: What was the point of this character? To drive home the point of feminism? To create a female antagonist? If these were the aim of the witch character, sadly it failed. Her dialogue were so pointless that I wasn't even listening when she was talking. How she had that epiphany after one chat with Mulan and then sacrificed herself to save her was so baffling and rushed. Character development doesn't happen after one discussion, they aren't light switches.
3) Chi: Mulan in the original cartoon trained hard after everyone went to bed. She worked at her fighting and combat skills. That was inspirational, it made Mulan a role model who worked hard and did not use her looks to get by. This live action got rid of this aspect completely. Instead it gave her and the witch 'chi' without a faint explanation why or how this chi came about. What is the deal with this??? I'm all for magical worlds but present this to viewers with well thought out backstory. Don't throw magic in just for the sake of it.
4) The phoenix: if we removed the phoenix from the movie would it have made a difference to the overall outcome?
5) Travel: Is it Mulan's chi to travel fast and become invisible? If it was then that would explain how she got past a large army of enemies without being seen and shoot at them from behind. As well how she can travel through the entire city to protect the emperor
6) Dialogue: many times the characters seem to tell us what is happening instead of just letting the audience figure things out. Example: when the witch first appeared to Mulan, she says ""Oh it's a witch."" Writers seem to not understand the point of dialogue.
7) Armor: Inconsistency with the armors, it seemed like arrows pierces the armors with no issues (horse back chase scene). Mulan's armor seemed useless against the witch's mini dagger but her fabric wrap around her chest saved her. Ummmmmm even if you argue she uses bamboo or other material to wrap her chest, would it still stronger than the metal armor?Had so much hope for this movie as I loved the animation original. This live action tried but sadly did not meet expectation."
1052,"Honestly just watch the original. For a director that wanted to keep things realistic, they just used it as an excuse to venture down a different path for the story. No music ""because you don't go off to war singing"" hurts my soul if you connect to the original in the title I believe the rest should be especially since the generation that originally watched the movie would of been a big part of the target audience. I regretted every bit of my time and excitement towards this movie and the 35 I paid for access to this. Disappointment."
1053,Good cast and beautiful picture. I have so much fun to watching with my family.
1054,"I can't help but have to write review. I have been looking forward to this movie for long long time !! Extremely disappointed!! In the beginning of the film, I thought ummm... not too bad , quite alright , I understand the mood it try to create of this mulan, so I might give it 7/10. Then through half of the film , nothing much happening but still watchable so I thought ok, I give it 6/10 perhaps. But then , after half of the film, really becoming unwatchable!! When the movie finished I can only give it 4!!! The only good thing is the fighting scene. And the rest of the scenes is like only a few takes then director said, ok, that'll do! With no tension at all! Totally not serious at all with each scene. Because there is lack of character development in the first half of the film and she didn't gone thru much at all in the first half of the film, so there wasn't any tension builded up and so once she decided to show her true self, which supposed to make you feel excited and emotional , make you feel empty instead. Cause you can't connect yourself to the story. Then you becoming don't care anything anymore for the rest of film. Basically , the story just really really flat and make you don't care and can't connect with any of the character in the film. Once you don't feel for them, you just don't care anymore."
1055,I wouldn't waste my time. Doesn't feel like a Disney movie.
1056,"Personally, Mulan and Aladdin are the best live-action Disney so far. THE GIRL who plays Mulan is really talented. She knows martial arts/sword fighting, knows how to horseback riding, and she can sing! I was happily surprised that she sung Reflection in Mandarin version (it's on the ending credits) her voice is so beautifully soothing and soft. The mandarin version sung by her is really emotional to listen... you guys should check it out
Anyway, for the movie itself, it wasn't like the animated Mulan 1998. I know people disappointed because there was no Mushu, but in Mulan's story, it was originally based on a legendary warrior from 2000 BCE China and I think Disney's trying to make it more to a realistic movie. This version of Mulan is closer to the actual story than the cartoon animated. It's actually a good movie and deserves watching even though they made some changes like replacing Shang with Honghui and taking out Mushu and replaced it with Phoenix (and in Chinese folklore, the phoenix represents woman so that's a good match). Anyhow, I loved the story and this movie is a perfect fit for you if you are looking for a film that can blow your mind over the action, cinematography & martial arts."
1057,"Oh my god, how boring is this movie.
I was really looking forward to see it. I never compared it to the anime and hoped to see good action movie with interesting characters, character development and cool martial arts scenes.What did I get:1. The main characters are boring and the development of Mulan herself didn't cached me, too. During the whole plot I couldn't sympathise with one of the main characters. The best and most interesting character was the witch. If they had made a movie about her it could be really good.2. The fight scenes are looking fine but I never believed them or took away in the movie land. I know that none of them are realistic, but if I saw Ip Man I was fascinated but the fast pace and perfect movement of Donnie Yen but the Mulan actress couldn't bring me to this point. Furthermore, the scene with the Trebuchet was actual braking the last bit of immersion in little bit pieces. Yes, it's a devastating weapon but slow and not really accurate. In this movie this damn thing hitting its targets accurate and fast like a modern tank with a laser guidance system.3. You, can recognize the green screen scenes. They looks artificial and so the remaining pieces of any kind of immersion are vaporized and vanishing in the fating nebular.4. End titles. Wow, they are really looking good and raises more emotions than the whole rest of the movie.Conclusion: I watched the movie to the end and I dind't skipped scenes. So we are going to a >=3 stars. I would set it 3.5 but I can't round it up to 4."
1058,"The best part about this movie was how great the cities look. They make mulan extremely overpowered without training, other than training to not hide her power (captain marvel?). Femenist hero films want to make the protagonist so perfect and powerful they ruin a good story (like Rey on star wars and captain marvel). It would be a great and inspiring story if they didn't try so hard to avoid giving a girl flaws, the overpowered hero ruins it. The other characters had no depth. The entire story is 'mulan learns to be herself', everything else are minor details and forgettable. But the colorful cities looked cool. I recommend the cartoon version. That one is great."
1059,Beautiful movie worthy of the silver screen. Although it's missing the musical aspect of the original there are still small hints of the original music in the film
1060,"Disney has totally rowined one of it's best classics. The movie has lost all the fun of the original version. No grandma, no cricket, no mushu. Jokes are pathetic... so bad that they are sad. They introduced a witch that is pointless in the story. Battle scenes are slow. Dialogues are boring.at the end, the final battle happens with a style that reminds of Indiana Jones instead of mulan. Why? Just, why?
Worst movie ever."
1061,"I was super excited about this film and is an absolute disappointment. The spark of the movie is the dragon and the army's jokes and songs. This was not included in the film, it is not even a musical. They also portray women of China as if they are submissive, in the part where her father tells Mulan she cannot be herself and to act more like a lady. The film is very boring and everything happens slowly, not much action. The reason I watched it all is because I was waiting for an awe moment that never happened. I am truly disappointed, especially because Disney is all about music and laughter. I clearly did not see this for being one of my favorite Disney movies. I cannot get over mushu not being in the film."
1062,"I dont understand why this movie is getting so much hate on here- maybe its because I never saw the original i had nothing to compare it to? Overall the fight scenes were a lot of fun, some of it seemed over the top but it really didn't bother me- I would have spent just as much at the theaters, so overall it was well worth the price"
1063,"Never interested in writing movie reviews but I have to say some thing about this one. It's not just a matter of good/bad movie anymore, I feel I've been insulted both culturally and intellectually.
I've never seen a movie with that much stereotype of the Chinese culture. If anyone was a bit serious about the cultural content and did a decent research, this wouldn't have happened. By research, I mean something more than just a poem describing Mulan. (Not to mention how awkward it is for trying to fit the content of the poem, word for word, into the movie) The original cartoon was a million times better than this one. How did Disney manage to backwards on cultural representations with lighting speed while have this all Asian cast?
And to be honest, this plot is so bad. I don't even theres any actor/actress that could have saved it. The two points was for Yifei Liu. She's beautiful. The witch was played by my favorite actress. Now I'm having serious doubts on her ability to pick roles. This is the intellectually insulting part. The witch character is so dumb and stupid that after the first line you can guess what she's gonna do and how she's gonna end up. It could have been much better if the Phoenix and the hawk were merged into one character.
I thought this couldn't be worse than The Lion King. I was wrong. This type of ""original"" is not worthy of my time and money. It will receive a much higher score if everything gets copied over from the original Mulan. No new elements or surprises. Those have seriously insulted me"
1064,I loved the movie but I got a bit sad because for me one of the best characters of the original movie was Mushu and Cri-Kee. But still I loved the movie.
1065,"If you like the original you WILL NOT like this!!Beauty & The Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King and now Mulan. When are you going to stop making mediocre live action remakes of already incredible Disney animations...actually not just animations, Disney masterpieces!!I gave this a 3 because I actually loved that this wasn't a word for word rehash of the original script (like all the others I mentioned above!), and that although there are no songs I loved the instrumental versions of the original songs that play in places during the film.But that's where the positives end unfortunately.Visual effects - 1/10
Acting - 3/10 at best
The villain - 1/10"
1066,"Ill start with positives. I really like the art direction of this movie. They really did a good job presenting China. The acting is solid but nothing exceptional. But that is pretty much it.Apart from bad CGI at some moments, pretty much everything that is bad, can be linked to the script or director.The script is no way terrible, but its nog good ether. This movie is a lot longer than its animation counter part. But it feels like they focussed on the wrong things.My real issue is with the director. There are some weird moments in the movie that could have been a lot better if she just paid a little more attention. For example. Its really weird if you have a beautiful set decoration presenting China, but the actors dont act in a traditional Chinees manner.Did i enjoy the movie? Yes i did. Even my girlfriend, Who's favorite Disney movie is Mulan, enjoyed the movie. But, no. I dont think this is a good movie and therefore, Disney has jet to make a good live action movie of its animation movies."
1067,"This is not a true remake as the other Disney live action films have been. It's so much BETTER! The bad reviews can only be based on the fact that they literally wanted Eddie Murphy to show up as Mushu.
Milan is a much deeper story and I'm so pleased that Disney took this opportunity to tell an inspiring coming of age tale. Loved it."
1068,"Actually it's just waste of time and money.
It's a boring movie with very poor directing."
1069,"This title should be added to a long list of great Disney movies that can provide young women with the inspiration to become more! That nothing can stop you.The pros: great actors, great characters, great story line.The cons: a little to much crouching tiger.."
1070,"I really appreciate the effort but I grew up watching Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese period pieces, and let me tell you with only exception of the soldier clothings, everything else are heavily influenced by Japanese culture and clothing than Chinese. shallow action compared to previous Chinese flicks. Added nothing new, chose to eliminate the good and adored aspects of the animation. I get it that it should not be compared to the animated but holy cow, that was not good. Maybe leave this to a Chinese director to make? So it could bring justice to a magnificent tale of women in power of their own destiny."
1071,"To start with I was trying to compare it to the animated version, it was sad to not have the comedy and iconic songs in but once I completely stopped trying to compare and watch this film as it's own, as it should be seen as the story of Mulan.
It was very well filmed, the acting was fantastic. Fabulous movie and well worth the wait!"
1072,"From the get go this film made it know it would not be like the animated classic. No songs, no talking animal sidekicks, no fluff. I feel the PG13 rating also showcases that.You have to go into these remakes with a completely open mind. If you expect the first version you saw, you will always be disappointed.This movie was honestly bada**. As a HUGE fan of Mulan as a child, this one really grew up with me. Showcased a strong willed, amazing women kicking butt and being proud of it. Total FEMALE EMPOWERMENT."
1073,"This has been one of the movies that completely wasted my time watching. I don't quite understand why it cost $200M, and so many aspects of this movie are wrong. Examples:
There is only 1 truly mass combat scene, and it is so boring. The editing focusing from the bigger fight to small individual fights was not smooth.Fight sequences were BAD. They likely did not spend $200M of their budget to hire a proper martial arts director. Instead of true martial arts fight sequences, they delivered straight-up westernized fighting which is likened to street fightingThe strength of the Rourans is consistent. At the start, they are this fearsome group of warriors that strike fear to their enemies. At the end, they were so weak that they couldn't even stand against a bunch of new recruits that did not even complete their military training fullyOverall editing is weak. The movie seems to be pieces of scenes merged haphazardly togetherThe entire culture aspect is JUST WRONG. I heard they used scriptwriters that were non-Chinese. Examples include the following: (1) Translation of the Chinese words on the sword was incorrect. Instead of ""Loyal, Brave, True"", which isn't exactly correct in terms of grammar, it should be ""Loyalty, Courage/Bravery, Truth'. (2) Which emperor wears GREEN??? This is ridiculous(3) No emperor ever leaves the city without soldiers. It is completely ridiculous.I feel like DIsney could have done a better job studying Chinese culture for a $200M movie, instead, they forsake proper research and settled with scriptwriters who do not know anything (ZERO) about Chinese culture.If you were to ask me what is good, really not much... I feel sad that they wasted so much money on a movie with (1) haphazard editing, (2) incorrect interpretation of culture, (3) overly simplistic story."
1074,"Unfair low rating from those who had expectations of it to be more like the original animated Mulan just because it's made by Disney. If you watch it from a fresh set of eyes / with no expectations, it would be a great movie as a live action film in telling the story.
Although, I must admit, it did feel quite rushed with some screen time given to the villains lore, but overall distributed.
Another point to note is that Disney is making it more realistic / different as they wanted to portray a version different from the animated classic. If everything were like the originals, there would be no point in remaking it action for action like a mirror, might as well watch the classic itself. As reference to Will Smith as Genie in Aladdin, he had some huge Robin William shoes to fill but he took a different approach as not wanting to be like the original Genie but added his own style. That's what we need for Disney to be more creative and advance further to bring us more stories we love. Just to name a few - Frozen, Pocahontas - stories that wouldn't be the same one we all came to know and love if they had based it on the actual stories they made the movies from.
So yes, it doesn't have to be like the original, if you want the original, watch the classic, don't bash it out on the life action film because it's not meant to be like the classic with its serious scenes of war and fear of being exposed."
1075,"A must watch movie... we should encourage our daughter to lead from the front . What a beautiful movie, we should all watch it and believe our daughters ❤💫"
1076,"All the great scenes of the original Milan were destroyed in this bad directed movie.The story telling is as bad as the movie moves on. The screenplay, the music, the actors; they all are bad.
Expected too much, really is a waste of time unfortunately for Mulan"
1077,"This is not a live action rehash of the animated Mulan. And, that's a good thing. The camera work is first class. You can see the textures of the fabric. The wilderness scenes are strikingly beautiful. Costumes are amazing. The lead role, beautifully played. The complaints that it's not ""Disney"" enough seem contrived. Rather than a cheap, martial arts knock-off, this feels more like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.The story line has special significance right now. It's good to see a film where honor is held in high esteem.My only real gripe is that the CG has that fake feel you get in any of the more recent Disney films. For example, Mulan rides her horse alongside some rabbits running in the grass. The poor quality is distracting.Enjoy the film for what it is rather than what you expected."
1078,"Nothing ground breaking. look at it as distinct from the animated movie and your given a bland action movie with a bit of women power that seems a bit rushed. Honestly this movie would've been better if it was about the witch! If you didn't know about Mulan the whole opening scene and first appearance of the witch makes you feel like the movie is about her.Now comparing it to the animated movie, it is a remake after all.It's awful. All the characters you love are pushed in the back or are gone. Her army buddies become everything wrong with men, the Phoenix replacement for Mushu does nothing, and it's just a hollow remake. While they tried for original over something like the Lion King remake (which wasn't live action at all) it just came across as not very well defined. I couldn't decide if it wanted to be an army movie, or a generic feeling Asian action movie. For all the calls that it was going to be a unique movie it followed the story of Mulan and didn't differ from the main story. Lazy writing, poor character development, and don't get me started on the magic..."
1079,"About the movie. it was just fine. scenery is truely beautiful. and I pretty like the leading actor anyway. hhh
I can see Disney's embition. they want it to be their change for historical and epic. but sadly the story still based on a fairy tale. that makes everything seems strange. it's not true and cruel enough. they filmed the war like a game. I wanted to laugh when seeing ten people rush out to chase the rouran. and meanwhile it's not fairy enough. so why don't you just film it like the original one since you hadn't even change your scription? oh I see. you wanted to promote the feminism again! I'm exhausted hollywood. I can see the reason they added xianniang the character. and why the scription became worse. the change the core from 'Mulan's growing' to 'how Mulan assure she is a woman' or 'be a woman'. Jesus. we really don't need that kind of encouragement. The original Mualn is great. strong and optimistic. they really don't need to change"
1080,"The visuals, background music and start are the only positives. The character development and story telling was a joke. Some scenes are just included for visuals appeal but just don't make sense. There didn't seem to be any chemistry between lead and general cast to empathise with. The action sequences are at times really dumb. Worst Disney film I've seen for a while."
1081,But this was so disappointing that I had to contribute to its low score. What a unwatchable disaster. So annoyed I went against my gut and spent the $30 versus waiting.
1082,"A great movie that truest touched my heart. If it appears in big theater one day, we will again watch!"
1083,What a great spin on the animated classic. Loved everything about this movie. Out of all the live versions this truly was my favorite.
1084,"I am baffled by some low ratings on this movie. In my opinion it is up there with Lord of the Rings. A really good cast, wonderful scenery, excellent plot. It is a really good melding of the West and the East. I expect it to do really well in China because it reflects so many Confucius Chinese values re loyalty, family, honour and so on, not easy to really get from a western perspective. A female heroine also is common in the East, as is mysticism. I watch many Chinese and Korean series on Netflix which have these special Asian flavours. Over time, many in the West will come to love them."
1085,"The backgrounds are beautiful but the movie wasn't great and for over $30 plus a Disney + subscription... It's not worth it!
I watched it two sittings because it was boring and I couldn't sit for 2 hours of it"
1086,"I just want to say there are many unfair bad reviews. I have watched this movie which is nod bad. I admit the storytelling is not quite smooth, however, I still enjoy watch the entire movie. The scene is beautiful and I like it very much! It is a good movie for kids to watch!!!!"
1087,"All the movie remakes have been very similar to the animated movie. This one just went a while other direction. I was excited to see it after Aladdin but this did not compare. No songs at all really? Not worth the $30 I had to pay to watch it.
Movie was good just disappointed because I love the animated Mulan movie so much and this just was something completely different."
1088,"It was only about 30 mins in when I realised it wasn't a shot for shot remake, and although I missed the songs, the orchestration on the soundtrack hinted at the songs while maintaining the high-drama of the film. More of an homage to the original, it works really well as a standalone film. I wouldn't reach for this if I was with children - stick to the animation, but for older kids / teens, well worth the watch.The CGI was a bit off at points, the colour hyper-real, but this could also be due to the type of screen I watched this on. The costumes were amazing, and the attention to detail of these really detailed.Watch on a bigger screen to fully appreciate the scale."
1089,"If you have watched the animated version of this movie, I think you'll be disappointed about this film. The story is slow, dialogue is weird, and some historical facts are inaccurate. The actress who played Mulan is not know for her acting abilities in China. The song you wanted to hear didn't play until the end. I was very disappointed after watching this film. Love the message about believing in yourself and be true to who you are. No disrespect to the director, but if the movie was directed by a Chinese director, it might have been a better way to tell the story I grew up reading about. On the other hand, If you like Lord of the Rings, then this might be a good film for you. C-"
1090,"Where is Mushu?? The best caracter is missing, I think this new plot isn't magical as the original. Its a cool production, but could be much better if it capt the loyalty to the cartoon."
1091,"The new Mulan is a beautiful movie! Of course, some things are different from the animated version, but some of these changes are nice to see. For example, while the animated movie moves very quickly through Mulan's decision to go to the army and her training, the new movie lets us experience her physical and emotional journey much more thoroughly. We get to see Mulan having to live with the men in the army and her fear of being found out. Mulan's decision to disguise herself as a man to save her father is one of the most important aspects of the movie. The new version gives us a much better picture of what that must have been like for Mulan (in the animated version, she lives in a mini tent by herself and doesn't seem to struggle too much with being a man and risking her life). Also, we liked that Mulan had been training as a warrior most of her life, while in the animated version she becomes a war hero in a very short amount of time. Also, while Mulan was brave and smart and learned some skills in the animated version, she wasn't really a skillful warrior. For the new Mulan, being a warrior was what she was born to do and we loved seeing her in the fight scenes.You could argue that the use of chi and the witch's role were not really necessary and took away from the film, but since they decided to go with those elements, they did a good job in how they incorporated them.We loved how the new movie included the avalanche like in the animated movie, but we wished the other soldiers would have realized that Mulan had saved their lives. In the animated movie we have two important moments that come from this situation: Mulan saves her team (including Shang) and she comes face to face with the villain before the avalanche starts. Unfortunately, we didn't get either of these in the new movie.Overall, this is an epic movie that gives us a more vivid and real picture of the story of Mulan. While we think some of the storyline could be improved, it is a great movie and very enjoyable."
1092,"It's not tradition Disney movie, but it's good to share with families together"
1093,"This isn't Mulan of the cartoon, but a great stand alone movie. Beautifully shot, great action seens and nice that it want a verbatim retelling of the cartoon. The ending was set up perfect for a second movie."
1094,"All budget. No talent. I enjoyed the beautiful scenery but the acting was poor, cinematography was choppy, the dialogue was corny and disconnected.My family's favorite characters were subtracted. And we were all bummed it wasn't funny.Simply awful. I'll never get those two hours back."
1095,"Seemed rushed, really really wish it had the same storyline from the 98' version. Like even a slight a bit of change would be alright."
1096,"An Epic Movie and possibly the best movie of the year so far and for me the best non-animated movie Of Disney Studios Of all times. Yifei Liu is excellent in the role of Mulan, Captivating The Screen and exciting. And also I understand that she's the one who performs the theme song Reflection ""The Ballad Of Mulan"" in the Chinese Mandarin version."
1097,"It failed on many levels.
The direction was like making a movie to teach Chinese culture at a slow pace to the westerners, probably her own experience in learning it before making the movie
The fight scenes were slow and unexciting and lacked the fluidity of 'Chinese Chi.'
The English dialogues are like coming out from an eight-year-old Chinese immigrant learning to speak English slowly - what an insult.
And Christina Aguilera singing the theme song? Why not an Asian one like Coco Lee?!?"
1098,Great movie! I was capiveted from the beginning till the end! This movie get my two thumbs up!
1099,"While the casting was beyond perfect, the choice of a non-Asian director kept us away from watching an Epic version of Mulan!
Additionally the storytelling was poor and very...""dry""!
And last but not least, when you are Disney, for sure can handle a budget for having the dialogue original in both languages, English and Chinese (Cantonese/Mandarin)!
A missed opportunity for Disney to create an Asian Masterpiece!PS: Seriously, The Avengers had more badass action choreographies! And this movie had Donnie Yen and Jet Li!!!"
1100,"I've been waiting for this movie ever since they announced it in 2018. Then it was delayed from March 2020 to September 2020 due to COVID-19. I had very high hopes for the movie, especially after learning it was a new, PG-13 take on the story. The least of my expectations were a great reimagination of the mountain battle.
It was awful. Every single detail was changed to the worse, and I'm a fan of making changes in live-action remakes. Not a single character was interesting. The fight choreography was absolutely awful. The quality of the visual effects loudly says ""we don't think this will sell, but we're doing it anyway"".
Judging this movie as a standalone, it's bad, but comparing it to its predecessor makes it worse. Bori Khan is bland, but putting him as a replacement to Shan Yu is an insult. Xianniang the Witch is a badly-developed character that just almost becomes interesting.
Mushu and the ancestors were removed, and it appeared as though they were trying for a more realistic approach to the legend, but the combat is so horribly edited and choreographed, it makes Mushu look like a historical accuracy."
1101,"From some of the worst remake from Disney in the recent years with ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"", I wasn't really expecting much with ""Mulan"" as well. However, all I could say after watching the movie, that I am quite pleasantly surprised with the finished product.Sure there are some contrive moments with how the plot developed, especially towards the end when Mulan single handedly defected the enemy to save hundreds of soldiers and how she again single handedly rescued the Emperor from the evil Bori Khan. I just feel that the ending parts were a bit rush, without much of a proper lead up to how she got there.Nevertheless, there is definitely heart and soul in this movie with the main characters development (unlike the last few Disney remake movies, which is really a whole pile of mess, relying plainly too much on just the CGI & special effects). Mulan played by Liu YiFei is definitely the right choice for the role. She plays the main protagonist with enough restraints and yet at the same time, as a viewer, one could tell that there is a lot of internal dialogues and turmoil going on in her life (especially with the choices and decisions that she has had made along the way, to lead her to where her final success is being brought about). Even the evil witch role played by Gong Li has her own peaks and valleys in the character, narrating her own story in her own way. She is just not a clear cut evil person, but just someone trying to live her own mark as a women living among the men in a Man's World. As much as she was the evil witch in the movie, I can totally see her be acceptable and probably be label more of a gifted new age psychic in today's modern context. It is clearly shown in the movie that Mulan is the new wave of leading female role, taking over the destiny of her own life, as compared to her predecessors in which this case, the evil witch or even her own mother have had failed in the past.As someone coming from an Asian Chinese background, I can definitely relate to how the whole filial piety means to one's family growing up and in this case also the entire country as such. Obviously the world has changed in leaps and bounds, in terms of some of the older fashioned ways of thinking that the female is of a weaker sex. As such, I can truly see that this new 2020 rendition is especially catered to a new generation of female growing up in today's modern world. On the side note too, this movie is directed by a female director and that certainly helps to bring the narrative across too. Somehow, after having seen quite a few movies, being directed by female directors, there is just some extra ""je ne sais quoi"" elements in their movies that most male directors just fail to bring."
1102,"Seriously, this movie is has the same plot as Great Wall with exact same scenery and cinematography and the same plot but with worse fighting. At least Great Wall had Matt Damon and it was fun for me every time he came on screen I could shout Matt Damon (ala Captain America) in a crowded Chinese cinema."
1103,"I like this one better than the 1998 version. Sure, for many who watched the 1998 in their childhood may retain that good memory. But to showcase a female's strength and confidence, this one does a much better job. In the animate Mulan, lighter tones, more humor, yet it's too kiddish to show Mulan's real strength with the male character's muscular body slightly dominating the power of Mulan, making her more or less dependent on the male characters. On the other hand, this one distinguishes itself from the traditional approach, Mulan is independent and is a leader.I like the fierce determination and confidence (her eyes show). Solid martial arts. A strong female with beautiful feminine features.Storyline is A Okay."
1104,"In my opinion, the film is delivered nicely. Of course viewers cannot compare this film with the cartoon version since Mushu isn't possible to be shown in this live-action film. However, there are some scene that doesn't make any sense. Overall, this film is good!!"
1105,"Me and my family love it. Great story telling. I just wish it's showing in theaters, that's why I only give 9 stars. Great cinematography and the story just touch our heart. I'm glad the characters are not singing. Without them singing, it made the show more mature and appealing to 12yrs above audiences."
1106,In terms of story. This film is very good and also very interesting to watch
1107,"This movie is very good,every person have a strong character and the plot is very good,you can sense the drama,the action ,all good"
1108,"Omg love excellent movie it is not for small kids but older kids is great especially for women and younger girls thank you disney. !!
this is the best one so far last ones i did not like that much like the beauty and the beast or Cinderella but this one omg love it love it"
1109,"If you do not compare to an older cartoon, this one is really perfect and lives its own life. The music, the locations + the end credits made me be loyal, brave and true to Disney for this remake. I am glad that this film is distributed to cinemas in the Czech Republic, not Online."
1110,I was really disappointed with the way this story was portrayed. All of the important build-ups were anti-climatic. The original story (both animated and the historical story itself) was full of drama and this movie fell short of that. The part where she cut off her hair and revealed her true identity were such big parts of the original story and it was glossed over. I wasn't emotionally connected to the characters. The fantasy element of the phoenix seemed random and forced. The ending was again anti-climatic. The acting was overly dramatic as if they were dubbing English over a foreign film. My boyfriend has never even seen the animated version and he thought it was bad.
1111,"Mulan is a story about women empowerment but throw it out of the window. Throwing out Mushu of all people, that dragon was one of the best characters in the original movie. Instead adds a witch, cuts out the song we will make a man out of you. The original was about a girl who uses her intelligence to become a equal to men, but the 2020 rip of portrays her as a strong girl, who can take down a Mongol Khan (Khan's are known to be expert sword fighters).
Garbage, watch the original, it is much better."
1112,"What happened? Back in the day, if it was a Disney movie, you knew it would be amazing. I have been looking forward to the Mulan remake for years. Unfortunately, I was so disappointed... The movie was cheesy, the acting was terrible, it barely followed the original story line, and none of the original songs that were so incredible were in the movie.
Not sure what is going on over at Disney, but they need to get it together.. Whatever leadership they have now is taking the company into the gutter"
1113,"I just watched this with my daughter and BELIEVE ME SHE WAS CLAPPING A LOT! It was just so refreshing! Such a positive, feel good movie! DO NOT READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS! these people are just bored and have nothing to do but say negative things about a really good film! Who doesn't want women empowerment?? Girls, kids, adults, people of all ages would love this movie! And to those who are pointing out facts, whoever said this waa based on a true stoey?! Its just funny. People this is fiction movie! THE most beautiful film of the year so far for my family! Definitely Amazing! Watch this and you will feel good!"
1114,"I watched this version of Mulan before seeing the original animated version and liked this production much more.As a lover of action movies I preferred the martial arts scenes in this film more than the songs in the animated version. And whilst it doesn't have Mushu the dragon her interactions with the other soldiers provide enough comic relief in my opinion.Also, I prefer the ending to this film more than original as I believe it sends a better message to women than in the original."
1115,"I gave this movie a solid 5 mainly based on the visuals, which were beautiful at times, I didn't hate it by any means, but when the movie ended I was left a little disappointed.Mulan's character arc in the original was excellent, she was spirited and brave but what she lacked in physical ability she more than made up for with her intelligence and tenacity. Her struggle to become accepted by her peers and captain was clear, it made her achievement believable and joyful.However, in the remake this doesn't happen, there is no struggle for Mulan, she already knows she is the best warrior, the only struggle is her deception at not showing it and this for me was a mistake by Disney."
1116,"A 10/10 for me and the kiddos! So refreshing to see Mulan come to life! My kids were literally clapping most of the time. This film left us smiling in the end. Its disappointing to see unfair reviews regarding this film, people taking things WAY too seriously. Why is it nowadays people have nothing good to say? It's a Disney movie! Its not based on facts its fiction geesh!!! This was a good film and the kids and all ages will love it! It was entertaining and action scenes were so good. We loved it! :) We hope to see more of this!"
1117,"Disney did it, they make a movie that even worst than Lion King Live Action. This movie is just Mulan 1998 with all the charm and love boiled away. Nothing makes sense, but there are 3 things gave me stroke watching:
+ Why give Mulan Chi power at the begin, is that the opposite of empowering. In the orginal, Mulan is just original human being who works her best to become stronger and achieve something. This movie, Mulan is born with super power, basically she is done deal at the start of the movie
+ The military leader force people to work hard or .. they got to be sent home. Then why the dad does not just go there, perform like a monkey and got sent home anyway, why
+ Why they even replace Mushu with that witch, the witch make no sense at all. The witch is just a stupid object to point Mulan where to go to the next plot point. And then she die, by taking an arrow in egle form, why she did not just turn into a billion bats like she did at the start of the movie, why
Honestly, I wasted 30$ watching this and it gave me stroke"
1118,"Storywise, it's flat and forced. Every time the characters accomplished the conflicts, the Phoenix shows up and 'whisper' to Mulan to tell her what she should be doing next, it feels like Mulan as the main character has no solid purpose for herself other than to protect her father and family. The story feels forced as there's not enough strong motives to drive the characters fight for something other than to save the Emperor at the end. Side characters have no big role to Mulan nor to drive the story or to put the stake higher, they're simply thrown in as emotional support to Mulan (she's still bland though) and as clown character (which miserably failed too, sorry Cricket), almost feel like the bonding between them is awkwardly forced, they're just stuck with each other and has to work together as a team under the reason of same purpose, plus they're the only remaining armies. Lack of characters development is the second big hole. Mulan's father is too good (too wise and too perfect) to be true as the Chinese is pretty patriarchal, it feels like he has no flaws other than his leg injury from previous war. Mulan herself as main character is stoic and reactive to the situation, not entirely sure she knows what she's doing, she just reacts on spot. Other than those points, the visual, set designs, and choreography is pretty neat and well-executed, as an overall remake, it's dull."
1119,"The witch added an unrealistic element to the story. It really distanced me from the fear of the hun evasion. I actually drew tears in the original when Mulan and her friends found the burnt village with the general's helmet and the girl's doll.
I actually enjoyed the concept of Chi, being a star wars fan. BUT using Chi to turn into animals and having claws for hands was just too ridiculous. And why is it that only the witch could transform? And no one else? There were male warriors that used chi too. Are female Chi users inherently stronger? What about male and female equality?
Also, that pheonix CGI looked like they added it last minute. Worst CGI in the whole movie.
I wish mulan had more dialog."
1120,"This movie deserves much a much higher score than it is getting. Yes, it is different than the original but that is the point. Visually stunning with great acting. They stayed true to Chinese culture and did not try to overly Americanize it (for an American movie). I did miss the songs but the songs don't come across the same in live action If you ask me.I love that the movie wasn't so much about the love story. It's 2020, It's important to show little girls and young woman that their worth is so much more than just ""getting the guy"" in the end. I'm so happy they did not have her entire journey boil down to getting married. Finally society is progressing past this.This movie was amazing and people need to stop being such haters. This movie should evolve past the 1998 animation and I think Disney did that wonderfully."
1121,Great cinematography. Good ideas that were poorly executed.
1122,"I must admit I don't remember watching the original animated version (so I won't/ can't compare it to the decades old animated version like most of the reviews I've seen. This movie was very entertaining and I enjoyed the action (with all the legendary action stars in it) I expected as much. The cast was awesome, I will watch it again and recommend to friends. Just how I thought the live action version of the story would be."
1123,"A lot of people are putting hate on this movie. I understand where it comes from, as most of people have watched the original Disney animation, which I consider one of my favorite movies of its time.Now if you look at the new Mulan, it has gotten rid of much of the goofy and fanatical characters and scenes (granted there is the shape shifting witch). I'm sad to see Mushu and Cricket go, but I'm also happy that the movie faces more realistic aspects of the original tale, where Women in Ancient Asia were disregarded as wives and daughters. How Mulan defied those original traditions of our culture has always been the core of the story, and I believe that this movie brings it justice. The actions scenes were good with interesting choreography and traditional floaty Kung fu seen in older eastern films.There are a few things that could be improved on, however. Some scenes felt devoid of any emotion, and I would have liked a few lines in Chinese with English subtitles.Overall, a better movie than I thought from all the reviews, and one worth seeing if you have spare time."
1124,"This is a Disney movie, please enjoy it as what it is. If you are looking for a real Chinese wuxia movie, this isn't it."
1125,Enjoyable movie 🍿 seen the trailers for movie and it lived up to the hype..good cinematography and backdrop filmed in my country NZ..whoop whoop 🙌🏼 covid crusher#
1126,"I was surprised to see the new role of witch whose appearance reflected that the minorities was not being accepted by the mainstream value, just like mulan was told to hide her chi. She also promoted mulan to find the true, take off the armor, show the long flowing hair and the beauty of famale soilder. She enriched the image of mulan, but at the same time weakened mulan's unique character. I think the witch should remain villain at the end of the movie and mulan's change should come from her own heart."
1127,"Don't let your nostalgia pit this against its own animated counterpart; a fight it can't win. Not one of Disney's greatest creation but it's not 3..4 star bad either. Weak story, weak acting but visually pleasing and entertaining as hell. A solid 6..7. Gave 9 to balance out the poor ratings."
1128,"Generally speaking I can see where they spent the 200M budget, the picture looks great. However, sadly the script is definitely a poor adaptation of the original animation movie. They missed the spirit of the original movie and added lots of redundant scene for feminism and unnecessary metaphors. All the characters are pretty flat and lack of character development even including the main character herself..."
1129,I'm gonna get straight to the point. This was by far the worst Disney movie I've ever seen. The acting was terrible. The script was terrible. And the character development was terrible. The plot is almost completely different from the original animated movie. I had high hopes for this but it was simple terrible.
1130,"The original animated Mulan was a mildly racist typical animated film with lots of non-Asian people voicing Asian characters. This movie is a sensitive retelling of the 5th century legend of female strength against male judgement and strict tradition. Asians say family name first, like Smith John. Family and and tradition are everything to Asians. There was almost nothing Asian about the first two movies, and that's why many people don't get this movie. I've seen it twice and got emotional each time. Perhaps it's because I'm half Asian. I get both cultures and enjoy the differences.Most negative reviews I have read here lament that this is too Asian. They want a live musical version of the cartoon. This has nothing to do with the cartoon. It's a unique movie that delivers on both drama and action. There is subtlety in the performances and power in the action. There is no way this is a 1 star movie. I just don't think audiences are not comfortable seeing an all Asian cast that is not full of stereotypes.There is also criticism of the witch character. I found her to be one of the most compelling characters. She is a metaphor for all women that have been rejected for being strong. Her story is one of breaking rules, showing strength and finally of redemption.This is an important film on multiple levels, and I may watch it a third time which is something I never do."
1131,"I was so disappointed with this movie because it had none of the humor or excitement from the original, yet the same basic plot points so there was very little surprise. Such a shame."
1132,"It does not follow the original animated Mulan, but the storyline is same.
It is very good and scenes are very beautiful, action packed and poignant."
1133,"I think the $30 price to watch the flick in your livingroom is driving the score down, cuz this was a fun movie. The best ever, no, but I loved it. Great job all around."
1134,"I'm not sure why so many folks are so down on this flick, perhaps it was the format it was released in and they just don't enjoy movies in their livingroom? Watched it with the wife and we loved it. Sure the character development wasn't as deep, and we missed the quirky dragon, but it was a very enjoyable flick and even caused a couple dust in the room type moments.Highly recommend, nothing wrong with this movie at all, great job."
1135,"We made it a family night to watch this and were blown away from the first scene in the tall grasses. Great cinematography, great action scenes and this had the best cast of any of the live action remakes. Li Gong! Donnie Yen! Jet Li! Boom!!! And the young actors were funny and had good chemistry. There were enough hints of the original with the music and certain scenes without trying to recreate everything scene for scene. Love seeing this new Hollywood representing!"
1136,"Beautiful actress, great cast and a boring movie. I've watched two times, the first time i sleep in the half of movie"
1137,Turning a great cartoon into a bad movie... why? Plus paying extra to a subscription service is nuts. Considering dropping Disney+. Just a flat story.
1138,"I almost never write reviews for anything but I felt like I need to after watching the movie. So terribly disappointing! Disney, do better. This was embarrassing although I think the main actress did a fine job.Horrible story, don't care about the characters, weak script, weak acting, I could go on."
1139,"I was somewhat shocked by the initial average low rating of 4.9.However after watching it for what it's meant to be, I love it. I was truly puzzled by some of the extremely low rating of ""1/10"".Anyway, I am seeing the overall rating improving as it should be.So if you watch it as it was intended to be and in no comparison to the original, you might just enjoy it."
1140,To whoever thinks this was supposed to be like the animated movie. You're dumb. They never said they were remaking that one. They made it clear it was supposed to be from the actual story. They did make nods to the original animated film. Plus they did add Cricket. Guess some of you weren't actually watching the movie. This story line is so good. I really recommend going into this movie with an open mind.
1141,"This movie had a lot of promise but delivered an underwhelming experience. Had they not slapped the Disney logo at the beginning of the movie I would've assumed this was a dubbed movie from China.The positives:
Nice cinematographyThe end.The negatives:
Poor story lineNot a musicalThe tricks, flips and fight scenes feel like something you'd get from an international B grade movie.Lack of character depth and story developmentThe Phoenix (what the hell?)I don't think this is Disney's proudest remakes and it felt like the movie is a giant cash grab directed at the Chinese market.As a Disney fan I am disappointed at this remake but also as a Disney fan I'd recommend watching it just because but be prepared to be disappointed."
1142,"Before I paid Disney $35(CAD), I'd watched/read lots reviews on it, I was kind of prepared and also got disappointed like others. The main weaknesses are:
The story is kind of rush. Mulan is not a regular girl, instead a kind of martial art genies. No smooth transition of Mulan's inner change from hiding herself to completely expressing the true her. The fighting actions sometimes look funny.
But when I watch it the second time, I actually noticed lots of details I missed the first time. The director and screenwriter actually made efforts to make the story complete, just some of the key lines are not emphasized so that they are easily neglected. And although a live version, it is still a fairy tale, a legend, not some realistic heroic action movie. We should not see it the same way as we see Brave Heart. You can clearly see this for the fact that there is not even one drop of blood on any dead soldiers' body. The main weak point is actually the performance of the leading actress, she could have had more facial expression to express more inner emotion. BTW, the character of the hawk is very crucial to the whole story, she represents the class of women who are crushed in a men's world and crave to make a change and meanwhile feel so hopeless. Millions of women like her fight in their own way for equal rights, it's their scarifies that pave the way to success for a small number of wonderful women like Mulan.
BTW, I would give 8, but give 10 to balance the low rate by the haters."
1143,"I enjoyed it. I've missed the grand spectacle of a Peter Jackson's interpretation of Middle Earth, but this is just the lembas bread to keep me going.Awesome armour, costumes, scenery and lavish sets: eye candy on the screen. Decent ensemble.I was glad to see so much of NZ again. I'm sure Mulan can see Helms Deep from the top of the challenge hill.When the sword falls into molten metal, I almost heard her say 'Precious!'Yet the Emperor says 'Rise up' with all Aragorns energy. Bad guys could even be orcs.Just missed the music of Hans Zimmer. Good job Weta."
1144,"Not as good as the original cartoon but enjoyed watching it for Liu Yifei. The story telling could have been better, felt like the story did not flow as well as in the cartoon but still think that the current rating is too low and unfair"
1145,I'm not a big fan of all the sing song animated Disney movies. They may be great baby sitters for children but the story line loses its punch with all songs. The live action movie is everything the story lost in the animated version
1146,"What a disappointment. This movie half assed being a Disney movie and half assed being a Chinese martial arts movie. I felt cheated out of the songs, Mushu, and the Grandma. They had such great talent with stars like Donnie Yen, and didn't really do anything with them. I'm fine with plot changes, but if you do for a remake at least make sure it is better than the original. Come on Disney - you're better than this"
1147,The best movie this year. I would go watch in theater. I like how they portray Mulan as the strong woman. I don't expect Mulan to be boring like the lion king remake. Every scene In the Lion king is the same as cartoon like really? This movie is not for you cartooner out there. this movie portray women equal right as men even better than men
1148,"If you go into this wanting it to be just like the original, you'll be disappointed. Go in with an open mind, knowing it's a stand alone Disney movie, i think you might like it. It's a tae Kwon do movie with no blood or gore. Still super cool fight scenes though.
Strong on girl power, weak characterization. Still a super fun movie!"
1149,Watched it with my family tonight and we all loved it! Thank you Disney for bring hope back into our world.
1150,"Aside from people's reasons for review bombing this movie and it's political involvement. The movie is quite average, yes it's not a musical and no Mushu isn't in the movie. There are times I found the English dubbing quite jarring at times but all in all, watching it from beginning to end the movie's message is quite memorable and a tearjerker."
1151,"Not as good as I expected. The story itself doesn't flow smoothly. I have no idea why they put so many merits in the story, like Qi, True and Loyalty. All these seemed very Chinese, but unfortunately, they don't. It is just too busy.
But still, good for a family to watch. You wont be very disappointed. overall quality is above average. Anyways, I wont watch it again, not like the animation. After watching this, I went back to the 1998 version to see my Mulan.
Other reviewers, are you sure you gave a 1 star?"
1152,"Very neat and smooth commercial film with no regrets. It is definitely the high-quality existence in the Disney Princess movies. Liu Yifei's performance is fine. Damned coronavirus, or I would have seen such a wonderful movie in the cinema. I want Mulan's sword. I don't know where to buy it.I love Chinese Kung Fu . Mulan in animation has always been my childhood idol. Now Mulan in live action movie has become my new idol."
1153,"It's hard to remake something that's already good, and that's on Disney's current agenda as it looks to want to remake all of its animated films into a live-action film, with Mulan being the last film and not likely the last to be remade.But Mulan succeeded. At least I can say it's more satisfying than some of Disney's latest remake films such as Dumbo and The Lion King, which both came out last year. With her beautiful visuals, hard-hitting actions and a story that still hits the mark even though it's not as strong as the animation, Mulan is successful.The story is not that different from the animation. Hua Mulan (Liu Yifei) is a woman who since her childhood (played by Crystal Rao when she was a child) is very active and often runs here and there, chasing a chicken up to the roof and breaking things around which annoys her village residents. and embarrassed her family because in those days a woman's only duty was to ""be quiet. Quiet. Graceful. Elegant. Polite.""Until one day when the Rounan tribe led by Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) and his companion who was a magician Xian Lang (Gong Li) invaded China. The Emperor (Jet Li) issued a decree requiring each family to include one male family member in the military and help withstand attacks from the Rounan Tribe.This is where the dilemma for Mulan begins. In her family only her father, Hua Zhou (Tzi Ma), was eligible. Her entire family consists of women, including her mother (Rosalind Chao) and younger sister (Xana Tang). But his father, a veteran, is now in a condition not fit for war, with one leg that cannot move freely and requires a cane to stand or walk.Mulan, knowing her father's condition did not allow her to join the war, sneaked out of her house at night, took her father's sword and armor, took a horse and left the house to disguise herself as a man and enlist in the army so that her father didn't need to register.With Mulan, director Niki Caro tries to stick to the heart of the story with his animated film version but also wants to make Mulan something new. That way he eliminates the musical element in this film. No longer do we hear the song ""Ill Make a Man Out of You"" when Mulan is practicing.Now Mulan is focusing more on every fighting action that I can say is quite exciting for a Disney film. Indeed there is no blood because this is a family film, even though the sword has pierced the chest or cut the neck, every choreography and every clank of the sword moves so smoothly and well that it makes every war action in the film quite grumpy.The film is also quite a sight to behold, with its grand royal exterior decor and colorful village interior. And also with the clothes of each character, from the clothes of the soldiers that look luxurious and also handsome, the clothes of the dark and intimidating Rounan warriors, to Mulan's own simple yet elegant clothes with dominant red. If these films are aimed at feasting on the eye, then I can gracefully say they did!But I felt an oddity in Mulan and it was the comedy element that was really off. No longer does the film feel as cheerful as its predecessor's animation. The atmosphere of the entire film feels really serious and dark, although there are a few times the characters try to crack jokes that seem half-baked.And that's what is lacking from this live-action film, because if we remember Mulan's animation, we know that the 1998 film managed to combine quite serious seriousness (such as the status of a woman who only acts as a male supporter) and comedy that makes the film feel light. and fun. Not with this film.But Mulan still managed to bring up a tough theme, touching on the topic that women can do what men can do, even better. And if these films were made with the aim of having a more serious tone, then they did. We will no longer sing along with the characters in it, but will be amazed at every jump, every slash and every run-on the wall which is certainly really fun."
1154,"The less you compare this to the animated version, the better. It is a vibrant and beautiful action/adventure fantasy, with powerful themes of gender roles, loyalty, and honor. My whole family loved it."
1155,"I saw someone say how it was bad. They were wrong. They gave it a 3 star because the ending was bad. No, definitely recommend watching it."
1156,"Well worth the wait. The interpretation was well received by family. Great lesson of integrity , brave & staying true to who you are. Lesson of going beyond people's expectations to higher limits. Beautiful acting & scenery."
1157,"I had to make an account for this. Mulan 2020 DOES NOT deserve a 5.6 rating. of course it's not a screen by screen remake like the lion king 2019 was. i can understand why people would want that but you have to chill guys.
the action is great, the characters are beautiful and all the actors fit so well. olden china wasn't this colourful but what's a Disney movie without colour. the sets are amazing. the cinematography is beautiful. the acting is laudable- liu yifei did an amazing job.
The khan's character missed some depth. If they could add the witch they could add Mushu. though i love this version- i don't love it more than mushu. there could've be an addition of wit and humor but i am not complaining.
i have both the versions in my heart."
1158,"Some may not be aware that the Milan legend is not just a Disney story, but like the legend of King Arthur, has been passed down for hundreds of years. No one is completely sure if Mulan was real or not.
That being said, this is a good action flick (minus the Disney musical soundtrack), with great effects & lots of action!
Mulan is a girl, born to a father who wanted a son. When barbarians attack the Chinese empire, the Emperor issues an order for every family to send one male, Mulan steals her aging father's armor & sword, and goes in his place.she has to hide her true talent for fighting because she is a girl, but eventually saves her entire battalion, and goes on to save the empire, gaining the Emperor's respect and gratitude."
1159,"Seriously, it was announced that this take on Mulan will be vastly different from the animated movie, that it will be based on the original story, yet people still expected that they will see Mushu and the musical sequences. The REASON for most of the negative reviews here.Now onto the things that I liked about this movie. Mulan's relationship with his father has improved. She doesn't need much help from the ancestors (thus the absence of Mushu and his replacement by a phoenix). One of the villains has actually a great fair reason behind her actions. It is more faithful to the source material and with it being a live action movie, it is more epic and is more masterful on the fight sequences.The actors in this movie did a great job, however the best acting goes to Gong Li's Xianniang. The villain that I was talking about. She and Mulan share similarities. They're both women and they use their chi, and it is forbidden in their China that a woman wields chi. The only difference between the two is that Mulan is accepted by her father, her comrades, and her commander. Xianniang was banished from her village, and Bori Khan, the other villain who looks like Shan Yu from the animated film, found her, and saw her as an opportunity to lead his army to success. Mulan asked Xianniang for help in finding the emperor. She told her that it is not too late to do goodness, and Xianniang was able to redeem herself, she was able to take the noble path for a while, before sacrificing herself to save Mulan.Now the bad stuff, this movie doesn't try to be much more creative. Although it is closer to the source material, I think that they could've improve more. Mulan's training wasn't improved. It's still the same. There's also the lack of compelling characters, with the exception of Mulan and Xianniang. It isn't as memorable as the original one.Overall, the movie is pretty decent. I enjoyed watching it. And about to Liu's message about the HK protests, watching this movie doesn't make you against human rights. It doesn't make you a supporter of the CCP. Watch this with your political views set aside."
1160,So the movie for a movie is fine.The lov rating is for if you are going to make a remake sure you can make some changes. But when you include a wich for some reason why not include a talking dragon. Mushu was a big part of the original 1998 movie.Also Mulan fell for the good looking officer that knew what he was doing. Not the self glad bully that changed during training camp.Also where are all the songs at. Including an instrumental version with low volume of the original songs i mean common what is that.
1161,The writing and storyline wasn't great. There was very little characterization for Mulan and the villain. Mulan's breakthrough moment fell flat due to little characterization. This felt like a made for TV movie. The costumes were gorgeous but that's about it...
1162,"This movie is more of a chinese wuxia film than a Disney film. Of course is not one of the best wuxia but is the kind of film I was expecting. A very well made family popcorn film for a Sunday evening. There are lots of Hollywood and Disney films much more worse than this and don't have so bad reviews. A lot of people expected to be an exact copy of the animated movie, that's why they were disappointed. I'm not a fan of Disney movies and I like wuxia films, and liked Mulan knowing it was a Disney wuxia film."
1163,"If you're looking for a exact remake of the original movie then go see it again, this one is different and surprised me for it! It's an almost 2 hour movie that seems like 30 minutes! The acting is good, the dialogues are straight forward and there aren't any slow moments! Visual is fantastic and the fight scenes are very simple and not really explored! Just loved it!"
1164,"I just watched Mulan and believe me I'm getting adrenaline rush!
What an amazing film.. Please make a sequel of it."
1165,"This is not the Disney cartoon - it's more mature, and yet walks the fine line of retaining enough of the innocence from the first iteration that it is appropriate enough for children to watch while shedding itself of the light-heartedness that made it childish. The plot remains nearly identical, with some slight shifts that better accommodate live-action. While some critics malign the special effects of the film, they neglect the historical nods to Chinese fantastical martial arts films, like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, the Ip Man series, Fearless, and countless others. The effects are intended to separate the film from reality, as a war movie based in realism is completely inappropriate for children. Despite the overly PC PG-13 rating for violence and coming of age themes, the film almost never shows any blood, and Mulan coming of age is gently insinuated rather than uncomfortably forced down your throat. Compared to other Disney re-make efforts, it is less frightening than the Lion King by a long shot and on par with Aladdin in execution (minus the cheese-y music). It does an excellent job of reinventing aspects of the Legend of Mulan, while at the same time remaining true. Not the same as the original cartoon...better in all the right ways."
1166,"I been pretty excited when they announced a life action remake from Mulan. It suits a life action better than some other story's but it's been done poorly.First of all I'm happy to see it's not an direct copy of the animation in terms of story. It's starts somewhat on the same foot but takes a little detour along the way introducing a Little magic and taking some away. This is all good and well if it was for the better but that's where they get lost. The characters are poorly developed especially the main characters. They stay somewhat the same the whole movie except they gain some skills but they are not grown in personality. Mulan grows a bit in the beginning but doesn't gain any skills (she already has them). This makes the story some what plain.So the story is mediocre but serves the purpose of telling about Mulan, the story we already know. Therefor I'd expected to be a visual masterpiece, and it is if it wasn't for the special effects .The scenes are well lit and styled, the outfits are amazing and beautiful to see. The scenery feels less recognizable but is stunning. It's less China and more Silk Road. But then there are the visual effects: they look cheap and uncontrolled. It's like they put form over function. The visuals do not serve the story, the story is just to drive the movie from scene to scene so they can show new stuff.If you're a Mulan fan or a movie fan in general, skip this one. If you like to pauze a move a thousand times to watch some scenery your in for a treat. Either way, it feels like a generic movie that's far beneath Disney A Titles."
1167,"Im absolute flabbergasted at the amount of bad reviews for this film??? Its absolutely EPIC!!!!
Ok I have never seen the animated film but, if its anything like this it will be fab. My only criticism is it is a war film with a lot of action and fighting and I would not recommend this as film for children, and I am a bit shocked that it is a Disney film.I really am not getting what people gripe about it is? Its beautifully filmed, amazing effects and absolutely flawless CGI. I think the people these days are really spoilt with films and because of remakes find it very easy to criticise something because they are expecting what they know.... Don't!!!!!
Watch the film as the film it is, its incredibly entertaining, despite my gripes about it not really being for children.... If thats what peoples problem is, say that, don't just have a go a criticise because you thought it was something else!!!I really have liked all the remakes that Disney have done, the Lion King, Dumbo, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast etc.... I thought they were all amazing. But if people want to be stuck into the old films and slate new ""real' versions of films, then I think you are very sad. Its not like they've not been done in fabulous Disney style with no expense spared, some people are just stuck in the past.So, I highly recommend this film, It definitely isn't for little ones.... I am going to have to watch the original animated one to see how they got away with all the war and fighting in that.... Surely thats part of the story????
Please watch it, ignore the people that just find it so easy to criticise, and make up your own mind.Very entertaining.
Well done Disney."
1168,"Such beautiful movie. We loved it.
I can't wait to watch it again. Hope they make part II"
1169,"Although its visually amazing, there is no singing whatsoever and the icon music from the original is missing entirely. Also missing is Eddie Murphy's character from the original. So, needless to say, this rendition is also void of comic relief."
1170,Watched it yesterday and I love it so much! I laughed and cried multiple times during the movie. Yifei is my Mulan!
1171,"This was a great adventure, with something to entertain the whole family. An authentic look at at some the Chinese culture while still mixing a bit of Disney magic. As a family of four we sat down with popcorn in hand ready to watch the film. If we're out at the cinema we would have seen it there, however at £20 we saved money as the family cinema tickets are more than that. We were not disappointed, the film had beautiful scenery, amazing action scenes and some funny moments as well. Our children loved it, and my daughter preferred this to the original film which she has seen many times. I would recommend this film, I think the kids especially will love it."
1172,"Don't trust the bad reviews! The people complaining that this movie is too different from the cartoon are the same people who complained that The Lion King was too similar to the original. There's no winning for Disney- but they should get some credit here. It's completely original and the casting was excellent. Stunning visuals, and they took more time to unwrap the original Ballad of Mulan. The story had more depth and complexity than it would have if they just stuck to the cartoon's plots and characters."
1173,"If you have watched the animated version of this movie, I think you'll be disappointed about this film. The story is slow, dialogue is weird, and some historical facts are inaccurate. The actress who played Mulan is not know for her acting abilities in China. The song you wanted to hear didn't play until the end. I was very disappointed after watching this film. Love the message about believing in yourself and be true to who you are. No disrespect to the director, but if the movie was directed by a Chinese director, it might have been a better way to tell the story I grew up reading about. On the other hand, If you like Lord of the Rings, then this film might be good for you."
1174,"As someone who grew up with the animation version of Mulan, I loved this live version. Yes, there is no Mushu,Shang and cricket (in animal form) however for this story they weren't needed.
Now that I've grown I realize that where so many other characters to focus on that I forgot this movie was about Mulan. The woman who became a worrier, the worrier who became a leader, the leader who became a legend is seen in this movie. We see the woman behind the legend.
I was a child back then and the story was told in a way I would understand. Now I'm an adult, I matured and the story matured with me."
1175,Absolutely enjoyed this movie. Would highly recommend to watch with family.
1176,"Yup, no mushu, i did miss my comedic little friend.
But regarding the movie itself i found little wrong, i did miss a little bonding to characters.
But other than that a very solid movie.
As said in many other reviews, it is not a remake of the animated movie.Definitly worth a watch."
1177,"Beautiful film. Heart and no giving up for all people, to pursue their dreams and reach what they deserve.
Lot of people seem to have lost their spirit and inspiration, and are not able to appreciate this.
And for many of them is more easy to spread hate and rage instead of giving a true opinion of what they analyze."
1178,"Honestly, Why not just appreciate the art and culture portrayed here rather saying the Animation was great"
1179,Really entertaining movie and thankfully not a copy of the animation.
1180,"The movie wasn't even average, it was plain bad. The story telling was terrible. Most of the scenes felt forced, like they were there just because the creators wanted them there. There was no build up to some scenes which could have been really epic. At the end, you feel really disconnected to the character and the story telling seems a bit awkward."
1181,"I love this movie as it draws strong attention on Feminism by describing the idea of accepting the true self and take the place in the world. It is quite different from the cartoon, I think you can view this as a brand new version of Mulan."
1182,The story is told nicely in a structured way. The dragon figure in the old cartoon film was cut and it was one of the best changes.
1183,"Father who watched it with his wife and 3 daughters last night. Yes it's not a typical Disney movie and yes it's not like the cartoon but YES it's a great movie and we all loved it, action scenes are fantastic, scenery fantastic and of course Mulan is fantastic."
1184,I really enjoyed this movie! It's definitely a 7/10
1185,"This Disney is not a musical and I think it's for the best. Aesthetically beautiful, this version of Mulan tries to make something different than the other live action movies from the Mickey Mouse company. It works most of the time even though we can deplore that the movie is too smooth and ""easy"" to create real strong emotions. But it's a Disney and it's a different world. Whether you like it or not, that's the way it is ;)"
1186,Loved it! This movie followed more the ACTUAL Chinese story than the animated version. Great movie for girl empowerment. Great action sequences and storyline.
1187,"This movie is not supposed to be the same as the animation, it's a recreation and it seems that people don't get it.
Special effects could have been better but it worked out good enough."
1188,"I never saw the cartoon version, but this is a ""classic"" Disney fairy tale with family honor and virtue at the center of the story. It's a no nonsense telling of a Chinese fairy tale with a Disneyesque happy ending. Witches & a phoenix are allowed in fairy tales, and thankfully they decided to not include any talking animals as comic relief. A lot of negative reviews take the movie way to seriously. #1 It's a movie. #2 It's a fairy tale and not intended to be ""historically accurate""."
1189,"Good movie, show the beautiful scenary and broad cluture in China, gives me inspiration on how to raise my daughter and what to expect, to be her Mulan!"
1190,"Boring, no emotion, and plot holes. Everything good about the original was ignored in this movie.*Spoiler Alert***Biggest plot hole that bothered me in this version is the the emperor's army/ fifth battalion didn't even see Mulan was the person who saved them from the trebuchets. Then they willimg join her to save the emperor?Oh and all the ""chi"" stuff made the movie really cheesey."
1191,"Great movie! The cinematography and fight scenes were amazing. I loved how Mulan was portrayed as a strong, confident, beautiful, and kind woman who loved her family and culture. My only complaint was the ending. It wasn't my favorite."
1192,"If you are expecting to see a copy of a 1998 cartoon film with real characters, this is not. While the story is pretty similar to the original one, they change a lot of things during the film. It's not a fairy tale, it's a 2020 version of the story. It's beautiful.After reading a lot of reviews, most of the hate is about the distribution method (not a good decision the extra money in my opinion) and not to be a copy of the original one (great for me)."
1193,After reading all the comments I thought it would be a disaster of a movie but then i thought OK let me give it a go as it is Disney's film and to my surprise I really enjoyed it. I didn't see the animated one so can't really judge and compare. Its a must watch!!!! Ignore all the Negative Comments don't know what they wanted lol
1194,"This was all around a sub par effort. It's like Disney decided not just to use Chinese actors, but also China's terrible acting, bad special effects, and bad writing. This movie is a great movie if you want to watch it and make fun of it, but if you want an actual good movie. You're better off watching almost anything else"
1195,"I am not going to compare this movie with the original Mulan (1998), because it's not a true story and anyone can change the sequence of events.
I found it very fascinating that someone had the gut to change some parts of the story, and to develop it in some more realistic ways.
A lot of essential characters where excluded but the core of the story is still the same.
I was taken by the production and the way this movie was directed. Very colourful, very catchy, and very fast.
Liu Yifei gave the character its right but I guess it would have been better if they kept Mulan's character as it was meant to, fun and enthusiastic.
It's very difficult for anyone to accept any kind of change in a story, especially if they were very attached to it, but my advice to you is to give it try!"
1196,"This movie was full of action, heatwarming moments and good acting.This was a very good movie to watch. Kids and adults liked it!"
1197,"Mulan (if you can call it that) is a joyless, soulless parody of the original. Disney was lucky to not have a wide release in theaters and everyone who paid $30 to watch it has been conned.
I love to show my daughter movies with strong female characters, but this was a cash grab, plain and simple."
1198,"This is a fantastic take on the story of Mulan, a great kid's movie. It takes a Disney classic and mixes in some Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon style action. The lead is intense and loveable. The cinemagrophy is gorgeous. I love the liberties they took to differ from the original, which made the story better. And, my daughter gets to look up to a courageous, independent warrior instead of a damsel in distress that is so typical of Disney. To those complaining that the movie was too ""fantasy martial art action flick"" like, they let you know that in the trailers. To those who are disappointed it isn't exactly like the original, I say ""good! That would not have been a good movie anyways"". To those that complain about the lead just ""annoying"", I say ""so are half the male leads you praise..."".
Additionally, they portray the inevitable truth that to make it in a man's world as a woman, you can't just be good, you have to be remarkable."
1199,"The movie it's self was good. However I think the lack of comedy and songs left the movie lacking heart. I also disliked the lack of romance, but I could have done without the love interest if only there was some other element to make up for it. The ending was lacking with Mulan losing the sword!! One of my favorite parts in the original was when she bowed down and presented the sword and medal to her father. In my opinion it is not as kid friendly as the original and should have had some comedic moments to break up the serious action scenes. Also not a fan that the hawk was brought to life into a sorceress. All things considered it was similar to the mulan story line and I did like the overall movie, I am just not one for all the changes."
1200,"Beautiful movie with stunning colors and cinematography. It stuck to the storyline that we all know. Yes, they could have done a little more in character development and detail in some parts of the movie, but overall, it was a good movie to watch as a family. I've read some of the other mixed and negative reviews. I think people are going in with too many expectations with its affiliation with Disney and the prior animated movie, and just aren't giving this movie a fair chance to be its own artistic interpretation. My seven year old watched it with me and loved it and would have given it a ten. He didn't go in with any expectations. He walked away understanding the message of the story and that women can be powerful heroes and earn respect and position for their accomplishments, and with some insight and appreciation for Chinese history and virtues. While he wasn't a critic of other minor inaccuracies here and there, he did pick up on the fact that there was fighting and death but no blood. I told him, it is Disney after all."
1201,"Honestly such a waste to see such an amazing cast and scenery put into this disaster of a movie. If this movie didn't have Mulan as the title, everyone would just see it as a generic Chinese movie. While the cinematography was nice and the acting was good the story was a complete mess. They made a 2 hour movie feel completely rushed, there was no depth to any of the characters and they completely left the themes of the original movie in the dumpster. I understand that they were trying to do something new and refreshing but this wasn't it. This movie was an atrocity to both original fans and the newer fans they were trying to reach out too. Better off sticking to the original animated movie."
1202,I was just hoping that they would stick with the original one. Mushu should be part of the live action movie.... and where are the songs??? Overall its a good one and very entertaining ❤
1203,"As a huge fan of the 90s animation and Chinese martial arts movies, it pains me to say it didn't fulfill my expectations. I cant really put my finger on it, but it was a weird mix of inorganic relationship dynamics and a flat storyline that didn't trigger my emotions as the original animation did. I really wanted to like it, but I ended up being bored throughout the movie and I even cringed at times because it tried to force a message that didn't really come naturally. What I remember about the 90s animation was the humor, which this movie tried to blend in, but the jokes never landed and left you feeling embarrassed.And it pains me to write this, because I know how much time and energy people put into it, you can see it in the visual scenery, the fighting sequences and costumes, but somehow it didn't seem authentic which I feel was supposed to be the message of the movie."
1204,Terrible storyline. Like tbh i was confused the whole time. And fight scenes looking soo fake. Smh
1205,It just didnt give me that disney magic i was expecting.
1206,"I love the original Mulan. But i hate all the Disney revoots. But this one brings honour to the House of Mouse. It has beautiful cinematography, great choreography, heart and balls (with girl power). We loved it. Can't wait to see it again.I love that it is different."
1207,"Its a Great Version of Mulanwhy do you always have to compare everything with previous ones.
I would have loved to see him in the cinema."
1208,"Been waiting for this movie for a while. Thought it's gonna be a great colossal wu xia epic from the trailer. But no.Beside the actress, I think a lot of thing is wrong here. And with that big budget can't they afford a proper wuxia and Chinese culture consultant? The Chinese culture is butchered a lot here. Although the cast are Asian, it doesn't feel like Chinese. Good luck if they want to sell this in China.The director and producers should at least refers to some of the early Tsui Hark's wu xia filmography and enrich a bit about the wu xia culture through some Cin Yung's novel. Even the anime got it right better than this one.Mulan character and strength development progress doesn't feel continuous. And the sudden twist in the middle and the ending is confusing. Dialogues are very weak.It's very surprising. Disney has some excellent story telling capability and some of the best stories in animated why they real life always fall short? This one is the most disappointing of all.There's no honor in this movie.#Mulan2020"
1209,"This movie was ok one time watch unlike the original which I watched over and over again in my teens around 20 years ago. I wouldn't be able to sit through the new one beyond this first viewing. I didn't like the over emphesis on feminism aspect. I thought it was OTT. The original film just made it look effortless it wasn't even about that it was just a girl that wanted to save her father. She didn't want to be soldier she just wanted to save her father and in order to do that she became soldier. Where as this film was totally opposite..this film lacked depth, also Mulan in the original had beautiful, funny, out of the box personality which is why she was different to the rest of the women and that is why she struggled to find her place. This Mulan just seemed too serious her personality was boring, and it was only her talent in chi that made her out of place not her personality. The film lacks the joyful journey, the humour, the team work, and companionship that was in the original. I gave it 4 stars as the cinematography, sets, costumes etc were good."
1210,"I'll not moan on about the original because it's irrelevant. For me it was a gripping film, with beautiful cinematography that I enjoyed watching (even for £20). Sure it was serious, but the action was fast paced, the characters believable and I was invested in the story and relationships. I will almost certainly watch it again."
1211,"This film is probably one of the better Disney Live Adaptation yet. Every scene is a spectacle and beautifully shot. Yifei as Mulan is also excellent, I have my doubt before watching this film, but she really did pull her weight, her acting as a man is quite convincing I would say. Donnie Yen, Jet Li and Gong Li also did very well and really carry the scene.This movie is also quite heavy on depicting Chinese culture which is great, but often done without any explaination which could be confusing, e.g. the use of Phoenix and the use of Chinese character Xiao has a certain meaning in Chinese, but probably will be lost in translation to many people without understanding Chinese culture. Overall, I really enjoyed my time watching this movie."
1212,I immediately fell in love with the main character as Mulan! All the considerations and aspects of the film are very good.
1213,"The acting, dialog and action scenes are all like a Chinese movie. They should've just filmed it in Chinese and added subtitles."
1214,"I've been a fan of Mulan and Disney since I was a kid. So, when I heard that Disney were making a live action of Mulan, I was so hyped!! I just watched it and honestly.. It could've been better.
Really, I don't care about the absence of Mushu or Shang. I think it's a good idea to follow the original story. I like the concept. BUT, I don't think it was well executed. I really expected Mulan to be an action movie and weighs on the fight scenes but it was so shallow. I still expected some musical, I mean they could add it. They could've made the training scene have more depth and sweat. Make it harsher and repeated because it makes more sense, it's the emperor army anyway. Could've made it musical in that part too. The battle scene is so shallow too.. I just think it could've been a lot better. I'm disappointed tbh, not because it's not as fun as 1998 Mulan, but because it was just shallow. Give it a watch tho."
1215,"I don't understand the hate towards this beautifully-shot film! The family values are firmly in place, the acting is solid and the scenery is incredible, showcasing some of the most exquisite landscapes in China (and New Zealand). The backlash towards Disney's recent remakes is a shame as not all of them are bad. My family enjoyed it very much!"
1216,"I am a huge fan of the animated version. When I heard that there's no music, no mushu and li shang, I was so angry, but still hope that they will create better version of Mulan. While watching it, I tried to enjoy and find good things on this movie but can't help to say these words too many times: ""why disney, why you ruin your own masterpiece"". ""Oh my God why"".The movie lacks of many aspects:
1. no heartful emotions between the characters (for example Mulan and his dad - lack of heartwarming father daughter moment; Mulan and her friends - they only mentioned the names but no memorable events with them, oh I missed their moments; Mulan and ""new"" Li Shang - LOL they replaced Li Shang with this guy but their relationship= Zero spark);
2. unnecessary new characters (and after finished watching I don't even remember who's who)
3. super horrible special effects (I can't believe it, again, ""why disney?"")
4. the battle was not grand and not memorable at all.
5. the actress is beautiful but no emotions stand out. I'm sorry but it was so plain and boring to watch her.
6. extreme shift key-point of the story.Such a terrible movie.It's just a standard plain martial arts movie, but they branded it as MULAN. Lol thanks a lot disney.Overall. The worst movie in 2020 (and in my entire life) and thank you Disney for ruining your own (past) masterpiece. Mulan has lost her magic. So so disappointed."
1217,"Mulan is one of my favorite disney movies of all time and I was looking forward to watching this film. I was half expecting this film to disappoint as I know there wouldn't be Mushu, cricket, songs, etc. But surprisingly, I enjoyed the film. I love the cinematography, the action, the feels..Please stop comparing this with the old Mulan animation. This is a movie of its own and intended to be enjoyed by more mature viewers, hence no songs, no dancing, and no talking dragons. I'm sure if Disney copied the live action with the animated one, people will still be disappointed (e.g. Aladin, Lion King..)
I am so glad Disney made this the way it is. I love it! The cast is great as well!Cheers!"
1218,"Mulan is one of my favorite disney movies of all time and I was looking forward to watching this film. I was half expecting this film to disappoint as I know there wouldn't be Mushu, cricket, songs, etc. But surprisingly, I enjoyed the film. I love the cinematography, the action, the feels.."
1219,"I fundamentally disagree with all the low ratings because it is not a shot-by-shot remake of the animated version. It is a different movie, telling the story differently.Cinematography is excellent, action sequences are fine, story is well told- if you see it as a new movie, then it is completely enjoyable. Not the best, but definitely a great way to spend 2 hours."
1220,I am a huge fan of the animation but I loved this one just as much. It made me tear up several times. I loved that the primary focus was on Mulan! I do agree it was more geared towards adults instead of kids. The kids may be disappointed but I was not. It was one of their better live action remakes in my opinion.
1221,"Very sad to say this but I was honestly let down by this movie, maybe it was just because of having high expectations created by the animation but it did not live up to it.I really missed the songs and they left out so many characters whilst introducing new ones which didn't really have as much depth to contribute to the story.
Whilst watching it I was also thinking about the budget of the movie, which is something I have never done before haha. But it just felt that they were constrained and that's why they weren't able to really highlight some of those big scenes from the animation.
However, I did kind of look at Mulan in a different way- they really showed her struggle with not only leaving family, but also her guilt deceiving her comrades.
They also completely took out the romance- which ok, they're at war- but that was also a big part of her gaining the trust and respect of her platoon in my opinion - Li Shang was their captain after all. Dunno though, maybe they didn't want to portray a woman getting with her boss 🤷‍♀️
They also introduced this magical element through something they called chi (her inner strength essentially). I loved this one scene where her father is telling her to suppress her strength in order to become a good wife and mother for the future. But otherwise, this kind of just didn't develop that much from there.In general though, as a lot of reviews have already stated, I really felt that the movie relied on the nostalgia as well as the viewers prior knowledge of the animated version of this movie and can therefore not really stand on its own successfully.All in all, it felt like a weak attempt at making it resonate:
they should have expanded upon the traditional chinese culture more (This version has a sister - let her get married to some renowned guy so the pressure really is on mulan to get married - but I do not know why they I created a sister to begin with though),really show the general struggle within the war (in the animation Li's father dies leading another platoon against their enemies- really shows the effect of war - which this one kind of did as it showed the aftermath but with a distance as we did not know anyone who died from that scene)and maybe also a scene or repeated references to how men look at the way their society is constructed / their views on the opposite gender (as this IS a story about the differences between men and women).Nonetheless, I still love the girl power In this movie adaptation. The introduction of the witch really sets the undertone of how women who have strengths, are perceived to as something evil because women aren't supposed to step outside the kitchen door.Maybe I will rewatch but the animation is still #1 to me"
1222,Loved it. Full of action... don't understand the complaints it was made clear it was more based on the Mulan legend rather then this Disney film.
1223,"Not sure what's up with all the poor reviews. Just watched this movie with the family, we've been looking forward to this as we are in Covid Lockdown, and the movie was really good. I liked the messaging for my children, helps with bringing the conversation of equality to the table. Donnie Yen always a treat to watch and was suprised to see Jet Lee, good cast, good story, fun ride. Steep price, but thought it was worth it for the family. Cheers"
1224,As a remake of Mulan it's very disappointing and doesn't capture the essence of the story. This movie is loosely based on the movie we all know and love. It is beautifully film and cast well and if it was named something else it would be better for this movie. I didn't feel like I was watching Mulan. Totally understand making remakes things are going to be different but this just feels like it could have been any movie somewhat a little close to Mulan. I was more inspired by girl power and independence watching the cartoon version.
1225,It's a lot more serious than the Mulan we watched growing up but still really enjoyed the movie.There are some characters that felt like unnecessary additions and made no significant impact on the story line but the main casts were great.
1226,"Poor acting, Mushu is goneBoring story that nothing like the original and characters are now totally different people.If I don't tell you it is a Mulan movie, you wouldn't even know."
1227,"It is good just not as expected, maybe there is a relationship with the current pademic which causes limitations."
1228,Simply the best adaptation from disney. I watched it and it brings out emotion from me. This is one fine piece of adaptation.. Although it didn't adapt straight from the 1998 version. 80% of it was there. I understand the emotion of mulan to be serious and cool since this is a real war.
1229,"If you expect frame by frame renake.But if you want a movie that's beautifully shot, well acted, well written, with well choreographed action scenes then this is for you.My only regret is I'm unable to see this on the big screen."
1230,"Mulan the animation should've remained untouched. If you want to see a Mulan without the best parts of Disney in it that is live action and good, look for Mulan: rise of an empire."
1231,"Pretty scene, pretty boring, pretty rubish.
Worse Disney movie ever."
1232,"I don't know why it has come differently from what I expected. Missed the influence of Mulan animation, where are Mushu and the other. using phoenix I did not like and even its appearance is very cool, I have not seen Disney events at all. Well the story tells of a brave girl from a small village, but using Mulan's name and then missing Mulan animation supplements is not good for me.
Even Jason Scott Lee acting as Bori Khan did not bring realism due to the physical body appearance, better Ron Yuan would have acted as Bori Khan. Even the fighting and the ending of Bori Khan was too easy.
This Movie Lost the touch of real Mulan Story because you change it a lot."
1233,"I have been waiting for more than one year but Disney just paltered with the task and fooled me with this movie.You can tell from soooo many scenes that how little cares Disney paid on the details of this movie. Such as the ugly Chinese fonts that look like they copied from Microsoft Word, bad quality props and costumes they bought from Amazon, couplets (the Duilian sticked on the wall of matchmake's house) make absolutely no sense and are written in simplified Chinese characters lol...It's 2020 now but this movie is still full of stereotypes of China from the last century, showing no respect for the culture or people who love the story of Mulan. I wonder if they even hired anyone from China in their team?As a live-action remake, I didn't expect much, but it still disappointed me so much with its arrogance, I really loved the animation Mulan, wish it could be better."
1234,This is a beautiful movie. A lot of reviews are biased. The funny parts of the original Disney movie are missing but the setting and acting is brilliant and a very nice movie to watch.
1235,I've a great time watching this movie. A lot of references to the cartoon. Recommend to watch.
1236,It was boring to watch. The only character I rooted for was Cricket. It was more interesting to follow his development than Mulan.
1237,"One of the better Disney remakes kids absolutely loved it which is the main thing. Changed a few things from the original but still a good story, visually very good and good action scenes."
1238,"Inspirational, beautiful cinematography....movie should have been little bit longer."
1239,"We just finished watching Mulan live action and are so glad its finally over. Charmless, devoid of emotion, and poorly acted this movie is a drag to watch. It tries to be two things at once and fails at both. It attempts to create the classical Chinese action drama or the American popcorn flick appeal and just gets so lost along the way. Do not pay for this movie. Its not worth the store bought popcorn."
1240,"No character development, with a jumpy, fast paced story. mediocre effects that you'd expect from a high B list movie but don't quite cut it for a ""theatrical premier"" movie.You don't get to hardly know or learn anything about the characters so there's no attachment to anyone.Gets a 2 star because the ending credit songs and animation were good"
1241,I went in knowing it would not have the songs or Mushu and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the film. I loved the characters and more serious tone of the film. Now one of my favourite live action Disney films
1242,"First off - realise that this Mulan adaptation is not based off the Disney cartoon so much as off the ORIGINAL Chinese folklore.
Secondly, separate your enjoyment of the movie to your sentiments on the lead actress' political views.Once you view this movie in that context - it is a beautifully crafted movie that actually quite faithfully carries the themes from the Disney animated, albeit without talking dragons and dancing on the way to battles. Beautiful locations (New Zealand part of that hehe), amazing sets and costume designs that feel authentically Chinese yet also Disney-esque, and choreography that reflects the dramatised martial arts style of Chinese Kung Fu movies (ala Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). Director Niki Caro did a great job trying to bring in more Chinese elements into the movie than the cartoon did to build more authenticity (eg. incorporating concepts like 'chi') into the setting of that world.
View this as it's own movie, not compared to the animated film before it, and you will find a beautifully crafted movie which carries a timeless message.Enjoy!"
1243,Great movie. The visuals were beautiful. I loved how the score used the music from the animated movie. The fight choreography was amazing. This is a highly enjoyable film.
1244,"Majority of watchers already know how the story goes. I felt something was just really missing throughout the entire movie. The lack of the soundtrack that made the original animation version so touching was a miss for sure. The Witch character by Gong Li was completely pointless. And I feel (like others have mentioned) that deeper character arcs were just really absent from the movie. We don't get to see Mulan's inner turmoil in taking her father's place, we don't see the realization from her father once he realizes the sacrifice his daughter made. The iconic hair-cutting scene was absent too. Early press interviews indictated that Mushu's absence was due to wanting Mulan's camaraderie with her fellow men to be the focus but I saw zero depth between her and the men; the only thing we get in the obvious attraction from Honghui, which was a lame replacement for the animated version's Shang Li. The final battle scene was so Hollywood and made me roll my eyes. Mulan's efforts in saving the entire palace of people was also incredibly underscored in this version. Just very anticlimactic. And random, and I don't know if this was on purpose or not, but Yifei Liu looked half asleep in nearly all the scenes of her out in the desert on the horse. She looked really tired. And I love how once she decides to be ""true"" to herself...she lets her hair down and returns to the battle field with a super-clean face that's considerably paler than how she appeared for the first half of the entire movie. Come on....I will say the set visuals overall were nice, but I've watched enough Chinese period dramas to know how massive and to-scale Hengdian Studios is with Chinese palaces and forts. So maybe impressive to others, but not super surprising to me. This movie reminded me a lot of the live-action ""Aladdin"" remake -- great visuals, but something is just missing story-wise. Many things cut from the animated version just take away from the belief of the live-action version.That all being said, I still think it was great for Disney to give Asian faces and Asian stars a chance to shine and represent a folktale known by generations.I'd say watch this if you're curious, but if you don't -- you're honestly not missing out on anything."
1245,"Overall s good, but the story moved too fast n need more impact scene like war scene for the killing part of this movie, im here just want to appreciate hard work of all actors, keep it up disney 💪"
1246,DONT believe what you heard about this movie.. For me as a normal person reviewing this movie i think it was a good movie.. First of all dont compare this version with mulan cartoon version... Cartoon they can make any movie interesting and ridiculous like lion king... About the lead actress what if she's from wuhan anyway... She's still good at acting. Dont be biased..
1247,"If you watch this movie with the hopes of it being similar to the animation then of course you would be disappointed. Regardless, I thought the movie was great. First you have Asian actors speaking in English and you can already tell it isn't their first language. Second, the fight scene was good but every one is expecting this great action film when this is still a Disney film. It still follows the animation's story line but it was great in its own way. I liked that the eagle was a character because it was a good transition. Yes, I'm bummed Mushu wasn't an actual character but a Phoenix was good as well, to symbolize her as a warrior. I wanted more Donnie Yen action and I absolutely loved that the emperor played a fighting role. I also wished Donnie Yen was her love interest, but oh well. It was a good movie!"
1248,"I understand why some people may feel divided about this film but I thought it was a beautiful movie with a very important message it stays true to the story and I'd almost guarantee if that you enjoyed Mulan as a child and as an adult as well this story will bring tears to your eyes and the performances of the actors were pristine to say the least, I will definitely be watching it again :')"
1249,"We as a family really enjoyed this, Not for the very young in the family but us 2 old fogies 52 and 53. And my 13 yr old daughter were gripped. Not for the die hard Mulan fans but as a stand alone movie it was brill. Cant fault anything in the movie.
Disney movie so dont expect to much in the fight scenes,But all done very well.CGI was on point as were the costumes. score and scenery."
1250,"I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that almost all of the low ratings and reviews are disgruntled folks that felt that they should not have to pay extra for a movie on their precious Disney +. This movie was always going to be in theaters first as a likely blockbuster then Blu-ray and digital ""then"" maybe a year later it would have ended up on Disney +. Add in the fact that the lead Lou Yifei was the subject of a boycott attempt because of statements she made regarding the unrest in Hong Kong and you have a recipe for unhappy pandemic reviews. Most of these might have not even actually watched the movie.
I found the movie to be extremely well done. It was powerful and uplifting. Go in to it with an open mind and you will likely enjoy it as much as I did. Seeing Donnie Yen & Jet Li was also cool. Have fun folks!"
1251,I don't know why everyone is hating this movie. It's the best live action remake ever!
1252,"I give it a solid six, not to say I was expecting more from it neither was I expecting less. Considering the way Disney has been making live actions of their movies with some successful ones ie;Jungle book with others not as successful ""Lion King"". It's safe to say that this has fallen in the mid tier range. With an amazing cast no doubt about that, an amazing cinematography which is a pity because it isn't being shown on the big screen. ""There have been many tales of the great warrior Mulan. But ancestors, this one is mine"".. these were the opening words of the movie and I find it smart that they added a narrator in this movie telling us ""his ""version Mulan . It lacked a lot of things that the original animation had such as Mushu etc... But with those different aspects absent it paved a way for the character Mulan to be fully exploited. Carrying the same tenacity and bravery as we know how Mulan should be. It was honestly a very interesting take of the movie which was not disappointing but for many Mulan fans it could possibly be a let down. But it will definitely be an enjoyable movie for the new Mulan fans. Will it have a lot of ratings? I doubt it,which I find it a pity because if it were debuting in cinemas this would've been a completely different story."
1253,"When previews of this movie came out I thought that it would be the best live action adaptation of a Disney animated film yet, and I was right. A strong female lead with a great supporting cast. Donnie Yen and Jet Li were great as always. Don't listen to the negative reviews if you're not as nitpicking or toxic as most who gave negative reviews. This is not the Disney animated version and it's great for it."
1254,"Blood effect is the main problem... coz people wants to see the blood and killing more realistic...
Otherwise movie is good... The only issue which people are complaining about that it took place in China and Chinese culture. It's a good film try ot out."
1255,I recommended to watch it. This movie did well to match between fairy tale and Asian calture.
1256,"Just finished the movie and I am so disappointed I can barely write so this review will be done with bullet points.The Good:
The cinematography is beautiful, and there are some really nice panoramic shots. I originally planned to give this movie 1 star, but figured it should be at least 2 due to the production quality.Touches on the topic of female empowerment.That's it.The Bad:
The dialogue was extremely stilted and awkward to the point where I would notice it every few lines. I feel like the script also negatively affected the acting as well.There was a distinct lack of focus on Mulan's relationship with the other soldiers, and overall the movie lacked the same sort of warmth that was shown in the Disney animation. I didn't care about the characters at all.They completely skipped over the process of Mulan working hard to overcome the difficult training in the army. That should've been crucial to developing her character like it was in the animation, but instead the audience just gets shown a shot of her magically improving one day.No music from the original Disney animation, which is made even more disappointing by the lack of unique musical score. At times the instrumentals sounded more Indian and Middle Eastern than Chinese.Fight scenes were surprisingly boring and overdone, the choreography felt like something I've seen a million timesOverall the movie just felt bland and emotionless, and I didn't really care about any of the characters in the end."
1257,"For those that give lower than 7, I can understand. We grew up watching the Disney Mulan (1998) and most probably majority of the people are expecting something like a Live Action version of the Mulan (1998). Expecting to have the songs (like other disney movie) in the movie, the singing and funny scene from mushu and stuff. But no, this is not a live action of Mulan (1998). I would say, it is its own version of MULAN movie with same plot story as Mulan (1998). If you watch it without high expectation from Mulan (1998), then this Mulan (2020) actually isnt half bad. It was great actually and I enjoyed it. However, as a Disney Movie (any disney movie), I think that they should have include the singing and songs in the movie and not just the music (and only part of it). Try watch it without expecting it to be a Mulan (1998) and you will enjoy it :)"
1258,"Well, it's not an anime. The story is coherent, graphics are true, and Mulan's character is well developed. However, the movie seems to be a bit short. I was expecting it to be a bit longer. Also, there's no love story as it did in the anime. Commander Tung's martial art skills could have been more elaborated and displayed by international action star Donnie Yen. For those reasons, I give it a 9."
1259,"First, this movie shows no respect to foreign culture. Clothes and architecture in different time and places are combined as one.
Also, the costume is a disaster. It feels odd to see all the colours they used in this movie. Not to mention those were not the colour used in ancient China. In ancient China, colours and patterns represent social ranking. It feels embarrassed to see the emperor in a costume more humble and poor than the others.
Last but definitely not least, the removal of the songs has decreased the strength of plot and characteristics. It won't be a problem if the songs or characters from the animation are removed. But it would be a problem when there is no replacement to emphasise the theme or the epiphany of the character.
This is surely the worst movie I have ever seen."
1260,''Twas fair fun to watch with the family but nothing so much that got me impressed. I wonder how would Ang Lee approach the film if he did not decline because of prior commitments it might be more magical.
1261,"This movie is not even good as a stand alone film. But as a remake, and comparing it to the original makes it that much worse. The original Mulan is one of my favorite movies and I waited so long for this movie to come out and was incredibly excited. What a disappointment! They took out everything good from the original, all the amazing songs, witty humor, MUSHU, and even the plot and storyline. I'm fine with remakes not following the exact path of its predecessor, especially if they improve it, but this was a pretty much completely different story that is loosely based on the original. They breeze through parts that, in the original film, were main points for character development and building up momentum. Plus they introduce so much magic that it makes everything logical in the movie so useless.Is weird to say that the cartoon had better cinematography than the live action version? Not to mention better acting. That chilling part when the Huns charge and the soldiers come down the mountain by the thousands used to make my heart skip a beat. The war scenes in this film are just boring and overly choreographed. Mulan's flips and magical moves are really too much and it makes the war scenes kind of pointless. She was much more believable in the cartoon for the fact that, yes while she was a skilled fighter, she also used her brain and devised clever plans and tricks many times to overtake the enemy. She didn't just magically do flips and kick an arrow into the enemy's heart.With all that said - this movie is TERRIBLE and I do not recommend if you don't want to ruin your image of one of the best Disney movies"
1262,"I loved it! I didn't expect the reimagining of Mulan to stray too far from the animation and I expected that the story would ensure that our younger viewers would comprehend the plot. My daughter's 7 and 11 cried and were with Mulan every step of her journey. The story didn't have to be over complicated. The acting, the cinematography and music all superb. Watch with an open heart and you won't be disappointed x"
1263,"From the start until the credits, I watched this movie with hope.
The production work feels amazing throughout the movie, the scenery, the midst that revolved constantly around the main character.
The work done around Xian's performance is cinematographicaly great, there's absolutely no lacking there.
This is the type of movie that someone that preys on character development would enjoy to a certain extent, as the drama that revolves around our heroine is noticeable and again, to a certain extent, well played.We follow a girl that had been helding back her true virtues, and to my disapointment, by the end of the movie I couldnt just let go of the thought that we had only seen around 5% of her true potencial.
With every step of her journey, it's possible to feel brief and faint character advancement, but when it truly matters storywise, it just felt too easy.About the fights. I honestly thought they were enjoyable as a whole but as we get little notion of a timeframe, some elements seem to be too scattered and as the movie goes on combat feels weaker and weaker. I couldn't help but to wonder ""Did a small batallion of newbies just hold of a regiment of shadow warriors sent to assassinate the emperor?"", ""How much time did they really spent training? Weeks? Months?"".And I truly hope, with all my being, that there's a version of this movie in native tongue. English in this setting felt a bit awkward and forced in some lines.In conclusion, as entertainment this movie as a whole felt good, the plotline and scenery is light and pleasing to the eye, I can say I enjoyed this 2 hours.
Objectively, I'd have enjoyed it more if the last quarter of the movie wasn't so rushed, the fights could've been more epic and other characters could've had more light shine on to them so the plot could feel more natural."
1264,I never write reviews But I felt the need this time. I don't know whats with all the bad reviews. It resembles the original and for a live adaptation it was good. It was different but not butchered like so many other re makes. It is a must see.
1265,"It's just horrible, disney has lost its ability to make good movie, they should just stick with their superheroes action flick instead, the writting, the plot, the characters, everything in this is cringe"
1266,"The title said it all.People gave bad ratings because they think this Mulan isn't like other Disney movies. I mean, this non-disney type of movie is a good change. Without the musical, I enjoyed it very much. The action and computer graphics are great. The main actress is pretty. To be honest, I would rate this movie an 8/10."
1267,"Honestly, I really enjoyed this version! If you go into this movie expecting a sing-a-long style remake of the original, you'll absolutely be disappointed. They cut characters that were intended for comic relief. They cut the love story. They made Mulan closer to the character from the ballad, and frankly, she was incredible! Yes, it lacks the humor of the original, but you truly see how strong Mulan is. The acting was fine. It had a few throw back moments, that offered some insight into where you were plot wise. It is a more mature version of the story! The reason I didn't give it 10 stars is because I would've loved to see more of Xianniang. Also, I would not recommend it for the younger crowd, not because of violence, but because it lacks the elements to keep them interested."
1268,"Void of any strong emotion. Exploitative of a feminist storyline that ultimately even fails at being feminist. Completely forgettable.Also, the fake bots giving it 9 or 10 are rampant."
1269,"I watch the original Mulan animated movie years ago, knowing they made huge changes beforehand, I dive into this movie with a mindset that this is nothing like the original, that I should enjoy it like a standalone Mulan movie. Still, it was bad to meh. I will avoid spoilers so many of my points will be vague.A movie empowering women and telling them to let go of the ""shackle"" that holds them back, to be themselves and they will discover the power that lies within, but they execute this concept horribly.
The huge issue is they build her up at a Mary Sue character, not her characteristic that made her a Mary Sue, it how she achieves everything, even with the settings of the story, you can still feel that she achieve everything so easily, and it not because she try, that have to throw in some ""special element"" that makes her unique. Talk about taking ""the power that lies within"" literally. Even then, they seem to forget about that special mojo after 1/3 of the plot.The pacing is also the issue, almost 2 hours long, but it feels rush, especially some scenes that can be used to flesh out the character and added more depth to her, but it feels rushed somehow. Even though I try to not compare this version with the animated one, the fact that a lot of scenes are the same, I have to say that the animated was better at establishing Mulan as Mulan, not just some generic she a special main woman character with no depth to her personality. They also try to cram in more original character, but what the points when you can't even have enough screen time for your mains.The characters/ actors were also an issue for me. First is Liu Yifei, I liked her and has high hope for the actor, well, for the first 2/3 of the movie, she was okay, but in the last portion, she expresses little to no emotions, and the last portions are the most dramatic ones, too, such a shame. Li Gong as Xianniang, an original antagonist that serves as a mirror to the character of Mulan, also did not leave any impression either, not only the character doesn't express many emotions, the way they write and cram her character arc was just... sad, very bad writing. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined, that all I can say. Other supporting characters were meh AT MOST.The special effects, musics, actions were average. For Disney, this saying something. It feels expensive, and cheap, at the same time. There was no memorable scene. The whole film was not even a visual feast in my opinion.One dimensional character, mediocre, if not, bad acting, average special effects, scores,... has made the 2020 Mulan a huge disappointment for me, if the audience is kids, I think they will wholely like it, but for adults, especially people that grow up watching the original Mulan, prepare to be disappointed, one way or another.
Rant: Yeah, this is a small segment for me, cause I really, really want to rant about one ""special"" character in the movie, and personally, that character killed the whole experience for me. It Cricket, I seriously hate how he is written, how an insignificant character that can agitated me so, so much. What is the purpose of this character, a comic relief, you every weak, cowardly guys but in the end learn to be strong types?? Poorly written, serve no purpose to the plot. I don't hate the actor, I hate the characters. You literally can cut this character out and it will make no different to the plot and the movie."
1270,"Don't let the opinions of others ruin your experience (those trying to get another copy-paste of a cartoon story). It's beautiful, well presented and full of great details in design, photography and these interesting background of the history. Another point of view of a great story. It doesn't compete with the first lovely Disney's Mulan, it's different in a great way."
1271,"I have never done a movie review before , but this movie was so amazing I just had to ! This movie is absolutely beautiful . From the story line, the scenery , and the thoughtfulness of details . Everything was hand picked and the actors were perfect for the roles they were assigned. I'm a big enthusiast on Disney Movies , and I like how they stuck to the classic with a twist . Phenomenal job !!! Off to go watch it again now 😊"
1272,"This was the treatment Mulan deserved all along. It captures the heart and essence of the original while providing so much more in terms of the legend of the loyal, brave and true hero that is Mulan. Beautifully done, rich with color and sweeping shots of stunning landscapes. If you go into it expected a faithfully reenactment of the original, you will miss out on the original take that this movie provides that is so much more. It feels more like an epic Kung Fu reimagining on par with Crouching Tiger with all the high flying fast moving action you would expect. Give this outstanding story of bravery and loyalty a chance, you won't be disappointed.*(note, it is more intense, so not for little littles)."
1273,Excellent movie. I don't know why all the low ratings but I enjoyed it.
1274,"Don't believe every review, watch the movie and decide for yourself it's well made and the cinematography is really good. Expecting it to be an exact replica of the animation is stupid. There must be elements changed to make it unique."
1275,"The acting and Story are not convincing, many mnay parts are not reasonable."
1276,"If you're expecting a live action remake of the cartoon then don't watch this.If you're looking for a fun movie, with an uplifting message without any put downs, and stunning visuals that portrays the beauties of another culture then this is for you.It's wonderful to see a lead female hero who has morals, values, and puts family first. She's brave and strong - saves a country!!! - and gives little girls everywhere a role model.Luckily this sends a strong female empowerment message that doesn't tear down men, but shows how men and women can be stronger together.There is a little bit of fighting that's over the top, but have you seen the Avengers?It is PG-13 but it probably could have been PG. My kids - male and female - will all be encouraged to watch it.This isn't like the Lion King remake, it's actually entertaining."
1277,"...as it sounds like they didn't even watch this one.Pluses
It's not a musical.
A more original telling of a legend
Not whitewashed
The acting was superb although I think Jet Li could have had a bigger part than the Emperor
Easy to understand story with good plot pacing
It's not a carbon copy of the animated movieMinusesWould have preferred to watch this in a theatre
Jet Li should have had a better part.As for being a cash grab..hardly. No one is forcing you to buy it. It will be free to watch on Disney+ with your membership in a couple of months."
1278,It is a nice movie with heart touching scenes and giving honour to a woman as a warrior. Forget about all low ratings and watch for yourself. I don't know then why they talk about woman rights when they dislike such a nice movie with full of actions like Tai Chi and battles of arrows and swords.
1279,"If you wanted an identical remake of the original, go watch the original. I have 2 girls, 4 and 6 years old and an 11 year old son that all loved it. No there's no dragon. Yes, it's more serious than the cartoon. It's designed for a wide audience, not just kids, and the fact that it's rated PG-13 should give people a clue it's not really made for small children. There is almost no blood, but lots of fighting. Good messages, great visual. I am baffled by the hate."
1280,"I really recommend it, it's excellent, from the beginning to the end."
1281,Idk why people are complaining about it. Nothing will ever be like the original. But i really enjoyed it. So did the whole group i was with
1282,"Of all Disney's live actions I'm glad they did a retelling that was, if slightly, more true to Chinese mythos.
If taken as its on story (as you must like with the Harry Potter films and other retellings) this movie is excellent.
The storyline could have been a little longer and it does feel like a little was skipped over (lots of cuts from the film I'm sure to bring its length down) but it still conveys the story in the emotional and passionate manner I've come to expect of some of Disney's greats.
I'd do a more in-depth review but alas I tend to ramble. So...
I'd rather have a different telling in a ""re-make"" than the same telling performed in a different manner or on a different canvas. So like all opinions, mine is biased to my own perspectives.
This movie is more for parents and older families who can grasp the subtle and not so subtle messages and loyalties that exhibit themselves in families with strong relationships.
Well done Disney! Well done to all the people who made this film what it is!
Any movie that can move you on an emotional level is a good movie worth keeping."
1283,I find these reviews funny. I just watched the movies with the family and they loved it. We watch movies to be entertained. I don't take the time to dissect a movie and critique it harshly. Who has time for that? Are some of these people paid to criticize movies or do they have nothing better to do? Lol! Get the movie for the kids and grab some popcorn.
1284,I hope people could watch the show and appreciate how great is the movie without bringing any political mindset into it.
1285,"It's a shame this movie has had such bad reviews. Perhaps the special effects weren't up to Disney's par, or maybe the dialogue did seem out of place at times, but the story held 'true'. Mulan's strength of character is not what's in-between her legs (as most movies would have you believe) but rather her heart. That's what makes a great hero. Who they are on the inside. With all that said, they did a great job portraying that. Could they done a bit better writing more fluid dialogue? Yes. Was the effects mind blowing, in my opinion no. But the character development and story more than made up for it. Best Disney remake yet."
1286,"Let's face it, we all expected a live action from Mulan (although no one asked for them), I think it is necessary that this version be valued for what it is, a version of the poem / legend and not of the animated movie as such, maybe some characters are missing or the songs would have been necessary, but its instrumental version of these remains, it is OBVIOUS that it was made to be shown in cinemas, and that electronic devices can limit the experience and interaction that one has with the movie, there is a scene or two that although they took things a bit far to the point of looking unrealistic (like Mulan chasing a chicken and then ""fly"" through the air) , the cinematography is beautiful, it has too many well achieved shots, and I think we are all here for it, I did not feel the empowerment that the animated version left me except for 2 scenes, but yeah, i don't think it should get the hate it's getting, everyone did a good job, it's just the fact that paying $ 30 to watch it on streaming isn't worth it, but let's be empathic, it was to recover the budget, the quarantine left many businesses in ruins and it limit our experience of enjoying a movie on a big screen and a good sound, it is what is missed the most."
1287,"I really enjoyed this film. 1998 Mulan is an all time favorite of mine, but I wasn't expecting that here. This story in live action format had to be done in the serious tone it was and I'm glad the decisions to not include the music, comedy, and Mushu were made. In all honesty if it had been done to mirror the animated film the way previous ones have I probably only would've watched it at the request of my children, but instead I was the one making the request to sit with me and enjoy the film. People need to stop with the ""it ruined my childhood"" and ""they only did it to make a woke film."" Not sure how something from 2020 changed your memories of 1998 and how being accepting of equality is bad, but I pity you for how closed your mind is."
1288,"Beautiful cinematography, i love the soundtrack and empowerment of women, but the acting could be better"
1289,"If you're expecting a shot for shot remake like the Lion King, and go in with an originalist purist thinking, you'll be disappointed. This on its own was fantastic. It shows a girl who grows up to become a woman not afraid to show who she is. ""There is no courage without fear"", and that's what they set out to do with this movie. I watched it for what it was, a movie adapted to a new generation with a live action make over. The fight scenes were remnants of classic Chinese martial art style and the story did take a while to move in parts, but what movie doesn't take that route. Visually stunning. Great cast and enjoyable for a family night or a bit of new age nostalgia you know. A grain of rice can tip the scale, just watch and don't judge harshly."
1290,"Even though it doesn't really follow the original Disney movie (though there's definitely some allusions and nods to the animated film) I still really enjoyed the film in and of itself. Beautiful setting, great CGI and a lot of action. It felt a lot like a fantasy cdrama!"
1291,"There are some parts of the story can be told better, such as why the witch would die for Mulan; why the match maker made a soft scream when Mulan was rewarded in the end; why Mulan would voluntarily expose her gender in front of other soldiers, in the animated version she fainted because of injury, then was found out while curing, which would make more sense.As a Chinese I felt very misleading was the concept of 'Chi'. It made the success of Mulan Due to her super power which changed the whole core of the story.Overall I think this movie will be liked by kids. Adults will find the story obviously not making sense in a few places.Yet I still gave this movie 9 stars for this movie is nicely made and it would create some laughter during this pandemic.Something I didn't expect, yesterday I watched this movie with some US friends, and today we watched the 1998 animated Mulan movie. I personally like the animated one more, while just now they were telling me that they prefer the real person one lol"
1292,"I don't understand all the negativity in other reviews. I mean, it wasn't high art, but it's a Disney movie...so who expects that? We really enjoyed it. Sure, you can poke holes in it. But, if you can look past some flaws it's entertaining with likeable characters. I didn't see the original...so I can't compare the two. Maybe that's why we found it so good."
1293,Great choreography. Stayed true to Disneys Mulan. Had a couple legends in this movie. Great cast! If you are a true Disney fan and grew up on martial arts movies this movie will be great.
1294,Where are the songs we have sung from the animation Mulan over the years and the Disney charm of what sets them apart from other movie studios. Great action movie void of Disney Magic.
1295,"I liked Disney remakes. They were good, but Mulan was the worst. I feel like some scenes are missing. Like when she went up the mountain, it felt like she arrived too quickly. And why does she have a sister? The animated movie was way better."
1296,"My MULAN REVIEW (pros & cons)
(Minor spoilers)
Film: 7/10PROS:
1. The cinematography of the film is really beautiful, the scenes and colors are great and really feels true to the beauty of China. For anyone who is familiar with the China pavilion at Epcot in Disneyworld, you definitely get that vibe as well! Lots of reds and yellows in the film, you can tell it was meant to be in theaters.2. The characters are likeable in this film, especially some of the boys who she has to train and live with while she's an undercover soldier. Mulan herself isn't bad although she is on the quiet side, she has a sweet relationship with her father and really values family much like the original. Villains are also interesting and different than the original, but in a good way.3. Different added element in the story about Mulan. In the original, Mulan goes to fight alongside the soldiers and does know much about sword fighting or training whatsoever, which isn't realistic considering how fast she becomes an amazing fighter, in the new Mulan however her upbringing is similar but not really, she isn't quite clueless. She makes different decisions but in a good way. You have to watch it, it's makes more sense for the story.4. Without giving anything away there are also things they obviously added to the story and about Mulan and her family that are really nice, some things that would have been awesome if they were in the original. They pay homepage to the original in cool, creative and great ways too. One point my family all went ""HEY!!"" and pointed at the screen during the film (but I won't give it away).CONS:
1. Yes, it's not a musical and there's no Mushu. Some of the fantastic things you love about the original are not there unfortunately. They tried to fill in those blanks by doing other things but it still would of been much better if they had at least added one of the two.2. Mulan has a different personality. While it may make more sense for the story and culture it felt weird that Mulan was so quiet! In the original she is extroverted, argumentative, and sometimes silly at times, but in this one she's very much of a serious girl who loves her family and loves her culture and her kingdom. While her personality change isn't bad, it felt like the casting may not have been quite on point.3. Not on the same scale as some of the other live action remakes. The new Beauty and the Beast and the new Maleficent were 8/10s for me, but this one wasn't quite there. Close but not quite. The plot of the film was different than the original although they kind of are all getting that way, it didn't feel as strong.4. Things from the original are not there. Without pointing out each thing there are several elements and scenes that the original had that this does not. A big character Shang is not in this one but is replaced with an older (more age realistic) general while a soldier that is Mulan's equal befriends her. Even though the difference in the male character's military title isn't bad, Shang is such a cool character in the film and it's a real shame he wasn't there.It still is a good movie. Could they have done better? Yes but it wasn't a fail. I think the director was trying to make a Wonder Woman type character which I am all for, but because it strayed from the original happier version, it wasn't an 8 or above for me. Mulan is still awesome though, and she is still my favorite Disney princess, or should I say warrior ⛩."
1297,"It's great to see a family movie with this much artistry. The cinematography is beautiful. The use of symmetry and stylized, clutter free shot design ads a disciplined framework around the characters who play out a story about heart, courage, and family. The story adaptation should be counted as it's own achievement, not as an insult to the animated release. I personally love the affirmation of a father's love along Mulan's journey from her own father, through the regiment commander, and up to the emperor.
Add all this to the locations, sets, costumes and wicked cool fight choreography, and you've got an entertaining and emotional film. One star knocked off because my sons miss the song and dance routines. :-)"
1298,"Since Mulan was one of my favorite Disney movies, I was excited to see this movie. I didn't mind the new story twist but it is really really badly executed. I am also deeply shocked and disappointed with the script and acting. The actors seems to be reading from screens with little expressions and emotions there and the script is so shallow and cheesy to say the least. It seems they did work alot on the costumes and all but a total fail in delivering the story."
1299,"We understand that the movie is based on Disney's interpretation of Mulan and not the real Chinese story, however anyone with Mandarin background watching this movie is deemed to get bad cringes. The history here is so off, while Mulan is from approx 420 AD, she somehow lives in a Hakka style rural dwelling called Fujian Tulou that existed only 1000 years later. It's as awkward as portraying King Arthur living in the Buckingham Palace."
1300,It's a mediocre remake. It's okay but nothing more. Certainly not worth the price and has nothing on the original. Anyone who wants to complain about comparing the original to the remake and say it's not fair to do so we'll I disagree respectfully.
1301,"Some scenes were too cheesy, hard to watch. They weren't convincing. Great cast, but disappointing movie."
1302,"Mulan seems to be an extension of Aladdin from the perspective of feminism. Princess Jasmine does not want to be speechless, while Mulan took a step further to go onto the battlefield as a woman, instead of disguised as a man. Mulan put feminism into practice after Aladdin served as a beacon.The low mark on the review is mainly because people are looking for Disney in Mulan, but Disney gives us a story of Mulan.The supporting characters may be flat, but this is a good movie with good messages."
1303,"Niki Caro was not the right director for this film. She's known for dramatic fare but even still, the characters and their relationships were severely underdeveloped. When it came to action, Caro should have been wiser than to try to emulate a master such as Zhang Yimou. The obvious homage of Mulan's fight scenes to the superior Chinese director becomes very unflattering to Caro's take when comparison is made.The leads were mostly solid to serviceable, but Liu Yifei was perfectly cast. She needed to be the heart of this film and she really was. I had hoped she would be given an opportunity to show a little more range though. Jason Scott Lee was given too little to do as well, a sad continuation of a theme throughout his career.Some of the scenery was wonderful but again Caro made odd choices, keeping the final climactic set piece small-scale. The scope of the cinematography in and around what should have been an epic showdown instead felt very stunted, tight, and closed in. The camera work, along with the choreography, left the final climax feeling bereft of power. The sequence also came off as rather hurried, failing to allow sufficient time for the audience to go along for the ride. A lot of films these days don't strongly established geography within a scene and this final showdown scene was no exception.The movie is perfectly watchable but won't leave you wowed like Disney's animated version did."
1304,"I really Hate Disney, But i like Mulan
Changing Theme of Live action Movies is VERY VERY VERY Good Step taken by Disney,
NO songs NO copy paste (entirely different approach)
I saw women empowerment in movie, (Courage, sens of humor, smart)
best things in movie character built (A girl want to be warrior), Father- Daughter relation(every scene of those your eyes will melt if you have heart) , Honest with Patriotism.
i don't like ending Fight very small and very Rush into story if it has 30 min more to explain things bit more understandable, but ok"
1305,"I'm surprised by how many people that seem to think that Mulan is a Disney invented character like Mickey Mouse. This film is accused by many reviewers of spoiling the Mulan story but the 1998 Mulan film from Disney is actually the one strayed from the original Mulan legend .... but no one complained then. So please stop whining and enjoy the film for the artistry that it is. In no way is this a bad film. It's well acted, well cast and well filmed. And just to be clear - I love the -98 version but apart from the same high-level story-line, this is a different movie altogether. I am really surprised that many reviewers can't make that distinction. This no cartoon, It's a live action movie. Not all films are targeting kids and teenagers and this movie is clearly targeting a more mature audience."
1306,"Granted, it looked amazing. The film cost 100 million dollars to make, a mere token of Disney's exuberant wealth - If it didn't look good something would be terribly wrong. What irks me about this remake is just how boring it is. If I was a kid watching this I would've fallen asleep. All the charisma and charm has been stripped and replace with sluggish dialogue and drawn out scenes. The biggest change that is baffling is to me is Mulan having super powers, which only isolates audience members because she is no longer relatable. In the animation she was clumsy but she was smart and determined, and the empowerment came from her transformation as a character from beginning to end. Just watch the animation, show your kids the original. You'll both enjoy it far more."
1307,"Loved this film,so it's not like the original,it doesn't have singing in it(thankgod) no talking animals too,just a strong woman.theres always haters"
1308,"I'll start by saying The original Mulan is my favorite character AND Disney movie of all time.Coming into this movie I told myself it would be extremely different and would be more ""inspired by"" than a re telling of the original like all the other Disney live actions.I totally respect Disney's decision to leave out mushu, the music. Etc. It made sense. But honestly, I still really missed it.I thought overall the movie was excellent and definitely worth paying the premium price.I personally would've changed a few things and wasn't totally and completely satisfied with the ending, but I still really enjoyed it. It was exciting to have such an epic story come to life. The theater would've been amazing!"
1309,"Sure, the movie isn't a shot by shot remake but it was pretty good. The music composers did a fantastic job, Liu Yifei was amazing and the dialogue wasn't as cringey as i thought it would be, i walked into the movie with high hopes and came out impressed and suprised. The movie is great imo. Give it a chance and see for yourself."
1310,"As a Kiwi I watched this for the promise of NZ scenery and the feel good factor. Immediately, this film announced itself as promoting a feminist hero role. The PC stereotypes are heavy handed - not very credible but for the 'Chi"" magic.. If you understand this work as a piece in the larger subversion of (traditional) Communist Chinese values, then you can appreciate it's value. There is this emotive appeal to family honour and protecting the Emperor. The cinematography is good, though I'd prefer some less wide aperture on the scenic backgrounds. The lighting is good. Sound is good. Has quality production values. Overall, almost predictable story line, but well executed and entertaining. I suspect a bunch of the negative ratings on this film have come from CCP NPCs."
1311,"Entertaining, like the differences they made in the movie. Loved opening scene. Missed the musical elements that help make the animated one great. Budget of 200 million understand the $30 cost. Would have spent more going to the theater. Plus can watch again."
1312,"Mulan has been done on a number of occasions, this brings nothing new to it and indeed is inferior to others.This one is far, far better.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1308138/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_18"
1313,"No spoilers here.. only this is worth mentioning.
Mulan 2020 was one of those productions where costume designers insisted on having washing machines churning away at full blast.
Apart form those perfectly bright outfits without the tiniest of imperfection, Mulan 2020 was a good show. Mulan was fearless, selfless, powerful, unrestrained & extremely hot once she let her hair down.
I'm a Mongol, our warrior women (eg: Khutulun) were quite undefeated powerhouses in war therefore I appreciated the show. Family & being who you are are the top take-home values. Balances of heaven & hell combined to make good story telling."
1314,"So sad to see Disney ruin yet another classic. Visually satisfying but this movie had nothing going for it, no humour, no heart, no struggle or development. Every character changes their entire belief on a whim... amazing actors were reduced to robots delivering lines on cue, and the fights weren't even exciting to watch."
1315,I think movie is great story is good. Direction is great. It was editing choices that made kt look loke something is missing.Overall enjoyed with my family.
1316,"I am not sure what people were expecting but given how many awful movies are out there these days, this movie is definitely not deserving of this very low average score, interesting to see how many polarising opinions leave it at what it isMy wife and I were engaged and enjoying the scenery, music, and costumes from the start to finish. Was it a bit fantastic and cheesy of course it was but this is Disney. I never felt bored and we enjoyed it, just don't take it so seriously and enjoy the ride."
1317,"When I started watching this movie I did compare it to the cartoon which I loved. I was a little put off initially that they were going to stray from the original, but once I moved past that I loved it. It is a more mature take on the story and the actors and director did an outstanding job at conveying alot of the subtlety of Chinese culture. It's definitely a movie I will watch with my children when they are old enough. I do wish a few of the other characters had a bit more development, but otherwise it's a great movie and worth a watch."
1318,"Those who want to watch this movie should know Mulan 2020 is not really the live action adaptation of the Disney cartoon. This version is closer to the original Chinese legend especially in the theme (i.e. filial piety and devotion to family). This movie is not bad, but it is not amazing. The biggest problem with the movie is the editing, the film just feels a little choppy. Otherwise the casts were pretty good, and cinematography was good looking, and it was entertaining. Is it worth paying 30 bux? I guess if you have a family then it is worth it because it is cheaper than going to the cinema. However, I do think this kind of movie should be seen on a big screen in the cinema."
1319,"Well, Disney does it again! I was pretty excited for this and yes, it's a dissapointment, especially who love the original Mulan.Here's what I actually like about the movie: This movie is visually spectacular, there were many great visuals during the fighting scenes and all. The pacing was fine. The action sequences were neat yet sometimes hard to watch due to the high frame rate. I also like the effort they put to ""try"" and make it look different from the animated version by adding new substances and deleting every comedic aspect of the original.Here's what I didn't like: The characterisation in this movie was terrible. Mulan had little to no character development in the movie and again they didn't give the villains much more personality. The acting was stiff, you couldn't feel any emotions from them sadly and, I actually didn't feel anything while watching it. They tried to make it look serious but, it ended up discarding everything that made the original soo good and replaced it with nothing. The cgi looked messy at places too.In conclusion, Mulan(2020) is a disappointment. It was a colourful and action packed ride with nothing memorable and they tried to show more of the Chinese culture than the other. I won't prefer this for a rewatch and those who are fans of Mulan or a general movie goer, try it out, Maybe you'll like it more than I did.Is this the worst Disney remake? No"
1320,A really wonderful remake with reasonable plot and nice lead performance. Mulan is the symbol of heroine in my childhood.
1321,"The production of this movie was great, but where it fails for me is the battle scenes. I think they could of done better in the way the battle scenes played out. The scenes didn't benefit the rest of the movie that much. The way the big battle scenes played out seemed almost like the director wasn't sure how to put it together and it ended up poor. This was the time for Mulan to really show what a warrior she was and I just think the director missed the mark at this part of the movie. Also some characters where not portrayed as good as they could of been like the witch, there was more time spent on us seeing the developing friendships with Mulan's warrior friends then really brining out the evil character leaders and the good leaders and allowing us to really see believable characters, back stories etc. Maybe Disney was having trouble deciding if this was an action movie, teen drama, family, etc., and also it seemed like they weren't sure just how deep they wanted to go with the fighting and killing. Maybe all my issues with the movie were caused by bad editing?"
1322,"I was quite disappointed by the movie, considering I expected a lot more fun, spontaneous tenderness and more realistic acting. Throughout its duration, my feelings/ interest on intensity gamut in a scale 1- 10 did not exceed (with the exception of lady hawk's last scene) the 3-4 score. It was totally flat! You feel no depth in the characters, you do not connect to them in any level. The main actress is pretty, but she carries something very American-like in her manner, and gives the impression of being disconnected to the true depth of Chinese culture. The bows, the greetings etc. are far more shallow than they should be. Considering the era and that it's a woman meeting the emperor, she should not even dare to face him, and certainly not speak for so long in the end. People back then had numerous etiquette rules to avoid being disrespectful and to honour the person they interacted with, ESPECIALLY when talking to their superior. Chinese and Japanese cultures have held their values incredibly high throughout the centuries, they are a very crucial part of their culture and personal identity. In the movie I do not see Mulan bow to her father or showing the deep respect he is entitled to. Her sister is way too expressive, considering her screams and enthusiasm. In most Asian cultures, expressing negative emotions was considered very rude and unpolite, and women learned from a young age to act with silence, respect, and humility, moving slowly and gracefully, being seen but not heard. Ok, it's a Disney film, I get that, but it's supposed (according to the directors) to be true to Chinese culture, which it didn't manage to do very well. I liked the costumes and rich colours very much, and the fact that their haircuts resembled a bit the cartoon's. I also appreciated the fact they honoured the subject and hired Chinese actors and not Korean or other. Finally, I must say I would've preferred the directors to have changed the language to Chinese (since they all spoke it) to make it more historically accurate or, if that wasn't possible, to at least have used an older way of speaking in English, (e.g. Thus, thy, and that kind of style) to portray the movie in a past time. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I would advise you to see it just to form an opinion by yourself, but don't make it a priority. The cartoon was way more fascinating."
1323,I love this movie and has happy ending. Hopefully has the second one in the future.
1324,"Like the title of this review reads I was very disappointed by this version of the ballad of Mulan, the addition of the element of chi turns the film into a ridiculous mess of fighting sequences that defy the laws of physics and take you out of the experience.There are some welcome changes and the performance from Liu Yifei is as strong as it can be, she's a star but the main issue is that the animated movie feels more realistic and the scenes straight out of the animated movie feel so goofy and out of place in this live action take."
1325,"It did not live up to my expectations. Not all bad, but not great. Editing is lazy and the film is a bit clunky. There were some funny moments, however I'm not sure if they were paying homage to the older martial arts films or not, but they had those scenes where everyone is laughing way too hard at lame jokes. Which I didn't mind, I thought it kind of funny.There were no real surprises. It was typical and predictable. They had an array of interesting characters that were completely wasted.Children will no doubt enjoy it."
1326,"The story is not the original, with poor re-writing the play, don't waste your time and money!"
1327,"I was looking forward to this movie, Great actors and the hope was there but alas I was left feeling like something was missing. I was not wowed by the characters and the fighting scenes felt like they needed more. It started off ok and I was enjoying it than it felt flat and stale is it because i was expecting too much after this long dry spells of nothing much happening with movies. Mind you I will watch it a couple more times to see if i missed anything and When it comes out on 4K i may even buy a copy just to add it to my movie collection. Great viewing everyone and hope you get some enjoyment from the movie."
1328,"Excellent movie. Dont expect to see the original animated movie!
I thought that this live action interpretation for the original movie is great.
Unlike the other disney live action adaptations this was different and refreshing. I very much liked the adaptations for beauty and the beast and the lion king but they were almost exactly the same and frankly i prefer the originals.
The changes from the original movie complimented the live action movie in the best way. The character building was just enough that i could relate to mulan and her relationship with her friends and family.
Nothing in the movie overcast the main issues which are girl power and family.
Great effects, great acting, great production
You should definitely see it!"
1329,"Nothing ever beats the originals, but they did a good job and the actors were great. Another great family movie by Disney. Yifei Liu is a star!"
1330,"Not smooth at all, all though it has some nice vibrant colours that's not enough to distract from a lack of quality. No emotional connection to characters, and no character development. Just read the rest of views."
1331,Star Wars reboot the way it was supposed to be. Don't trust the bad reviews. Plus there's no singing ;)
1332,"I mean almost all the characters had different names, the flow of the story was chanhed. Same context, different execution from the original movie way back 1998. The fighting scenes were great, I give them thaf but as a fan of Disney movies even before, you'll definitely be disappointed on how they executed Mulan this time. I mean, even the famous song ""Reflection"" wasn't in the movie which btw the highlight of it. And the scene where she had to cut off her hair that has all the meaning of Mulan's character, was still nowhere to be found. Also, why add a witch where in the 1998 movie, only Shan Yu was the enemy there, no magic, no witch, just him and his army. If you're curious on how did they bring Mulan to life, go ahead watch it, but DON'T GET YOU HOPE'S UP."
1333,"Disney misled the audience with its marketing campaign, therefore all the outrage caused by mismatched expectations is justified. Unlike Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast which indeed were faithful re-creations of the original, Mulan is a failed re-imagining with a different story, different characters, different settings and basically different everything. To add insult to injury, Disney introduced ""super powers,"" like WTF?The biggest problem is perhaps the tone of the movie, what is it supposed to be? A charming mix of comedy, action, drama and musical like the original? Nope, this Mulan is pathetically trying to be a market-tested Marvel superhero blockbuster. It's doomed from the beginning.I think the great cast has been completely wasted, but the portrayal of ancient China is quite interesting, the intriguing but I'm sure not at all historically correct costumes, beautiful architecture and scenery made an otherwise terrible movie visually stunning, but these are about the only nice things I could say about Mulan.All in all, a lot of wasted potential here, this is what always happens when every decision is made corporate executives with MBAs rather than actual filmmakers."
1334,"This is the best of the Disney live action remakes: it honors the beloved nostalgia amd excels at being its own thing, unlike The Lion King (2019) for example.I totally understand that most folks that despise this movie do that either because there's no Mushu, it's not a musical like the previous one, or because of the lead actress' political comment that one time. So while I decided to view this with caution, I tried to be open-minded.
And, boy, did it pay off.
On its own merit, it's got some of the most amazing action sequences and stunning visuals. There was humor in the places I was not expecting. Right from the first scene, I loved Mulan and her family.
It honors its Chinese cultural roots, emphasising her love and respect for her family, despite her defiance because of that love.As this is a spoilery review, I'll delve into the bits that worried people.
NO MUSHU: Mushu wouldn't have fit in this movie, and it really didn't need him. His characterization was, reportedly, unlike the culture would have preferred. Instead we've got the Phoenix who, while not comedic, adds colour.NO SONGS: We don't watch Braveheart or Schindler's List for the songs, do we? Still, songs like ""Make a Man out of You"", ""Reflection"", ""A Girl worth fighting for"" and the matchmaker song are referenced in musical cues and some of the dialogue. The animated and live action media are very different, and they harnessed on its strengths here.-CRICKET: We got Cricket, alright, and his innocence and humor fits into the story quite well. I loved his reinvention as a supposedly 'lucky' recruit who grows in the movie.
It's not the animated movie: Once yoi can get over that part, you'll be glad it's not.To be honest there are SO many moments that were translated into live action here in ways that brought something new, with humor and heart grounded within this movie and not just rooted in the animated version we know (cough, Lion King, cough).Other winning points are the battle scenes, a surprise redemptive arc for a villain, and the elegant older cast, especially that one dignified cameo of Ming Na, our first Mulan, as she presents Liu's Mulan to the Emperor. It said so much about Asian representation and the weight of this movie as a moment for them.Now it would be unfair to not mention my demerits.
First, I felt some emotional beats at the beginning were a bit rushed. But the deeper I got into the movie I got to appreciate the subtly of Liu's emoting and to know the characters better. Once the movie got into its element, it just kept getting better.
Second ... oh wait, I can't think of a second. It was that good!Finally, I love the fact that we have both versions of the story to enjoy. Once you get past the fact that this is not the other version, and that it's made with the Chinese culture and audience in mind, you'll appreciate the movie for what it is: An Excellent tribute to the animated movie and a Soaring live action Chinese movie.
Like we accepted Parasite, perhaps we can also be accepting of other forms of cinema and let them be what they were made to be."
1335,Greatest movie ever made!!! All the actors did amazing and the movie itself was a work of art
1336,"I had seriously high hopes for this movie. I grew up with the animated version of Mulan, and I thought this movie would live up to it or even surpass it. But man was I completely disappointed. The story was clunky. There was little to no character development. The acting was almost bland. The only high notes of this movie were Donnie Yen's sword skills, the fight choreography, the cinematography, and the costume design. If you're looking for visually appealing, this is for you. If you expect coherent storytelling, skip it."
1337,"I Dislike When People Compare The Mulan Live Action Movie To The Original Animated Movie There Two Totally Different Movies.I Thought The Cinematography Was Absolutely Astounding,The Characters Where Amazing And The Special Effects Where Great."
1338,"It's a Disney movie. As expected you'll get a family friendly movie, minus the songs. There are no songs in this movie. Story of Mulan is well known. While bringing a live action adaptation of an iconic character, the main focus should've been to stay true to original. Movie is half an hour longer than the original, which made the movie kind of slow and bought nothing new. An important character who made the animated movie fun is missing, instead you can see a phoenix. There are some good moments but most of the movie are forgettable. There are two Antagonist, both lifeless and forgettable. No showdown in the End. What's funny is the person who can shift shape and bring terror to anyone had a change of heart from a 2 min speech. The one who captured all the outposts without much effort fails against a girl, who have not even finished the training!There is very little action. Final showdown I disappointing. May be they did not get enough time to do more set pieces. Directing is average not exceptional. Additional effects made the movie watchable. Lot of wirework which is not integrated properly and sometimes the giant leaps look weird/ funny.Cinematography is amazing at parts. Especially in the beginning. Some of the CGI are amazingly blended and some are clearly noticeable. Still, with weak direction, it's the cinematography that makes this movie watchable. Set design is okay, there are no scenes where set looks dirty or like people have been living there for long. Incredibly clean and looks like a drama set with a lot of clolors. It sure does make the movie look good but there is no originality considering peoples have been living there for generations and the place looks incredibly clean like it was painted yesterday. No cobwebs, no dust, no dirt. In every scene soldier's armor is clean. Even in the training scenes or after a fight, may be they had anti dust coating, I don't know. There are few short action scenes with less blood even after stabbing and getting mutilated. May be they wanted to keep the movie family friendly. The whole movie is filled with clean sets and costumes!!!!!!For me Music is an important factor while watching movies. Compared to other Disney movies, bit underwhelming but manageable. No songs!! Even the End credit song was average.Yifei Liu as Mulan gave an incredible performance. Rest of the supporting cast performed well but none of them are memorable due to weak screenplay. Li Gong and Jason Scott Lee as Antagonists looked menacing in the beginning since they had a strong introduction. But was handled poorly and in the end they were both forgettable. That I'd say is due to script since the whole focus was on Mulan alone. Jet Li as emperor even though for a short period and Cast of Mulan's entire Family was good. In fact they're the only characters that'll stay with you after the movie. Donnie Yen had few good lines and less action scenes.Overall, what I can say is Mulan is very much like the original, but lengthy and dragging without any memorable scenes. Is it worth the 30$? Strong NO. But, filled with beautiful colors and with Yifei's incredible performance as Mulan, worth a watch. With a beautiful and talented actress to play as Mulan, this could've been Disney's Wonder Woman."
1339,Loved it go watch then decide don't go with bad reviews.
1340,"2020.3.27to 2020.9.04i watched THE movie at once because it is THE first asia princesness and THE chinese story famous chinese story.
i enjoyed THE movie Liuyifei acted as THE mulan in my heart.THE love between mulan and father made me tears up.THE gongfu of Liuyifeiis very hood.i think she THE best choice of mulan .she is mulan.i hope there will be series movies of mulan."
1341,"I just want to say visually breathtaking, great performance of the leading actress. It's such an adult film and it finally says that to be a woman you don't have to be a certain way but you have to be yourself and express your femininity the way you feel is right for you. The theme of support from men is really strong and I love that we finally see this in a movie. It's such a wonderful film!"
1342,Not as great as the original but still a fantastic movie!! Well done Disney!
1343,It's fun and well produced. great for family watching together.
1344,"Every character was one dimensional. When there were scenes of tension, trying to manipulate the audience to care about someone or the plot, they fail because we as an audience do not care about the people we're watching.I just didn't care about the characters and there was no tension; no one had a clear motivation or rather, their motivation was bland and uninteresting. Everyone was forgettable instead of Mulan because that's the title of the film. The movie gave little to none scenes in order to flesh out the characters; they tried but failed at giving everyone their unique characteristics and a reason on why they're together as ""friends"". Stated once more, I just didn't care about who I was watching due to said reasoning. On another note, almost everything was poorly executed such as the editing, use of camera movement during action scenes and dialogue scenes, the script, CGI, acting, and the overall plot. Most of the actions scenes were quickly cut. And for a film involving Donnie Yen and Jet Li (although they're fairly old now) they were extremely under utilized for any action scenes. For action of itself, there was no long takes or even 5 second take to give the actions scenes any impact or any importance. Also, the use of slow-motion during the fight scenes were tiresome after the first time in use. Onto another subject, personally, I would've enjoyed if the dialogue were to be presented in Chinese (pardon for my ignorance for not knowing the correct phrasing for the Chinese dialect) in order to give that authenticity due to movie being live action with heavy Eastern-Asia influences. The themes the movie tried to explore were poorly executed and not impactful at all.Something that I can give credit where credit is due is the use of the abundant extras, set designs, clothing, and how the movie wasn't a shot for shot remake similar to the original movie.Overall the movie felt like is was just marking checks into the check box. I felt no passion or care while watching. I can acknowledge that they at least tried but every attempt in order to be different or add something new to the table fails in every attempt."
1345,"Mulan's live-action version is a little different from the animated version. The graphics and soundtracks are really spectacular. The spirit they convey about loyal brave and true is also commmendable. Not bad and deserve to see the movie. Take the movie seriously, you will enjoy it."
1346,"Quality performance, action, & cinematography hold together a sturdy retelling of the classic folk tale. This Mulan is compelling and her counterpart, the sorceress, is a welcome foil. Charming performances by the younger actors supported by nice turns by veterans. Not a controversial film by any means but also not crippled by traditionalism. Altogether a fun mix of fantasy and action."
1347,"The fairest thing, when it comes to judging, would be to divide Mulan's review in two: Mulan as a stand-alone movie, and Mulan as a remake.As a stand-alone movie, Mulan was a pretty mixed bag. The landscapes are beautiful, the soundtrack, great, and it provides a lot of interesting, new ideas, which sadly weren't executed in the best way, being the villains a prime example of this.However, emotion-wise, the movie felt very flat. I blame it on the lack of characterization of Mulan and other protagonists, and the poor script, that included very forced dialogues with grandiloquent sentences but very little substance. There is barely any chemistry between characters and most of the pivotal moments in the movie came up as dull. Mulan, both the movie and character, are void of any emotions. That, added to the pacing problems, makes this movie feel rushed.As a remake, it's not really a good one. Mulan is a completely different character here, and a lot of the values she represented in the animated movie are not present here. Far less complex than her animated counterpart, Yifei's Mulan doesn't really ""feel"" like Mulan at all. And I'd say that Caro is guilty of a sin as old as time when it comes to empowered female characters: the concept that a strong woman is a badass woman with no flaws.In short: a mixed stand-alone film with flaws and redeeming points, a bad remake that does not really capture the magic and spirit of the animated one. Not worth the $30 imo."
1348,"Great framed shots. Costume and makup is on full display but thats about all this film has going for it. This movie is void of any humor one would expect in a family film. Memerable songs there are none. In vast contrast to the original. But even on its own merit, this movie does not stand up. There is very little interaction with fellow soldiers to make believing a strong bond was built between them and Mulan. The way the soldiers and Captain come to entrusting Mulan is laughably absurd. Overall not worth the money spent to take the family to theaters to watch but for a movie to watch at home okay."
1349,"The worst Disney movie I've ever seen. It's actually not good. Terrible acting and a pointless ""reimagining"" of the classic animated Mulan movie we all love combine to deliver a lackluster film. I'm shocked at how bad it was"
1350,"Omg excellent one and it make me cry. If i have the opportunity to watch this on big screen i will.
I will recommend"
1351,"I was worried with all the bad reviews but I think it is because people are upset it isn't exactly like the animated movie from our youth. I thought it was great! It was an action movie with good acting, amazing cinematography, and nods to the original movie and songs. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!"
1352,"I have been waiting for the movie for a long time, so I read many reviews before I watch it personally. I was so surprised that the reviews are polarized. And now after watched it, I feel myself do not have a definite appraisal of it. The movie is not flawless. You can feel it, Disney stove to balance the movie to fit both kids and adults. And as a adult, the plot is not fluent enough and sometimes clumsy to me. But it also has virtues. I am so pleased with the background music and those beautiful scenes.I saw many reviews with one or two points complaining about no dragon and cricket in the movie. I have to say that is not fair. 2020 MULAN is re-telling of the MULAN story, not a cosplay of the 1998 animation. I would recommend everyone watch the movie with an open mind, that would give you better experience.Score 8 comes from the pros and cons mentioned above and my personal love for the casting =)"
1353,"The acting, the scenery and the story are all excellent. If you have high expectations that this will be like the cartoon you will be disappointed. I found it highly enjoyable and had zero expectations. I was disappointed that there was no singing but it was still a great movie. Don't listen to the hate. The people who dislike it are the ones who wanted an exact Copy of the cartoon. It's just not and that's okay. Look at beauty and the beast. Emma Watson and the auto tuned killed that movie. Glad they did not take that route with Mulan."
1354,The spectacular Waitaki New Zealand scenery is the 'icing on the cake' of a rich and moving film that many children (and adults) will likely watch multiple times. Niki Caro is a superb Director. Wonderful entertainment (and well worth the ticket - you'd pay the same as this as a couple to watch in the cinema). At least with Disney+ you get to watch it as many times as you wish. - Disney does it again :)
1355,"The pros: very well casted, visually stunning cinematography, beautiful sets and costumes, all the potential was there.The cons: it moved too quick, there were a lot of assumptions we had to make, the childhood scene and narrative wasn't my favorite, and the most important thing that was missing is it didn't harness the warrior spirit that Mulan had, it made her magical and gifted from the beginning. She wasn't suppose to be like a Jedi. What I loved was that originally she was clumsy, a disgrace, screwed things up, and she transforms into a warrior later and we get to witness that triumphant transformation. The Matchmaker scene and her decision to leave should have been more nostalgic, even if they did a couple cash-grab scenes I think people would have preferred a bigger nod to those. It wouldn't have killed them to add more musical instrumental to the songs too.Overall it was good, but not epic the way I was hoping to see. I wanted to love it and didn't."
1356,"Beautifully shot, visually stunning, bold, heartwarming, and different."
1357,"Was super excited for this remake, as I had come to enjoy most of the Disney animated movie remakes thus far. This one was by far the worst and the most cringe-worthy.Creative twists are welcome in remakes, whether it's eliminating characters, changing villains, and taking a different take on what truly makes someone a good warrior. However, many of the creative differences that were written for Mulan were odd and sometimes very unwarranted.Beyond changing a lot of story line- which is fine if you look at it as a different movie than the animated version- the fight sequences were absolutely atrocious and cringe-worthy, and directed terribly.I enjoyed the casting, and small scenes that alluded to the animated version. Chinese culture was barely prevalent, but when it was highlighted, it was beautiful."
1358,"First and foremost let's remember this is a Disney movie meant for kids and their parents - so any complaints of it ""not having enough depth"" is just complete nonsense. If that's what you're looking for, check out movies from TIFF, Sundance, etcThis movie is a live action of heroine our daughters loved, and the female director (love this fact alone!) took the opportunity to expand and modernize this heroine to heights she deserved - in my opinion, she knocked it out of the park.My girls are now 15 and 18 and they loved this version - what more can Disney ask for???? I imagine is the best accolade to the director, cast and crew that one could ask when making a live action film from a classic loved movie.BRAVO to female direction and BRAVO to Disney for more empowering messages to our girls. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"
1359,"I haven't seen the original animated version but this is an excellent movie. I see there are the usual detractors on here crying greedy Disney (although I note you all rushed out to see it on day one) and there are those bemoaning the changes from the original which is fair comment, especially when you hold the original so dear, however this certainly doesn't make this version a 1/10 when you consider the basic premise is the same, the costumes, fight scenes, the scenery......2 hours of good, solid entertainment. Loved it and highly recommend."
1360,"This movie is beautiful to watch, great action scenes, and a nice adaptation of the story. It isn't a musical. It isn't a comedy, but if you can just sit back and appreciate it for what it is and don't get hung up on the differences with the animated film, you will love it."
1361,"I appreciate that Disney takes a more serious approach with Mulan and not a shot-for-shot musical remake. It's a solid movie, but it doesn't have much to offer. The messaging is fairly simple. While this film isn't bad by any means, it doesn't excel at anything. It's a very average film that you will watch once and never really feel the need to revisit. The animated version is far superior. My only real complaint with this film is the way they handled Mulan. Bringing in the magical ""chi"" element made her a sort of ""chosen one""; as a result, she doesn't face much conflict throughout the film and doesn't really grow as a character. It would have been better to not include this chi and, rather, have Mulan achieve her caliber of strength and power through hard work as opposed to some magical element. All in all, it's a basic Disney remake that I will forget about in an hour. Doesn't do anything wrong, but it doesn't really do anything great."
1362,"Lead actress got no expression on her face. Not so ever.. not single emotion is been communicated to audience.
Rest of the movie and cast is awesome. But the lead being mojaor contributer the movie has to face damage."
1363,"This movie is not for kids.Cons:
1. There is a lack of dialogue and conversations.
2. There is a lack of Character Development.Because of this, you just don't care about the characters.
They need to build the characters personalities more.
It is like one of those War Movies, where all you see is Action and No Talking.
This hurts the movie a lot.3. Some of the fighting is very lacking.
They have so many famous martial artist actors in the movie.
They should have used them to enhance the movie.
Add more Action. Add more Fighting Choreography.
Some of the fighting was way too Simplistic.Pros:
The Cinematography was pretty good.
They really capture the environment and scenery, better than many movies."
1364,"Where's Mushu?Definitely, a different take of Mulan and a good movie. It's not animated and it doesn't follow the animated storyline to the T. Nonetheless, the movie does have a lot of different takes of the storyline. I didn't expect it to be like this but I still enjoyed the movie.With that said, this movie reminds me of Chinese movies with a Disney twist."
1365,"The act is ok, the portraits of Mulan as a woman soldier who does not accept her fate like normal women. I have to say it is hard to remake something as good as the previous, but they tried.
Some scenes are just too deliberately, it just not flows very well. And the ironic/funny thing is how all bad guys die do not really make sense.Overall, I give 7.0, not too bad but not good either...."
1366,"Honestly could've used the songs. Sat down with my son, nephews, and nieces.... They all agreed. But it was a well made action movie and I liked it. I liked the new story line, could have kept mushu. Should have waited, still hoping that money keeps getting me access to exclusive content"
1367,No mushu no musical but still a new movie. It's a different genera too. People are being to hard on it because they want to see the same cartoon remade. It's different. It's pretty good. Great to watch with the family. Some aspects could have been more developed. Some dragged on to much. Over all great family movie night.
1368,"Mulan is one of my favorite movies. I have been waiting for the live remake since years ago. Unfortunately, the release date has been postponed due to the pandemic, but I got to watch it finally. It is EPIC! All the waiting is worthy now.The cartoon version has been very popular, while in the live version the director did a more mature and realistic retelling based on the historical legend of Mulan, instead of a lazy copy. That's exactly what I expect. As I grow up from a little girl, I look forward to deeper and more inspiring understanding of the character and spirit of Mulan.LoyalBraveTrue is the motto of Mulan and also the theme of the movie. My blood boiled witnessing the transition of Mulan from a little girl to a qualified soldier. It wasn't an easy and smooth one. When Mulan left her family and joined the army, her idea was to take her father's place. After overcoming all the difficulty and self-doubt, she finally followed her heart and found her own place. I really appreciate the meticulous depiction of Mulan's growth, and the actress perfectly embodied the strength and grace of Mulan.I am also deeply touched by the graceful dynamic between Mulan and Father. ""I am blessed with two daughters"" is my favorite line. It is the love, trust and support from Mulan's family that encouraged her to fight.In the end, I will not spend too much time talking about the fantastic cinematography, exhilarating action scenes and stunning visual effects, as I am not an expert. The only word I can remember is COOL!I believe Mulan is going to be a role model for everyone, not just girls. Follow you heart and be strong, you will bring honor to us all."
1369,After reading so many whiners complaining I was hesitant but decided to watch and so glad we did! Excellent movie true to the spirit of Mulan in every way.
1370,I loved it! I Personally liked what Disney chose to do with this version. Great adaptation!
1371,"MULAN WAS FRICKIN PHENOMENAL!!!!!! PHE. NO. ME. NAL!!!!The $30 (split between friends) was worth every single penny and I'm probably going to watch this again and again until I've memorized the entire script. 😭😭😭10 OUT OF 10.As someone who lives and breathes music, I liked this live action version of Mulan (without the singing) MUCH better than the original! There was an additional level of realism and ""humanity"" without the singing. Hard to explain, but once you watch...you'll understand.As someone who also loves fantasy in films, there were still fantastical elements incorporated within the movie that blew my mind. Which leads me to the scenery and the costumes and the underlying score itself...all BREATHTAKING.As someone who LOVES martial arts and swordsmanship, this film had me audibly shook almost the entire duration of the film. Seriously. The fighting sequences and stunts were everything and kept the movie super engaging.I loved how much more closely it resembled the original Legend of Mulan. Even with the ""new"" plots added...this is Disney's best live action adaptation of a film and I'm just really happy about it.It's super disappointing to see so many negative reviews. Makes me wonder how we could have been watching the same film. Mom-relatable characters? Bad writing? That's rubbish. There were still very funny parts in this. For people that says the movie was too ""woke""...seriously WHAT?! The original Mulan was the exact same way!"
1372,"Not sure why some ratings are so low, either people was expecting a musical or are just boycotting the movie for political reasons. As a fan from the original my expectations were high but realistic, I knew the movie was not going to include the wonderful songs from the original and that the story was going to be slightly different. I didn't like some of the editing and some parts of the movie are not important to the main story. The main plot is good, a little closer to the Ballad of Mulan, the acting is okay, the score is amazing as well as the soundtrack and the scenography. Good movie to watch at home with the family."
1373,"Do NOT watch the Mulan live action expecting it to mirror the animated version as the Beauty and the Beast live action did.
It's the same base story/legend but told in a more culturally traditional & serious way. No singing, no comedy. More like a classic martial arts/action movie.
Absolutely AMAZING movie nonetheless and I absolutely loved it! I only wish they used more of the original song in the background instead of replaying the same song several times."
1374,"I loved every bit of this movie. The Witch, the stunts, the bird imagery. The cinematography. The acting. They nailed the pacing. Director Caro did a great job. Acting was subtle, not too overdone. Only criticism is it didn't need the narration, and should have been rated PG, not PG-13. Would watch it again in a heartbeat."
1375,"Though, I may not agree with the title actress's political stance, I do know how to rate a film, objectively. I'll keep it simple: well-acted, beautifully-shot."
1376,I've watched it multiple times with my daughter.It's beautifully shot with wonderful action scene and stunning scenery. We admired the splendor of the mountain.
1377,"This is probably the best ever live action film Disney could make. My greatest respect to Niki Caro. Without her this wouldn't have been possible. Yiefi is the best mulan. I also loved Yoson an as honghui. This film contains great characters and emotions. The score deserves oscar. The film is so good that I can watch it everyday . If this film had a traditional theatrical release, it could gross more than 1 billion dollars in the box office. The production design and vfx were great. You don't get to see such an epic everyday. Mulan is the most promising character of all time as she is LOYAL , BRAVE AND TRUE."
1378,I have no idea what everyone is complaining about and expected? I loved the original Mulan its one of my favorites. But I went into this with a clear mind as Disney said that it was a completely different take before it got released. And me and my family came away extremely impressed and can see why Disney said alot of the things on the original would not work. All I can say is they kept alot of the story about 85-90% intact and changed some things and I really liked it. Just my opinion but I would not go into it thinking of the cartoon.
1379,"I agree Disney created some bad apples and doubtful remakes. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. It retells the Mulan Story in a deeper almost spiritual way, and is not at all boring or over the top and rather full of nuances and subtle in a message that does inspire not only women and girls but everyone from the 21 century. My immediate thought is that this might be much closer to the original Mulan story, and is not just a remake of a funny and classic but very Americanized animated version the 1998 Version was.
So everybody who expects another round of little annoying dragons trying to get around the problem to make foot massages to elderly ancestors might be disappointed. But if you want to see a movie with amazing pictures, a deep and inspiring story and a great time the family (including my 9 year old daughter) this is your movie."
1380,"I don't know why the movie earn low rating, with everything put in order, it score my eight point ratings due to well cinematography, goog directing and highly recommend script. Actors cast a well talent acting. The story is attention catching, and it's very entertaining. The movie is marverlous."
1381,"For people who are not overly and obsessively attached to the anime version - like most or all of those who give terrible reviews it seems - this is a great take on the legend of Mulan.
Cinematography, costumes and sets are really great, I loved the end credits which are especially beautiful, and most of the actors are very good, the lead most of all.
Great entertainment."
1382,It's alright.... not great.... It is a bit cheesy but has some heart to it. I would say that it is worth a watch if you like the original film.
1383,"Good actress, lovely movie.
Mulan deserves better rate!"
1384,"To start things off, this is not a perfect movie and is not as significant as the original but it is a much better live-action remake than last years Aladdin, Lion King, and Lady and the Tramp. I had mixed feelings before watching this after hearing about the changes between the original Mulan and how it was going to be much more serious and lacked any of the best supporting characters. But I actually was intrigued with Mulan 2020!The cinematography is beautiful and the lighting is immaculate. It's also not strictly serious, this actually witty and goofy at times and structured the same balance between dramatic and comedic moments for an action movie just like the original Mulan. Another thing compared to the original is that both versions had me emotional sometimes as well. They also didn't do a shot-for-shot remake and actually had moments of scenes where they filmed their own scene instead of just copying it from its predecessor.What throws me off about this remake is that it slides off the grid for its maturity and realism because some (not all) of the stunts look comical as if I was watching a Marvel movie's fight scene. And when Disney was trying to be respectful to the Chinese culture I wished that the whole cast spoke Chinese instead of English. Another thing is that the action scenes feel rushed and too fast-paced. Sometimes the acting threw me off because sometimes some of the characters sound like they're just reciting lines instead of acting how their characters need to feel.With that being said, I completely understand how this is divisive but I don't interpret Mulan as a bad remake! I do wish Disney would stop remaking movies we've already seen however"
1385,Forget the naysayers! This is a beautiful film. It's a human film. This is not the cartoon version you expect nor should is it meant to be. Go into watching this with an open mind. I'm happy they did this movie.
1386,"Mulan is a new Disney live action film from a animated film that many people hold dear,but since im not a big fan of a original film i was able to see some solid and good staff in this film.Cast did a good job,our lead as Mulan was fine but she lacked more depth and motivation for me so i would root for her,but she in acting segment give a good job.Story removed some staff from a animated version but i didnt miss it a lot,only famous song I will make a man out of you was a mistake and they should have left it in.Mushu wasnt a interesting character to me in a animated film,so i didnt really care that he isnt here.Battle scenes were somewhat pretty looking and impressive but they lacked emotional depth.Mulan was a better live action film then the recent one but it still feels plastic and money grab"
1387,"I am unsure why so many negative reviews, my Family and myself love the film. And yes, we all watched the original as well. I loved the imagry and message to the movie. I found it to be powerful and kept my attention the whole movie."
1388,"I've always loved the story of Mulan. The Disney cartoon adaption was ok, it's a 'classic' after all. I loved the 2009 Chinese live action movie and I enjoyed this one version just as much!"
1389,Nice movie i enjoy it so much...I dont know how people do i lot of complain
1390,Now I know not to trust all reviews on this app. It appears that people had certain agendas when they reviewed this movie. I'm not sure what their agenda was but obviously it was not to review this movie. I watched the movie and thought it was awesome. It followed a storyline that Disney reimagined. If you're looking for a movie that follows the exact cartoon this is not it but obviously that's not what Disney was looking for. Some movies are set for both adults and kids alike. This movie was set for adults the cartoon was set for kids. The individuals who gave this movie a bad review was obviously a kid back when the cartoon was first released. They were looking for the same experience that the cartoon gave. This movie follows the life of a female struggling in a male dominant society. It shows women that regardless of bias and prejudice they too can follow a successful path. It gives hope to young women to move forward in their dreams regardless of the struggles they may face. That is the message that they are trying to get across. That was the message that Mulan the cartoon was trying to get across. This is the message that was given to us today in this movie. We lose sight of the message because we want an emotional experience given to us by our childhood. That's not what this movie is for. It's to encourage women and to move forward in our society and move past our biases.
1391,"This movie has symbolism that selfish people will not understand. It shows the heart of a warrior that risks everything for the sake of her father, her family and her country. Not only that, it's risk against all odds and reason for the time period. Yes, it has some magical elements that aren't reality, but it's a Disney movie for cryin out loud.
It's got beautiful elements of the Joan of Arc story by how she feels a calling and uses her gifts appropriately, even though it's totally forbidden for time period. And even David and Goliath from the Bible, where a undersized, seemingly weaker person fearlessly stares evil in the face and stays the course until the evil is gone.
Also, the use of the Phoenix bird is a perfect add-in that provides hope and shows a ""Spirit lead"" (for the Christians reading this) in some of the darkest and most powerful moments.
It's not exactly the same as the cartoon, but I thought it made it more appropriate for a teenager or adult to watch and the kids can still watch the cartoon version.
I don't rate a ten for many movies, but this one was convicting and encouraging to the warrior spirit inside that's wants to see evil defeated at every turn."
1392,"Come on, its a Disney movie not a documentary the did not dishonor or ""shame"" any of the chinese culture... its an awesome made movie of course with some flaws... but lean back and enjoy...."
1393,"I'm surprised this movie is came from disny
One of the worst movies i ever seen
Don't waste your time"
1394,"This is a good movie. Well made and very pretty. People rate it like it was on par with Starship Troopers 2 - it's a good, enjoyable action movie."
1395,"I ""listened"" to the movie instead of watching it. 5 minutes into the movie, I could tell the lead character had a weak disposition as a warrior. She just didn't have that ""spirit"" to embody Mulan.Although they made up for the colorful production setting, the dialogues are ""meh"". Regardless of the special effects, even the background actors didn't have the authenticity of the characters they were playing."
1396,"Alright, it starts off with a whole new feel, it takes a different path from the original and I love what they've done. We had the loveable original and now we have Mulan in a tale we once knew, yet it fresh, the magick of this world is beautiful, and the Phoenix was stunning, I may not be the best reviewer, yet I will admit when a moive deserves more praise, they spent alot of time to make this movie as visually stunning and story driven as possible- I hope for a second one, just to see how they develop the world. And the music, might have been missed- yet I feel if they suddenly burst out in song may have felt odd in this world- do you just start bursting into song? I liked it was different, and not trying to replay each scene as they once did, as other moives have done and just didn't fit.So rambling over,
10 stars for a beautiful moive."
1397,"So I almost Remember al the Disney movies from my childhood But the old mulan mmm I didn't realy remember
I watched this one with my 2 daughters 5&9
We liked it
A really nice movie
For them and me"
1398,"CHINESE MULAN IS 1000 times better then DISNEY version and this is SADa few years back chinese made a version of MULAN , excelent movie then another one , 2 of them but only the first movie was good and that movie still stands as the best MULAN movie ever madebefore or afther watching disney version watch the chinese version and you will see what pile of TRASH Disney made and it should be no surprise afther they destroyed STAR WARSMulan is a movie about gender-bender coming to age in the ancient China and sacrifice and emotions and the reality of war and combat on the battlefield, Disney has none of that and is : PUFF HERE IS SOME TRASH FOR YOU TO WATCH , LET CALL IT MULAN BECAUSE WE ALREADY MADE DE STAR WARS PUPU"
1399,"You have to NOT compare this movie to the original. It is it's own movie entirely. Once you do that, you can appreciate it for what it is. It's got beautiful cinematography, and the story is quite good. Don't listen to the negative nancies on here, give it a try."
1400,"I've seen some Chinese movies. This movie is quite the same, following the same pattern of ""love your king unconditional"" and ""you're always guilty, no matter what you've achieved"" and lots of self criticism which is very much questionable for me personally. How is this related to Disney? I really don't think this kinds of thoughts should be learned by children.
The original Mulan animation was great. This looks like a terrible try to copy!"
1401,So i had to stop watching after 4 mins in because of how stupid and far this is from anything about mulan!
1402,"This had the opportunity to be amazing, they should've listened to all of the uproar when the script leaked and other aspects leaked years ago. This definitely isn't ""true to the heart"" of the original."
1403,"This movie is really bad, and whoever played Mulan did terrible with her B-class acting. Why would they even publish this? This movie is not worth watching even if it's free."
1404,"The original Mulan movie is one of my favorites. When it was announced that Disney was trying to make a more ""culturally and historically accurate"" version of the movie, I was excited! But this movie, unfortunately, does not deliver on any of those promises. The inaccuracies may fly over the heads of audiences who are not Chinese, but anyone who is familiar with the culture and history of China will find the errors glaring and unforgivable. I mean did they not hire any experts in Chinese history to advise on anything??? Costumes, architecture, swords, even hair, are ALL inaccurate to the period and just Han Chinese culture in general. I know this is for American audiences, but then why claim to care so much about ""cultural accuracy""???In addition to this, the editing is so incredibly jarring and choppy. Several times in the movie characters seemingly teleport from one area to another. The pacing is very poor as well, with some parts dragging on for too long and some parts glossed over in just a few seconds.Overall, disappointing."
1405,"Worth the wait..the money...the tears. Honestly the best Disney live action movie. This is the Mulan movie I have been dreaming for. Great action, acting (Liu Yifei is better than expected), directing, visuals and music. We all should give it a chance."
1406,"If you're a woman, you must watch this movie!
If you're a man loves action hero movies, you must watch this movie!
If you're a boy or a girl, this is an excellent inspirational movie, you must watch this movie!"
1407,I did not see the cartoon until AFTER this movie. I thought it was sooooo much better than the cartoon version. Beautiful movie that have excellent cinematography and storyline. Just because you have a love for the original cartoon should not take away from this masterpiece!!
1408,"Fantastic story, exceptional cast, and wonderful CG cinematic world building. Absolutely fabulous production! Outstandinding flick! Cheers! Loved it!"
1409,"Mulan herself is a legendary heroine based on The Ballad of Mulan that was written by a Chinese poet around 380 AD. There have been many adaptions of this ballad. Just like there have been many adaptions of stories written by Hans Christian Andersen and the Grimm Brothers, most have been animated by Disney.I loved how the focus of the movie was on Mulan. It's her origin story. Liu Yifei, Mulan, did majority of her own stunts! I liked how it showed the backstory of her martial art talents and how it conflicted her. Those of Asian background can understand and strongly relate to the self conflict she experienced of what is right and being true to oneself. The song Reflection takes on a deeper meaning after knowing Mulan struggles. I loved how it emphasized chinese culture; chi, phoenix, wardrobe, etc. Stop comparing live action disney movies to the animation disney movies. Just watch it as it is."
1410,"Watching Mulan (2020) made me want to watch Mulan (1998). I kept trying to separate this remake from the animated version, but it kept using music and lines that reminded me why I liked the 1998 musical. This new version features some beautiful visuals and exciting action sequences, even if the story isn't as lighthearted or as fun as the original. As far as Disney live-action remakes go, this one isn't bad, yet it's still proof that these updated versions aren't necessary."
1411,"The movie is alright. Liu is amazing though. She looks gorgeous in this movie and I can't think of a better actor to play Mulan than her. (I have to admit that her acting is mediocre, like Emma Watson..) However, the plot is horrible. I don't know what to say about it, but it's just weird and counterintuitive. It lost the humor and excitement from the original animation. The lack of songs makes this an even bigger disappointment. Most of these Disney movies have very childish story and the only thing that lets me watch through these is the songs. Disney tried to have another way to shoot this kind of animation-adapted movies but this is unfortunately a failure. I looked forward to this movie for a long time and I have to say that I'm largely disappointed."
1412,"Just not good at all. Disney should stop making live action remakes of their classics. The soundtrack was good at times and it was made to see on the big screen with theater quality audio but none the less the story was very boring. You never feel attached to the characters and this movie does not leave you on the edge of your seat.Lastly, the whitch character really just turns good by Mulan literally just asking.....once. Dont waste your $30, wait for it to be free on Disny+."
1413,"After careful examination, I have reduced my 10, to a 5 due to discovering the unfortunate ethical issues surrounding the film and credits, and the opinions voiced by the lead role. This is a difficult film to rate due to the contemporary politics of the day, which is too loud for to be able to give it any higher than a 5**Cultural genocide in the region of filming, approval of treaty abuse by the lead star, assimilation practices over various peoples, language loss which carries capital culture.Previous review:There are plenty of adult views, as if expecting adult drama and themes, with blood and heavy action, when It' a 'PG-13', designed for children 13 years old.I also don't get the comparison of the old animated cartoon, which was an appropriation and theft of another cultures mythology, and this is for today's children.This is an excellent movie and encouragement in a patriarchal world informed by imperialist powers, of both internal and external colonialism, where women have found themselves in an unnatural hierarchy, of control, as comes with the commoditization of the natural world."
1414,"This new version of Mulan honors the original while being its own movie. It pays its respects but it takes a lot of freedom. It's understandable that Chinese people didn't like Mushu the first time around so why add him again? He is really not needed in this version. Loved it, I see Mulan as the new Wonder Woman For Disney. The director did a fabulous job."
1415,"Love the effects, Movie, editing, and most importantly acting. It is really good! All those hate comments are from new babies who don't know about the origin. Memorable movie and also love to see 2nd part, Hopefully, they focus the same story type."
1416,"4 STARSThis movie could have been better, I could not believe this was a Chinese movie. it's fast moving story, no waste of time.
They made it so sober, usually Chinese movies are filled with extravaganza and good CGI."
1417,"Before listening to those who claim the movie is bad, look at the number of people who found their review helpful. You would notice that majority of people found the reviews of those so rated this movie high helpful. That should tell you that the movie was great"
1418,Well it is not a masterpiece but it is a solid movie with good acting and nice music. Just dont go into watching thinking it will be something historic. Lets just say Disney gived their best but failed to delivery anything but a solid 7/10.
1419,"This is a real beautiful film. The acting and scenery is some of the best I've seen in a long time. I read some of the negative reviews and got choked up. My eyes literally watered up. Imagine working real hard on something, only for people to come out and criticize the heck out it. It pains me to see anything less than a 7. The ending could've used some work but the journey before that will have you talking about this film for years to come. Don't listen to the negative reviews."
1420,"I am sitting here In my living room with a tear in my eye having just finished watching a delightful new Disney version of the story of Mulan. I truly enjoyed this movie. It was fun, uplifting and exciting. For those that didn't like Mulan, I believe they are ignoring all the positives in this movie and only focusing on what they want it to be. They are not seeing what it is. Is This is a beautiful story of a woman finding her place in her family, in life and beyond. It can be an inspiration to many different people. As a father I look in my mind's eye at my own daughter, just having graduated college, leaving home and searching for her place in life. I pray that her chi in her quest to find a career and the woman inside is as strong as Mulan's."
1421,"If you're a Disney fan, this is a movie for you. Great acting, great enough cast, and a plot not bad for a beginning Disney princess movie. Listen to your heart and watch it."
1422,"Some of the reviews are very bizarre, do people not realise that Mulan in based on a traditional Chinese story.
This new movie is much closer to that original story than the cartoon musical from 20 years ago.
It's really much better than most of the reviews here suggest."
1423,"""The girl became a soldier. The soldier became a leader. And the leader became a legend.""1998 live action remake of the Disney animation movie Mulan. Although it created huge hype, I was a bit disappointed after watching it. As for the Disney franchise, this movie could have been a lot better than what they made. This does not mean that this movie is not enjoyable or worth watching. But it seems that something was missing in the story."
1424,"Mulan (2020) :
Brief Review -Packed with Action but lacked Humour and Grounding. I watched Mulan (1998) just couple of days back and then took time for this live action remake so that i could evaluate both the films on comparative level. This 2020 version of Mulan is actually little bit different from the animated flick not just in production design or apparent filmmaking but also in basic script for that matter. Mulan is more about a woman having talent since birth but not getting chance to explore it whereas the animated feature was about the Equality she was denied. Here, the girl has hidden and stupendous 'Chi' which she could not show to anyone just because she's a girl and Imperial Army is all about Male warriors while in 1998 version the girl learns the talent along with the male warriors and then bests them all. Somehow, this new film is more driven to fictional adventurous path as you might feel it difficult to connect to the Pheonix Bird angle and Witch part (at least i didn't connect). Subsequently, the humour and comedy level is almost close to Nothing i mean Zero figure, hence making it unnecessarily extended and stretched version of sweet little tale.Mulan tops in action sequences with right use of unbelievable sword and spear fights, ground battle and hand to hand combat. Niki Caro's version to Direct this action adventure feels outdated and too mainstream. In couple of action scenes the link between 2 scenes, ground reality of the stunt and intellegence in execution is missing. Thankfully she emerges to win the emotional quotient with things like family bonding, love, gender equality etc.Performance wise, Yifei Liu, Donnie Yen, Gong Li, Jason Scott Lee, Yoson An and Jet Lee are tolerable. Too much of village and imperial culture irritates at several occassions therefore taking the main essence away from the storyline. Overall, Mulan is like any other Average entertainer in today's time and if you wish to relieve compromised nostalgia of Disney then give it a watch. But of you Live the same nostalgia then watch the original again that has more humour, gags and simplicity.RATING - 5/10*By - #samthebestest"
1425,I found this movie very entertaining and visually stunning. Great action scenes and beautiful scenery is what makes this movie good.I have a couple of negative points though.. the story did not need to change from the original and some of the old music would have enhanced this movie a lot and really helped us connect emotionally to this movie.I am a fan of the original Mulan and also love musicals and the songs in the original Mulan are so great. Not adding them in was a mistake I think.
1426,"If you enjoy movies like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and the fantastical, mystical world of Chinese acrobatic filmmaking then you will enjoy this live action interpretation of the animated movie Mulan. It was fun, beautiful to look at and inspiring to children. I will readily admit the final scene with her father albeit brief is still touching. Enjoying it with your kids, there is some mild violence due to the nature of the story."
1427,"Have to say i love disney films, except this mulan 2020. The acting and plot have not meet the standard of previous films by disney. The overall feeling is bad. The cartoon version is more attractive for general."
1428,This film is just like everything else Disney produces these days. Super-hyped character with no development at all. I don't even want to comment on the way they treated the story.
1429,"I am a big fan of disney, especially the comedy Mulan. However, this movie is not the mulan i expected. I felt totally disappointed with this movie. The movie was not bad but the main character could not represent the mulan i know from the comedy."
1430,"My kind neighbor invited me to watch Mulan on Disney streaming . After watching Mulan I was happy not to be the one who have paid for it ; though I was happy to offer a fresh cake to my neighbor for his invitation.Aside from the bad impressions left in all of us from the current global crisis at this time, I noted how hard Disney and Chinese money tried to impress the viewers of almost all types with a live remake of artificial actions, feelings and false heroism.
Has it been a Chinese Pocahontas marrying avengers, so on ?
Even for the audience who wanted to escape from daily hardships and virus scare, such Disney/Chinese marriage could not help. To glorify a chinese hero at this wrong time with a brainless movie as such is next to impossible.
Sorry for Disney; you misstepped once more and even more seriously. Perhaps this situation makes you to decide ending such awkward marriage in future."
1431,"Scene grand atmosphere, color composition is very beautiful, acting online, laugh point tears point, father and daughter line is very moved, Liu Yifei gave mulan this role into the soul! Very sad! A masterpiece in a word! Mulan is a princess who doesn't need a prince! I love her forever! I want to watch it again after watching it several times."
1432,"The story is very amazing, Action of the actors is very cool, Cinematography and visuals are very stunning and colorful. Highly recommended for fantasy movie lovers👌"
1433,Absolutely cringe. The cgi was dreadful and the characters are boring. The fights were all terrible or utterly cringe. Do not waste a cent on this.
1434,"Overall, fairly good looking movie. Watchable but no masterpiece. Acting seems mostly wooden. Most of the dialog delivered with the precision of a high school play. The SFX in many cases are of poor quality. Some scenes appear to be poorly focused. Action sequences are second rate at best."
1435,"This is a great family movie - while it is a bit slow in some places, the story is strong and the action is great. It's a very good Hero's Journey story too. Great to see a live-action version that exceeds the original so well. (No singing either, which is a bonus)."
1436,"Action, diff from animated so it was fresh & new. Even had a lil comedy. But i think the most fantastic thing how many Chinese actors & actresses they had. For it to not be a film by someone Chinese & yet hold true, wow! I mean Nina Simone, Moses, Noah w/ russell crowe, & Liz Taylor as queen sheba; just a few examples of when hollywood cast realistic demographics waaaay to the side"
1437,"Without a doubt, this was the worst live-action movie Disney has ever made. It has nothing of the magic of the original 1998 film, no comedy, the actors are not charismatic, they have no romance and no emotion. From beginning to end, this film was a real disappointment."
1438,"My first thought after seeing this movie was ""boy am I glad I didn't pay for this!"" That took the sting out of the experience. My second thought was ""the writers must have really liked Frozen!"" Seriously, did they just want to re-make Frozen? (And I love Frozen!) That might sound crazy at first, but hear me out.
1. They inexplicably gave Mulan a sister, who is barely integrated into the story at all.
2. Mulan has barely explained magical powers, and feels isolated. She is distressed over having to conceal her magic. She feels isolated within her family and community. Sound familiar?
3. It ends with Mulan embracing her sister and declaring their love for each other. Mulan does not have a traditional love interest.
Not related to Frozen, but also, what is with the inconsistent narration? And the Phoenix? So stupid! It's like the writers forgot that they added several elements to the story! They didnt seem to have any clear idea of what they wanted to do with these story elements!
I also feel like they sucked all the joy, humour, and personality out from the original movie.
The awkward pacing is one of the worst elements of this movie. There aren't enough establishing shots either. Characters just seem to appear places. I kept asking myself ""what just happened? How did they get there? What day is this supposed to be???"" I could go on, but why?
What a terrible, hollow, forgettable, disappointing experience!"
1439,"Just don't compare it to the animated version. This is a great film, don't be discouraged by the reviews . Watch it for yourself and you will enjoy . It leaves you wishing there was a Mulan 2 in the works"
1440,I liked the movie but it wasn't like the Disney movie. I felt like I watched a warrior movie in China where they spoke English. What made this not feel like Disney's Mulan is that they left out the best character... the dragon! If he would've been in it the movie would've been a way better experience in my opinion.
1441,"It's pg-13 so don't expect everything soaked in blood.. it's sure an entertainer for kids and adults but not for those who critic it so extensively . I don't know how much money was dumped and not I'm not interested to know the only fact remains is the movie was okay and was not boring..
This one doesn't deserve to be hated ."
1442,"The bandwagon low ratings.. it's not a perfect film but pretty good. Probably the best of the live action remakes so far.There are unrealistic expectations from a Disney live action at play here. Even if you don't like it, it would never be a 1 star movie. If you give this 1 star what are you gonna give the abominations that actually exist? All you do is discredit yourself doing that."
1443,"No words for this movie, I wanted to be over from the beginning. Where's the magic? Not even close to the original. Such a waste of money and time!"
1444,"It's a very Great Family movie,especially for girls.It's a movie about Loyalty,Brave and True.A girl with all the courage and a trip to find her out....Lots good GongFu designed in this movie.Very well present.
Highly recommended."
1445,"Way to go Disney! Wish I had watched it earlier. Lovely symbolism that honors Chinese culture and history. I truly appreciated all aspects! All Asian cast, colors And birds that represent Loyalty and honor and strength. Look at it with different eyes. It's not a cartoon. This is 2020. Excellent! Loved the orchestration. Wonderful! Glad to finally have a new movie during Covid."
1446,"This hurts a bit because a loved Mulan the animation version. This remake failed in every aspect of a good movie. The script was terrible! Somehow they decided to change the story and take away the relationship between Mulan and mushu, the only comic relief possible in this disaster of a movie. The cast was chosen poorly and not even hip man could save the movie. Movie full of low budget CGI and predictable green screen backgound"
1447,"It has nothing to do with the original Mulan, the story is way off. This must be the very first movie of the the director + producer. The only positive in the movie is the photography. But this was a huge was of money."
1448,"I really cant understand what all the bad reviews are about. This is a really good entertaining film, I was captivated by it right from the start. Loved the story, the characters, the acting, and the effects. And best of all there was no swearing or unnecessary sex.
Some times I think people get a little too much above themselves in thinking they are some great film critic, or maybe they just want to pull anything down that is made by Disney. At some point I will certainly watch it again."
1449,"What happened to the savage Mushu that we all loved and also made part of Mulan what is was for us? Disney had made a live action of Maleficent which slightly differed from Auroras story and told more about Maleficent but still was telling Arouras story and it stayed relevant but felt new. If you want to take liberty in trying to change things with a live action you can do so, but when you completely strip the live action and make it into something that has only the main human characters have in common with the original cartoon (except for Shang, what the hell leaving out a great guy like him!?) that is when you need to go back to the drawing board and restart it. You guys took everything we loved about Mulan and threw it away like it never existed. You need to keep things relevant and try to keep in the highest notes that made the cartoon such a success. Plus the animated was a musical the most top song that everyone knows (whether by memes or the cartoon) from this epic cartoon is making a man out of you. This movie can be compared to if you made a live action for Beauty and the Beast stripped it of its musical and loveable story and turned it into a horrifying slasher horror movie."
1450,"This movie misses the mark on so many fronts. First of all, shot in a region of China that is currently the victim of cultural genocide by the CCP. Then, completely ignores the cultural myths of ancient China. Forr example, there is no Phoenix in cultural China myth. Disney really missed out on this one, trying to appease Chinese and non-Chinese audiences."
1451,"Usually I read reviews before I watch a movie to see if it is worth it and I am glad that this time I didn't-I only read them after.I think the movie was great! I even stayed to hear the songs at the ends, that's how much I liked it. If you like this genre and realize that this is a MOVIE you'll probably like it too."
1452,It did a better job telling a Chinese centric story
1453,"I was looking forward to watching this remake when I heard that unlike some of the previous remake attempts this would not be a shot for shot remake, but instead a more realistic style film with no songs. I love the original and liked the idea of a new take on the story that brought something different.However what I got was a lifeless film that hadn't really gone for realism and felt more like a clunky superhero story. The editing was so poor I felt like I was watching a student film, there was no character that really felt memorable and the entire message of the original film had been lost by giving Mulan superpowers from birth instead of us watching her learn and push herself.A lot of the big emotional moments from the original fall flat, and there's just no fun or heart left. I'd really like to see Disney focus on coming up with more quality new stories instead of remaking every old film but worse."
1454,"Mulan 2020 is a decent live adaption from Disney, it's not the best but it certainly isn't the worst. Its fun and i enjoyed the most part of it.The introduction of a witch is ridiculous, no mushu, no cricket and Mulan has a sister?! The acting is questionable as well, those soldiers look like they don't know what the hell they were doing. Honghui look terribly awkward, everything about their acting is just totally off. The fidgt scenes look just too fake! No way!
Liu Yifei did a remarkable job on her part, Jet li was just there!Overall its a decent movie but it's miles behind the animation, if you haven't watched the animation then you'll be totally comfortable with this."
1455,"DO NOT go into this movie expecting the animated film. Most of you already know from the trailers there's no Mushu and no songs. You can tell that they're doing something different so you need to try to go into this movie with an open mind as much as you can.That being said, this movie was disappointing to me. It tries to blend the old Chinese legend of Mulan with the animated film and it doesn't work. I would've liked if they only focused on one. Even if they just made a literal live-action movie of the animated one with little changes (like Beauty and the Beast, or Aladdin), at least it would feel like a complete story. I wish they focused more on the legend so it would at least feel different and new.Most of the behind the scenes crew are non-Asian people, specifically white and it sucks that that's the case. Yes, they have an all Asian cast but I don't feel a celebration like how Crazy Rich Asians felt. I just didn't feel for the characters too much, and the writing didn't help as well. I also feel that they were a lot of things cut from this movie. There are so many moments where a scene ends abruptly, and when they go to the next one, it feels like you're in the middle of it.I could go on but the rest makes more sense once you actually watch, which I DON'T recommend. At least, don't pay $34.99 for it. It's coming to Disney+ with no extra cost on Dec 4, so I say wait until then if you really want to watch it."
1456,"I thought that since I had watched the old Mulan this won't be as entertaining but I was pleased to be disappointed. The scenery, the characters and the fight scenes were amazing. When watching a remake you feel like you know everything that's going to happen but not this time."
1457,"I know that some of you have been scrolling through comments to help yourself decide whether to watch it or not, trust me I watched it and it is not worth your time at all. Nothing but a soulless piece of supposedly movie"
1458,"How could Disney let this happen and put their name to this. Niki caro is a total disgrace. Completely ruined this Disney classic. They messed with it (you don't mess with a classic) and destroyed it of everything that made the original great!
Do not support this. Should be pulled from cinemas and writer's should start again."
1459,"Continued watching for the nice voice of the dude. Loved the amaretto sours, especially making them in the kitchen where I couldn't see or hear the movie."
1460,"Mulan is a boring, uninspired, and bland movie. It stripped the good parts of the original Mulan, and made it worse. The editing and camera shots were horrible, and the characters have no personality. And Mulan, she already has fantastic fighting abilities, so the training is entirely pointless."
1461,"I have not followed all the social media buzz, nor did I see the original animated version. I had no predisposed expectations of this movie. With an open mind and looking to enjoy a good Disney production all I can say is ""Eh"". The story was good and there were small sparks in the acting but none of it never really meshed. Backgrounds and scenery fit in well and it gave me an understanding of Chinese traditions but as for entertainment I am very happy I watched this at a relatives home. I would have been really upset paying 30 dollars to watch this on top of the annual cost if Disney+. But in the end, the stunts were over the top and unrealistic. The main character who played Mulan seemed flat and lifeless in many scenes, possibly a cultural thing and I had to push myself to watch it to the end. Not what I consider up to the normal Disney level of quality."
1462,I personly really like this version. Bold move Disney.
1463,I really loved this movie. A star-studded cast. One of my fave Disney movie. Highly recommended! Congrats Team Mulan! 10/10
1464,"I truly loved the familial love in this film. It was so moving and the cast portrayed this in such a delicate and loving way. Alongside that, It's always great to see women stand up for themselves against those who belittle them. Overall I thought It was an enjoyable watch that makes you feel a little something in your heart.The negative reviews are pretty much brought on due to politics & preset expectations that the movie is bad due to the difference between live and animated versions.Though, I feel that it bears many similarities to the animated version. What the critics missed is how they varied in certain ways. Mushu was not there in the form of dragon but in the form of a phoenix. His purpose was to look after Mulan throughout the journey after being told to do so by the ancestors, this is exactly what the phoenix did. It helped her in times of need. Phoenix & dragon go hand in hand in the Chinese culture which I think is beautiful because when combined, the movies possess the Yin and Yang. As for the Prince Charming, he appears as a friend who took the first step to stand up for Mulan when no one else did."
1465,"SOOO BEAUTIFUL! I was anticipating this movie since last year! And I can say it has really exceeded my expectations! Cinematography, acting, and action scenes were breathtaking! Mulan truly inspires me to be loyal, brave, and true. Too bad due to the pandemic I didn't get to watch this in the cinema. I hope Disney can still profit from this film. I'm now a fan of Yifei Liu and Yosan An! I love all the rising Asian actors in Hollywood!For those who are complaining about the absence of Mushu and Shang, etc., I suggest you all go feed your nostalgia and rewatch the animated film. Although I did miss the songs from the animated film, this live action has its own magic and gives Mulan a new flavor! Love love love Mulan! This is my newest favorite action film! I'm glad to see Disney explore into other genres for movies!"
1466,"This movie meant more to me than anyone will ever know. As a Filipino Chinese woman, I am proud of this story being brought to life by an all Asian cast of talented actors. This folk story dates all the way back to the HAN dynasty, it is rich in history and visually... this movie is stunning. To every woman who has ever had to face overwhelming obstacles to fight to be seen, heard and valued this movie is for you. Mulan's bravery will inspire you.Don't listen to the bashers, they are trapped in their childhood expecting childhood characters. I loved the animated version, I loved the live action also, they are different but both executed beautifully. See it for yourself, you wont be disappointed."
1467,"It doesn't hurt, it doesn't ciritisize, it doesn't question. No humor, no spirit and no heart. Fighting for an emperor with absolute power while taking one man from every family? No problem, here you go. Gone ahead and waste them so you can stay on your throne. Why do the Mongols invade? Who knows. It doesn't matter. Just fight for your ruler.Story goes like this: Foreigners (bad) are invading China and a little girl (good) fights for her great nation. That's it.Character devolpment is non existent. Except for the witch, who changes her mind just because Mulan asks her nicely.Jet Li acts like a tree stump, Donie is OK but his character stays the same for the entire movie.This movie is a boring generic attempt to cash in big in Winnie Country. It reminds me of the south park episode where the boys were censored until nothing was left.
What else :And to repeat everybody else: Where is Mushu?Waiting for the Snyder cut.....Generic and bland"
1468,"No Disney songs, no Mushu, they change the history, the actress is really bad! Even if you didn't see the original movie is not worthy! They put magic to compete against karate and guess what? Karate won! hahaha ridiculous! They put another ""heroine"" woman to enhance the speech of women power, but it is too much! and shadows Mulan's power. They whole army looks the same, any efforts on the drawings. Do not waste your time!!"
1469,"Watched it in the cinema and I was more interested in the popcorn than what was being shown on screen. After 25 minutes, I fell asleep. I don't understand why the critics love it."
1470,The plot is full of holes!The story didn't make any sense.The acting is terrible.The dialogue is really unnatural.
1471,There is also no soundtrack that Disney is good at. It is extremely ugly.
1472,"Another victim to the woke generation. God forbid we actually remake a childhood classic as enjoyable as the original. No instead we have to turn it into a cookie cutter martial arts film. Remove the fun, gut the story, add realism by taking away mushu but add a shapeshifter? Garbage don't waste your money...atleast no one was offended though right?"
1473,"Mulan is film that is very interesting at the least. The filmmakers try to take this film at a different approach than what the original Mulan fans are used to. Although different is not bad, and I very much respect the fact that they changed it up rather than creating a complete copy of the animated film, this movie is very mixed in what it does. Before I begin to really ""critique"" the film, let me explain the good elements of this film.
Right off the bat, the first I will say is that the cinematography is amazing in this film. Out of the many recent Disney remakes, this film that had one of the most visually appealing cinematography. There were so many ""WOAH"" shots that took my breath away. Even better, the colors complimented it so well and made everything feel alive. I also enjoyed the casting and overall performance from the actors. Although it was a little annoying to hear some actors with American accents and some with Chinese accents, it wasn't as big of a deal to me. Unfortunately these features were not enough to
Now onto the cons. I feel that sometimes this film doesn't know what it wants to be. It tends to avoid many of the magic elements from the animated original (the ancestors, mushu, etc.) and made it look like a historical. But then again they added other elements like chi and witches. This confused me a little bit. They made it seem like a historical-type drama in the trailers but continued with the fantasy. And if I must say so, the animated film felt much more ""historical"" than this one. I don't know much Chinese history, but this film did not convince me that they were living in a real place. As I said, I feel they didn't establish what type of film they were trying to make. It doesn't feel magical but it also doesn't feel completely gritty and real either.
Our main character Mulan also suffers from a terrible syndrome that has been seen in many other Disney films (StarWars episodes 7-9). Unfortunately Mulan suffers from the Mary Sue syndrome, which states that she is a character that is too ""perfect"". Right from the beginning young Mulan already knows everything and has it all perfect. She is a skilled fighter with great reflexes prior to even going through training. Even then, the training scene does not show herself as learning anything. It seems almost as if that scene was useless and more or less a tribute to the original film. The original film did a better job of showing the struggle she went through, being that she was a woman competing with men. If they would've fixed this, it could've saved it a little more in my opinion.
In general, this film was an enjoyable Disney film to watch with family. But as a cinema-lover myself, I can't say that I was sold on it. Images were beautiful but was not enough to save it. 5/10"
1474,"This movie hit so many different things right that it is absurd how underrated it is.
From image to script to casting, to characterisation everything was spot on.Fine, editing was sloppy and often it felt weird throughout, but that's just an awkward style, the movie is a great drama and it made me feel like no other movie has in ages!I'm saying it's 10, but because of the weird style and weird ending it's most likely a 8,2/10.Not bad!!!"
1475,"I have so many problems with this movie.They changed Mulan's reasoning to fight. The CGI is awful, fighting was unrealistic and stupid. Disney said "" we want it to be a realistic war movie"", then they add a witch that turns into a bird... save your money and time, just see the original"
1476,"I understand that the movie shouldn't be like the animated version, but come one, let's be realistic, this one as a movie is really bad. It's boring and the final sequence is poorly executed. Sometimes I didn't realised I was watching Mulan, I thought it was Kung Fusion or Shaolin Soccer with spikes. Some scenes are just cringy for me. The worst live action Disney movie yet, sadly."
1477,"It's about time Disney makes a good remake. This movie was better than the original. It was refreshing to take a break from the usual, movie ruining, nonsense characters and stories and enjoy a movie about honor."
1478,"Though visually stunning, throughout the entire movie I kept comparing it to the animated version, wishing for Li Shang to appear shirtless singing ""I'll Make A Man Out Of You."" The ending was boring and basic, I wish I didn't pay the £20 to watch it. I don't understand how this will catch a younger child's attention as it barely caught mine at 22 who grew up with the animated version."
1479,"The heart and soul of mulan has been ripped out in this dull and underwhelming remake. so disappointing. mulan (the character) has no spark and no rebellion which is in stark contrast to the fiery, strong mulan from the original. mushu's absense was heavily felt and and the disastrous attempt to change cricket into a soldier was, well, awful. li shang played an important role in the original movie, both adding interest and keeping the story flowing, so it was always going to be interesting to see how they have adapted to him not being there, and frankly, the story blows. his new ""equivalent"" fellow soldier is boring and actually quite a minor, unimportant and inconsequential character. he didn't add anything to the movie, he only reminds us of the li shang we wish was in this movie. one of the only good things that the movie brings is a new character, the eagle witch lady. she is honestly such an interesting character and really adds something to the story, but then they decide to kill her in what can only be described as the worst ending in movie history. the ending fight is so appallingly choreographed and filled with cliches. it's also so incredibly unrealistic with mulan and the emperor both possessing some inhuman power (probably to do with their chi) that allows them to catch arrows and, apparently, kick an arrow that is mid flight, and have it fly at great speed down, through the armour, and into the heart of the bad guy. ugh. a huge, huge disappointment."
1480,Every single good thing about the original is missing for this one. Completely wooden acting and unbearable editing. Cartoony Mustache twirling villain and terrible special effects. If it wasn't for the cinematography this would easily be a 1 star.
1481,This movie has nothing but some good scenery in CGI and small scenes of stunts in my opinion least they could've remade the ankle version this movie lacks everything no fun or emotion having such a big cast and legend of kungfu there was nothing impressive at least Disney could've made some other new movie very disappointed movie
1482,"""Mulan"" starts off as being funny and later switches to an action/drama movie. The problem I have with the movie are the scenes that didn't add up, some scene were too fast and we weren't given any explanation especially the fight scene with the Emperor. If you take away these unexplained scenes and some exaggerated special effects, the movie is actually okay."
1483,"Hua Mulan is a girl blessed with the gift of the Chi which offers her amazing powers. Unfortunately, she must bury her gifts and marry a suitable match in order to bring honour to her family. Northern invaders, called Rourans, march towards the Imperial City, led by Bori Kahn and a powerful witch alongside him. The emperor orders that each family provides a male warrior to fight for the kingdom. Mulan is forced to take the place of her frail father who is the only male in her family.As I do for all adapted films, I will not compare Mulan (2020) with the original animation and I will judge the film on its own right.The first act of the film was an eye-friendly watch that showed us the journey of Mulan from a child discovering her abilities to a teenager struggling with her identity and her place in society. Training in a camp of males, she must do all it takes to hide her true identity as a female and abide by the three virtues of a warrior (loyalty, bravery, and honesty). While all of these sound like solid points, the movie invested an unnecessary amount of time in achieving these, while occasionally being repetitive with its messages.Things quickly turn sour in the second act as the battle emerges. In a weird instance of solely chasing a small army of Northern Invaders, Mulan is lured into isolation with Bori Kahn's witch. Mulan establishes a connection with the witch who encourages her to come to terms with her true identity and abilities. As Mulan embraces her true self, the movie suddenly seems to run out of time as she is shown, in fast pace, to save the Imperial army and eventually the emperor in an extraordinary but cheesy fashion.Mulan (2020) is a visually stunning film for the most part, but it struggles to be anything more than ordinary as it fails to invest in providing compelling action sequences to cement its over-established plot points.5/10."
1484,There is no words to say to that will do it justice. I am speechless. Disney made a movie that truly honors the story of Mulan. I love this version so much!
1485,"Too many slow motion, close up scene, the tailer showed most of everything.Without the usual song and dance, Disney lost its charm to make a beautiful fairytale, but also not solid enough to craft something based on logic and common sense.
Need to always remind myself that is a Chinese star wars movie which hard selling some values. don't try to figure it logically."
1486,"This was an amazing depiction of a brave young woman bringing true honor to her family!! Perfectly mastered, couldn't have asked for a better remake"
1487,"There was no heroism from Mulan side, there was no excitement for the heroism. It was just a plain movie just as flat as the Great Plains. Mushu the dragon was missed in the movie. As the character could have brought much needed lightness to the movie.Mulan animated movie was much more realistic, only magical parts were about the guardians. In the movie people just climb walls by walking up and it felt unauthentic.If they just made the animated movie, To a movie this would have turned out to be a great movie.There was no love connection of Mulan or even exploited that character dynamic. The director for guardians of Galaxy or Wonder Woman director could have been better.Animated move was much better, I Just watched it... The Movie is in the bottom of the barrel."
1488,"All the people on here downing the movie need to get over themselves, no it is it the cartoon but it is worth watching and does not deserve to be destroyed. It is great in its own way!"
1489,Amazing rewrite of the 1999 movie! Though there was no songs it felt more close to the original story and was more historically accurate. The inclusion of Ming-Na Wen in the end was pretty awesome!
1490,"Mulan's martial arts action design is very good, flowing, director and actors are very good, emotional rendering is very accurate, classic re-enactment. Mulan in order to protect the country, its core, loyal, brave, true, worth advocating and learning, women can also protect the country, self-reliance and self-improvement. The song is also very good, like the movie"
1491,Great film it is just being Review bombed By salty Protesters
1492,Out of all of the Disney remakes this had so much potential to make the action better with a live action version. This took all the best parts from the original cartoon and left them out substituting in uninteresting filler. There was no real character development and outside of Mulan there aren't any characters you get to know. Skip this movie.
1493,"It is not worth the money Disney is asking.And I´m a Disney lover... Watch the animated version instead.
The sets and figurines were beautiful. There was really bad cgi and some good. The soundtrack was forgettable although there were references to the songs from the animated classic that I appreciated. I liked the fact that its a different story from the animated, unlike other Disney movies that copied the original and gave it a National Geographic twist(Lion king).But i would like to see a better growth on the main character ... Mulan´s already a incredible ""acrobat"" from the beginning of the movie. I would have like to see her SLOWLY discover how amazing of a fighter she is.
There were some but very few funny jokes and moments. The stunts and fight scenes were good I really did enjoy them...
In conclusion its far from being a great movie but i did enjoy it. Not worth the price that Disney is asking 30 something dollars is too much for the quality of this movie. I wont be watching the movie again.
Maybe if the main actress didn't support the violence that the Hong Kong police provided to its people i would enjoy the movie more ...
Sorry for my basic english"
1494,"* There is no end credit scene *The director Niki Caro and crew brought an enchanting profound adaptation. I loved this version, the differences made it feel more real and it doesn't deviate from the main course of the animated movie, a story about a woman in a man's world. Even though I loved it the storyline was not as strong as it could have been, making the film appear incomplete. There were a lot of magnificent scenes but cut short and I didn't even notice how almost a two-hour film went by in a blink of an eye. It would have been perfect if it had one more hour for more character development, fighting sequences, and mainly one of the exquisite additions the channeling of the chi needed to be explored more.I like both versions but I dare to say I prefer this one over the animated one because this film caught me off guard with so many emotions and there were scenes that tears left my eyes without notice, even remembering scenes have me teared up. What hit me hard was its main theme in which was acceptance and the perspective was not only to be accepted but to also accept oneself, to be true. It was magical how powerful this word expands beyond the story of this film, the longing to belong in such a complicated world. The weak storyline doesn't take away the spirit of the film.The composer Harry Gregson-Williams sets a magical atmosphere and his music build up the lead character's true self.The cast was phenomenal every single one, especially the lead female actor Liu Yifei. She gave life to Mulan and a whole new meaning, a performance that left me wanting more. I also have to give praise to Gong Li as the witch, I didn't expect to be so engaged with her storyline. She deserves a film as well, I would love to know more about her backstory."
1495,"I don't know why people are saying that its not like the original when they don't even know that the Disney animated movie is so far off as well They didn't ""take out Mushu"". He was never in the original story. They added him to the animation film. This movie isn't based on that, it's based on the original story."
1496,Yifei Liu is really beautiful and fits the role perfectly!! I love mulan
1497,Critics showering this with praise are wrong. I could barely get through this movie without fast forwarding. Acting is wooden all around. The lead actress looks like she's just reading off a script. The pacing is slow and the story bland. It's completely humorless with no musical song and dance. Best way to describe it is it's soulless. And the fight scenes do not redeem it either. If you've seen any of Jet Li's late 80's and early 90's movies it's intense with edge of your seat action and gorgeous fight choreography. The climactic ending battle was short and boring and frankly does not cut it in 2020. I kept thinking there would be another more exciting fight at the end but nope. Some platitudes of wisdom were uttered and then The End. On the positives the costumes and cinematography are beautiful but that alone cannot save this movie.Mulan has a similar feel to that Keanu Reeves' movie 47 Ronin which was also terrible but at least I did not fall asleep in the theater and it is a bit better than Mulan. What's surprising is this $200 million budgeted movie does not look or feel like a $200 million movie. Effort was clearly put into creating colorful visuals but the story at its core is hollow and the lack of humor robs it of the original's charm. It's too serious and the weak fight scenes and choreography just sinks this movie. No it's not worth $30. Frankly if I knew it was this bad I would not have watched it even for free.
1498,"If the idea behind Mulan 2020 was to make a more realistic and modern take, they failed horribly. They took out so many things of made the original good, that the movie is simply something else. It gave me no sense of nostalgia, no scenes were taken literally, not even the music! Nothing like how fun Aladdin was.For starters there is no way a woman could hide her period in those times. She was sleeping for months inside a tent with all the other soldiers. What would she do with the soiled cloth? Where would she procure more? How would she avoid getting soiled mid training? Really, there was no need to be such a stickler to things being realistic, because the story simply can't be told that way.By taking out the songs that said a lot about the characters throughout the movie and the fun that Mushu provided, they killed many of the scenes that really brought secondary characters into light and helped develop them. The trial she overcame in the cartoon movie required thinking, using her smarts and her newfound strength. How did she do it here? Concentrating her chi? Utter nonsense. Also, Mushu and Cricket saved her from many close calls. It made sense that she would need help hiding her identity.Why did they cheapen her love story? Her relationship growing throughout the movie was so important, and the fact that he was her officer was important as well! Where they afraid it was feminist enough? That her love interest was in a position of power above her looked bad for the press?The role of the witch felt like ti was there simply because there weren't enough relevant women. And since she couldn't be evil, she had to be a subjugated, misunderstood, powerful woman that in the end died for Mulan because she had triumphed where the elder woman had failed. Oh, come on! Why not make Mushu a female phoenix? Would have made more sense!Anyhow, it has a few touching moments, but felt overall like a bad press movement trying to update a story that worked to make it fit into a modern narrative and destroying its essence in the process."
1499,"No way as good as the cartoon version, no songs, no jokes and no facial expression from the main character as she was very wooden. It was no fun watching it, the only good part of the movie is the fight sense. Go and watch the cartoon version instead as it is way more fun and enjoyable. Paying an extra 30 dollar on top of the monthly subscription is not worth it."
1500,"OMG when the father said that line , it's really like what the hell... Phinex is a sign of the Queen, that's the Chinese believes, not a guardian. There are countless misconceptions like those .There is chi everywhere for the first half . But chi is not who just luckily born with it, even someone who is gifted needs a master to guide , to practice some secretive Gongfu.
And the make-up for Milan and the mach maker is shocking...
Apparently the olden days people do have exaggerated make up , but it is quite hilarious to see those shocking make-up. Is this a documentary ?
Story ... Oh dear , a girl who are good or talented with Kongfu , all of sudden become the leader of an army... Congratulations! Female, girl are awesome! Oh dear.Didn't even bother to finish last 30 mins."
1501,"But for the rest its a pretty good adaptation to the original adaptation of the mulan story. i do miss the small and helpfull creatures that protects mulan as a sacred service from the housegods, but allthough there are some fun parts after all.the production are full of colours, and for the mulanfreak and chinese history geek this is broilerism, fictional or not. im surprised that the makers didnt spend more money on even more spectacular cgi's and vfx, and also the use of slo-mo are vividly used for the case of extended playtime, it couldve saved them moments at normal speed, and the playtime a bit more sober especially the youngest vievers.there are quite some war scenes to watch but its not too severely violent, its more the disney violence code that lingers here. . the filmographic and editorial work are fairly good, the music has a strong input to the plots action and the actors are neither over -or underacting.having had expectations toward this film i cant say i'm disapointed as the plot is still familiar ,but its lacks the hilarious fun that the animated version brought ahead. the grumpy old man recommends"
1502,No dancing and no singing. They should remake it with dancing and singing.
1503,Mulan 2020 checks out as a movie that tries to start the film with a big volume of a story but ends up with a small one. The pacing feels ok. The screenplay looks sloppy right from the start and it also fails to redeem itself throughout the rest of the movie. The second arc tries to lift the film but doesn't add anything special at the table. If you are an OG fan of the original animated Mulan film then this Live-Action adaptation will disappoint you. Overall Mulan 2020 is a time pass movie from start to end.
1504,"If you are looking for the cartoon version... go watch that.It's good.
Judge it on it's own merits."
1505,"From the outset, the film offers a very beautiful visual spectacle and a quite remarkable storytelling style, I felt as if suddenly something bad was going to happen, I felt the feeling of sadness and agony that one feels when someone you love leaves and will probably never return. And after that, you see a combination of moments of self-improvement and spectacular action sequences. Of course, suddenly the movie has its very strange clichés and some filler people that do not transcend so much compared to others. But If I have to give ten to an actor, it is the actress Yifei Liu as Mulan, it seemed to me the best cast they could do for a young warrior who gives everything for her family. Hence Mulan is loyal, brave and true ...In conclusion, Niki Caro's Mulan is an epic, exciting film that at certain points, fails to achieve what the animated version did. But that's why you have to understand that they are very different and that everyone has their own tastes. I really liked it a lot: 8 stars out of ten I give it.P. D: probably the best I've seen during this pandemic situation."
1506,Beautiful. I like how it's different from the original but still the same
1507,"It's great! I love how realistic this movie is from a cultural point of view and this version is more empowering. While watching this new movie, it felt different but it still captivated me even without the elements that I thought would be in this movie."
1508,"This is how Disney should remake all its former animated movies. Similar story, but has different elements and parts are different from the original. Excellent movie with excellent action. Previous animated movies have been terrible, this one was awesome."
1509,"All those people reviewing this film based on their political beliefs, need to get a life. It's a movie!!!!!! Plus, I highly doubt any of those ""reviewers"" actually dished out $30 to see this film. Now as for this film, it's nothing like the cartoon which I enjoyed, it's about time they change it up. I'm tired of seeing Disney remakes with the same songs and storyline, if that's the case then I'll stick to the original. The dialogue could of been better but overall, it's a wonderful remake! Beautiful costumes and gorgeous locations. It's a bit slow in the beginning but picks up midway. It even manages to bring a tear to your eye. The kids, both girls and boys loved it."
1510,Don't believe the bad reviews... The action in store are both top notch yes it is not the cartoon version but it was never intended to be like that from the beginning so going to the movie with an open mind
1511,"Disney ruined my childhood, enough said. Bad film, avoid this."
1512,Fantastic achievement a woman becomes the supreme warrior of the Chinese Dynasty
1513,Don't pay attention to bad reviews. This was an amazing movie I absolutely Loved It!
1514,"Don't listen to the haters! Watch the movie for yourself. It's a great movie. Stunning visuals, great action scenes and decent storyline.My main gripe (and my kid's)...where are the songs?!!! My kid missed Mushu, but I kind of get why they did not put him in. They wanted a more serious film. BUT....so many scenes would have been made more dramatic or intense with a song thrown in. At the very least...the most well known and definitive song from the animated version (Reflections) should have been included. Perhaps during the moment when she decides to take her father's sword and armor to take his place in the army.I hope Disney makes a 2nd version to be released to theaters (after Covid is under control with vaccine)...and inserts the songs in it!!!!"
1515,"I had such high hopes for this movie. I knew it could not come close to the original but still. However this was just the worst way they could have gone.1. Story - when I heard they decided to take Mushu out of the picture I thought they were going on a more realistic path maybe this adaptation would be close to the actual legend, but if yotu take Mushu out so that it is more realistic than don't add a witch and not the cool kind of witch but the kind that turns into birds with terrible special effects.2. Special effects - horrible, not good at all, it looked like old chinese movies.3. Feminism - I get the subtle massage in the movies, when alongside a good script and great story they put in some inspirational thought, however this one was not executed well at all. When you have a strong well established female protagonist in the story, maybe don't force another female antagonist with the lamest story of all and the lamest ending. The character of the witch was just not needed.4. Action - boring, almost unwatchable, all the best moments taken out.Few good things:
1. The line ""I am blessed with two daughters""
2. scenery, the wide shots were amazing
3. Soundtrack, new version is coolThat's it.My advice, watch the trailer its quite good, listen to the music sound amazing, keep up the hipe, don't ruin the nostalgia."
1516,"""Mulan"" has seen a recent Chinese release as well this Western release, by Disney. The Chinese film is probably closer to the harsh realities that underline the sentiment that defines the tale. It's grim, there's lots of self sacrifice, death and blood.That said,that's not Disney's core market (at least that's my understanding) and this film reflects that fact. I'll add i don't hate the Disney film. I know there have been a lot of negative reviews but what needs to be kept in mind is the typical ""audience"" for Disney films. Families, younger viewers, so its not going to be as violent or adult orientated as other versions of this story.What it does do well is competently tell Mulan's tale in a very watchable manner. Yes its got the usual Disney bright, cheerfulness but its not overdone and the core message of sacrifice for family is front and centre.The action scenes are polished done, the cinamatic's outstanding and the acting is well above average too.So for those who want a serious, mature take on the story of Mulan, no this film may not be for you (track down the Chinese film instead). For families, younger viewers and general audiences this film is very accessible and I, for one, enjoyed it.In fact, to be honest its the first film from Disney, I've enjoyed unreservedly in quite a while.7/10."
1517,It was a great movie. I didn't want to see the same movie as the animated one. I wanted to see a more serious and action packed. If you want to watch a child's movie watch the original not this. However if you want to see a good movie. All thumbs up.
1518,"Wasn't thrilled about shelling out $30 for this, but bit the bullet and did it. Whole family watched and it was nice to be able to see something at home safely, instead of risking the theaters.Overall I found it enjoyable, and my kids loved it."
1519,I am shocked at the terrible reviews. I thoroughly enjoyed this film
1520,Very well depicted the virtue of humanity. Yifei especially did a great job!
1521,Great family movie. We are so glad that we ignored the low rate reviews. The kids enjoyed the movies very much.
1522,"I'm a first generation Asian American. I watched this with my family and other Asian older families. They actually all really enjoyed the historical accuracy of that period that Disney put into this film. How all the actors and actresses were all Asian. How we appreciate the enemy was changed from Hun to Rouran for historical accuracy. I'm glad there were no talking animals.
Though this is quite different from the cartoon, it's a really good different. Personally, I think if they just did a duplicate of the cartoon into live action, it wouldn't be appealing to me. This was realistic, believable, and full of Chinese culture, history and values. And it was still pretty entertaining.
Even the battle scenes were pretty historically accurate in displaying battle tactics."
1523,"Some of our favorite characters were left out the story line, but it was still pretty much the same movie.......minus the musical numbers and yes some of the comedy. it was also a different times and Disney is trying to be progressive/politically correct. I watched it 3 times and every time it's gotten better and more empowering"
1524,I don't get all the hate. Action sequences and martial arts were nicely done. Great actors. Great movie!
1525,"I've always loved the animated version of Mulan so I was really hoping this movie would do it justice. However something that was available from since the trailer for anyone who actually researched it ,was that this movie would not be like the animation at all, so comparisons should stop there.This movie has beautiful sceneries and amazing shots, however when it came to the story it felt like everything was rushed it seems like some shots were missing and because of that we didn't get details which disconnects the viewer from the movie .The script could've been better, don't get me wrong this movie had everything to be a classical soulful Disney movie, however because of the poorly written scripts and sometimes lack of emotion from the actors themselves the movie kinda falls flat. Despite this there are some very powerful scenes in this movie that actually gave me goosebumps and overall made me jump from my seat in excitment and absolute awe, like for example the scene where Mulan discards her armor and we hear ""Reflection"" playing on the background.I also really loved the relationahip dynamic between Mulan and Xian Lang , even though they chose different paths I liked that instead of fighting they found common ground, afterall these characters are the reflection of each other: two women with amazing strength and talent who were shunned because of their gender.Overall this movie is not a masterpiece, it lacks simplicity , some things were way too far fetched like the apperance of the phoenix who wasn't necessary yet could some kind of allusion towards Mushu, the fact that Xian Lang is a witch is completely unecessary to the actual plot and even the ""romantic relationship"" between Mulan and Hounghui is not only rushed but also completely meaningless and kinda cringey since it has no actual development and only appears in the end of the movie without any hint prior to that moment.Nevertheless it is a good movie, which exhales female power and brings a fresh perspective on main female characters giving a modern approach to an already beloved character."
1526,"This movie is beautiful
This movie is amazing one of the best live action remakes of Disney!
the movie and story are beautiful
The actress maybe a dumb ccp agent but her portrayal of Mulan is beautiful and inspiring.
This movie is a must watch I can watch it all day the ending is just so BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT"
1527,"""The girl became a soldier, the soldier became a leader, and the leader bacame a legend.""--mulan""She will be fearless,and go ahead, even in front of thousands of troops and horses.""Mulan retains the core and integrity of the original animated film, while at the same time recreating the legendary historical story.Mulan is not short of beautiful moving, exciting grand scene, there are fantastic scenery, photography, action, you can see the director's skill is very strong. In addition, director Niki doesn't ignore the character's emotion and growth. Actress Liu Yifei's solid performance brings the character to life. She is not only beautiful and elegant, but also has a unique charm. You will understand after you have seen the film. The beauty and emotion of the film were not lost because of the smaller screen, but I still want to see her on the big screen."
1528,"The original Mulan was about a women risking everything to save her father, even when she knew she wasn't ready for the army. After that, she WORKS and uses her mind over her body to solve her problems. In this movie, it doesn't have the songs or the side characters, which would have been okay if it was more realistic.. But it's not. They turned Mulan into Goku, except Goku had to train to become as strong as he did. Mulan was just born with a ton of Chi and it makes her better than everyone. There's also a magic bird lady. Yeah, the realistic one. I'm not even sure the Critics watched the movie, because it's DOG$H*T!"
1529,"Excellent film, acting and story line. It definitely isn't like the kid version, but they have advertised it this way. I watched it with my older daughter (14) and we all enjoyed it!"
1530,"The worst live Disney adaptation.
You can't relate nor sympathize with the main character, who seems to have only two faces throughout the film; focused and blank"
1531,"This movie is utterly unbearable. The fake Chinese mysticism, the ridiculous story, and the horrible acting all make this one of the worst movies I have seen all year."
1532,The only reason people hate this movie is because there are no musical numbers and this movie is different than the original.
1533,Look- I was expecting Disney Mulan the cartoon.. but in live action format. I quickly realised that this was not gonna be that dans was disappointed because the dragon is my favourite character.Ok once you realise it's not gonna be Disney cartoon style... you can actually appreciate it for what it is. A great story with some fighting scenes and some good cinema. I think the low reviews are mainly down to nostalgia not paying off. If you had never seen the cartoon you would probably like this movie.So go and watch it but let go of the original story.
1534,"I am fond of the original Mulan and when I heard that they are making a live action remake I was.. Curious? Kinda didn't want them to make one because live action remaked aren't always that great.Man, was I disappointed by this.First, they cut mushu for some reason, but then add this Phoenix as what? Replacement? And I don't want to start about this whole witchy thing that I found completely unnecessary and waste of time, is this Mulan or Harry Potter?I thought that the reveal of Mulan truth identity will be at least dramatic and like this ""oh God nooo"" moment but it. Was. The. Most. Boring. Thing, and that saying a lot for this movie.Also the whole action sequence is so unrealistic, like doing back flip on top of a horse? They made the animation looks more realistic that this one."
1535,"I watched this film with a girlfriend. She knew about this story before, I didn't. We both liked the movie!"
1536,"This is quite possibly the lowest score I've ever given a film, and I want to explain why. Given it's budget and resources, there should be high expectations out of this film, but Mulan truly doesn't meet any of them. From storytelling to acting to cinematography to costume design, this film is extremely sub-par. A lackluster, generic story with wooden acting. Costume design that looks terrible, and cinematography that is out-of-place and even had me busting out in baffled laughter (""Is this an epic tale? A superhero story? Or a Wes Anderson film?""). On top of it all, as a Chinese-American I am absolutely floored by the lack of respect to Chinese culture displayed here. Caro tells a version of the Mulan tale that goes against the very spirit of the beloved legend. It is an ignorance that is disappointing and disrespectful and pulls from the worst Orientalism has to offer. Niki Caro told a superhero story (a subpar one at that) but Mulan was originally the tale of an ordinary everywoman. I encourage you to look at AccentedCinema's native Chinese take on Mulan on YouTube."
1537,This is the best Disney princess movie we have ever seen. we have added it as our family movie night favorites.
1538,"This version of Mulan not only told the same story as it's predecessor but expanded it and made it more realistic. There are many versions of this legend and this incorporates many of them. If you were expecting a shot-for-shot remake this is not it. Boy am I glad it's not (Sorry not sorry lion king fans). I just don't see the purpose of making these remakes if they're the exact same thing. This is why Mulan, like many of the other successful titles, meets and exceeds my expectations. It still tells the story we all knew and loved, but expands not just the main character but the supporting cast in regards to their motives. The music was there, in spirit as you could hear it in the background. The characters didn't break into song, and it was intentional. It would be really weird to see an action scene with battles and killing and then just have the characters break into songs and ballads. To which I applaud the direction they went in by sticking to what the style of the movie was meant to be."
1539,I love this movie also In a description /This movie is great/
1540,"Despite its low rating on IMDB, the movie was actually fantastic. The characters were likeable, the scenery was drop dead gorgeous, the fight scenes were exciting and well choreographed, the whole movie was just enjoyable.I'm really quite surprised by the rating on here, I feel like low score reviewers were watching an entirely different movie.I highly recommend watching this one, I watched it with my youngest daughter and she too enjoyed it from start to finish. Don't believe the low rating, this movie is super enjoyable."
1541,"Everybody knows the story, many have told the story, but few have understood the story. This movie brings the whole family together... possibly even with a tear of love and joy. A must watch."
1542,"I waited for months in anticipation and excitement for this movie, knowing that many great actors/actresses are involved. But after watching, I'm not only disappointed but angry & disgusted as well.First and for all, there's already a huge damage done to this chinese period film when the movie's dialogue is in english, because the essence, the emotions and the culture are not accurately conveyed. Who says Disney movie can't be in mandarin? If their animated version can be dubbed in different languages, then who says this live-action version can't be filmed in mandarin?Second, it's really a pity Lee Ang turned down the offer for the director of this movie. I feel that Niki Caro has done a really terrible job here. She doesn't know the strength of her actors & actresses, she doesn't know how to direct them into showing the correct emotions. Many times I felt the expressions and emotions of the actors/actresses were so so weird. And she definitely does not know how to bring out & convey the essence of a chinese period drama culture. So many emotional scenes that could potentially help the movie develop into a more exciting level were sloppishly done and abruptly concluded. So many huge stars were involved, yet I feel that their talents had been wasted here.The push factor (fight scene between Gong Li and Li Yifei at the battlefield) for Mulan to reveal her real identity is so weak. The scene where Mulan tries to convince the Commander that the king is in danger is also effortless and lousy. The witch's switch of alliance is also so weird, and without proper development. The defeat of Bori Khan was so easy, like a child's play. OMG..... Did Niki Caro think that she was filming an animated film? *shake head*Third, there are 2 huge action stars in this movie (Jet Li & Donnie Yen), why is it neither of them was invited to choreograph the stunts?!? Everytime I watch the fight scenes, I get so frustrated because they made every single one of them look like an easy defeat, no development, nothing challenging & exciting at all! Yet again, a waste of great talents (Jet Li & Donnie Yen).Fourth, lousy editing! During the scene when Mulan's family were talking about her father's enlistment, the different angle shots they used were so terribly wrong! In one shot Mulan's arms were crossed, then in another shot it wasn't crossed, and the next one was crossed again! Seriously?!?Last but not least, can't they do a better job at finding the right actor for Honghui's role?!? There was no chemistry between An Yoson & Liu Yifei at all! OMG....In short, ""Just like that?"" repeatedly came into my mind throughout the whole movie.
Mulan managed to conceal her identity and blend into the army ""just like that""?
Mulan felt compelled to reveal her identity ""just like that""?
The commander and the others believed her suspicion ""just like that""?
Bori Khan and his army arrived at the Imperial City ""just like that""?
The witch suddenly betrayed Bori Khan ""just like that""?
Mulan defeated Bori Khan single-handedly without her sword ""just like that""?SLOPPISH WORK NIKI CARO! Utterly disappointed.............."
1543,"For a real life film I found it entertaining. The scenery was good, however the main arch villain was a bit of a joke. But good overcomes evil, that is what Disney is all about. I somehow wish that the side characters weren't so wooden."
1544,I like this movie it is pretty good for what it is. It is not cheesy at all.
1545,"They spend so much money on this move, but they did not even try to get to know the culture of story of Mulan"
1546,"I've always been a Diney fan, and was waiting for this live action. I wont lie, I wasn't really expecting much of this film since there wouldn't appear Mushu nor Cricket, but it was sadly worst than I tough.
To give it credit, the scenario was really beatiful, the colors were stunning, really something nice for the eye, but that's it.
The acting was bland in every character, there was no emotion transmited (not even in their voices), and even withouth songs they tried hard to get the feeling we were watching them doing the same things, in a cold way.
I really missed Mulán grandmother, it was a nice character, instead we get Mulán's sister, who doesn't stand out.
I really really wanted to enjoy this film, but was too hard to watch, the fact we don't get the ancester spirits watching over her, but we can get some weird flying witch and people who walks in walls it's nonsense. And to top it is the ""chi"" thing.
I really don't understand what were they trying to do, other Disney live action are entertaining, have songs, love, characters with development, even fight scenes that give you a little emotion, but this was the opposite. Why was this not a musical? I still wonder that.
The worst though, was the fact that our heroine didn't even had to make any effort, she just ran away and show the world her real power. It's absurd, she was the best ever just because, and doesn't make you sympathise with her because she doesn't make any effort.
It was not worth my time, I waited long to see this, and am disappointed, had to watch the original Mulán to get over this."
1547,What can I say? Predictable. Typical themes. Best fkr children this story has been retold and retold. Prefer other versions to this Disney one.
1548,"I have nothing to say other than I am deeply disappointed....
Bad casting, bad production and exaggerated fight scenes that looked straight up from a cheap Chinese movie.
After watching this I had to re-watch the original 1998's animated movie to get the bad feeling out of my chest."
1549,"I had really high hope bcuz I thought it's going to be much closer to REAL Mulan story which is not the carton one got mushu, all unrealistic things etc. As a Chinese, thats what I actually wanna watch. The trailer shows that it's much more realistic and more authentic to real Mulan story. However after I finished watching it...I'm very disappointed...not real, fine, and the phoenix is so fake, the first thing it reminded me is a kite, so 2d paper-like. Not to mention, villain turned to good side is so reluctant, no character development, so little. And the one more important thing is, want ""real"" approach then be ""real"", want ""magical"" approach then be ""magical"", don't mix both unless you know how to mix well and blend well. I'm so disappointed that I have to create an account here to comment. Acters in movie is average good, script is terrible, very terrible.
Overall it's pretty soulless and seem really weird."
1550,"I didn't want a remake faithfully scene to scene To the cartoon (like 2019's Lion King)... Since it's a live-action, I understand the fact that they don't have Mushu, and even liked the idea of a Cricket personified. But I was expecting a Disney standard action movie, and less of this exaggerated action style with poorly made special effects."
1551,"Overall, from a general movie standpoint, it is just bad. Incredibly bad acting, weak character arches, limited emotion, bad CGI, confused cinematography.... The list goes on. If anything, this seems like an equal, if not slightly worse, version of ""The Great Wall (2016)"".Besides these factors making it a bad movie in its own right, to make matters worse it has nothing to do with a Disney movie - at least they managed to remove everything that is usually associated with that franchise.1) There are no witty characters (like Mushu) that usually is integral to balance the deep emotions of Disney pictures2) There is NO SONGS, as in none. In other words, one of the clearest pillars of what makes Disney movies great was removed. This is especially egregious when considering the amazing song options in ""Reflection"" and ""I'll Make A Man Out of You"" that was available and defined the previous 98' movie.3) Instead of replacing the void of Mushu or Li Shang, they introduced new characters in the form of a witch, Xian Lang, that is a confused mix of an antagonist and a savior meant to help Mulan develop her ""abilities"". When push comes to shove, she ends up being absolutely redundant and an unnecessary addition that could have done much better by merely adapting the original characters.In sum, this is most likely the worst attempt ever of producing a good remake, or even just a movie, from the Disney studios and I hope they will be both greatly disappointed and change their approach for future. Further, I hope this will not be remembered or even associated with neither Mulan nor Disney - it is simply that bad."
1552,"I think it's official, Disney has run out of ideas. It's clearer than ever that these Disney remakes are now just constant cash grabs. In NO WAY is this movie worth $30...maybe more like $3. It changes all the wrong things making it a much lesser version of the original. At least it stays true to the message of Mulan's tale and includes some cool action scenes. But with no music, no charm, and no heart, this movie wasn't even close to capturing the magic of the original. As a remake, it sucked, and as a standalone movie separate from its predecessors, it still sucked. If you're a fan of Mulan, I would stay far, far away from this remake. Quite honestly, just rewatch the original.Score: 3 out of 10
Overall: BadRecommended for: Fans of (some) cool action scenes, maybe fans of Chinese culture, but definitely not recommended for any fans of the original Mulan."
1553,"I'm giving this a '2' because it is a truly awful film.The main actress simply can't act and a lot of the dialogue is very obviously scripted. It is impossible to lose yourself and forget that you are watching movie (if that makes sense). Disney have being going downhill for a while but this is definitely a point that it would be difficult to 'beat'. I hope they can improve going forward. Another thing about this film is that it is impossible to be on the side of the heroine (and the other 'good guys'). They appear to be moral but there are things they do that no moral person could agree with. It's certainly a very 'shiny' film but you can see quite clearly where they have copied from other, better films. The previous Mulan was disappointing but this os dismal. Avoid!"
1554,"I was excited to watch the live action version of Mulan. The animated version was a family favorite for years. This remake is nothing like the original version. This was utterly boring and literally almost put me to sleep. There are none of the great songs that Disney is known for in the animated version. Mulan has a sister. What? Magical powers? This is just nonsense. Even the action scenes in this film were boring. Not to mention all of the key characters that were completely left out of the film. Where is the relief humor from Mushoe and the rest of the army gang? Nonexistent, because they were completely excluded from the movie. This remake was terrible."
1555,"It's being respectful for the culture but every thing falls flat: the characters, the plot, the dialogues, the jokes. i did not enjoy watching it."
1556,The film's all-female behind-the-scenes team reflects the spirit of the core female perspective under the loyal brave true but also charming Liu's performance is very good it will become a girl's idol an Asian princess
1557,Great live action version of Mulan! Definitely worth a watch
1558,"They did a really good job to make it more ""realistic"" and but still keeping the key elements of the story. I grew up watching the original version again and again. And now I feel like the story as grown with me. Now, I will keep on watching both versions again and again."
1559,"I am full of meloncoly to hear that mushu was not apart of the live action mulan remake. although his character was there for comic relief in the 1998 version, the remake needed some other elements besides just fighting and other things. also WHERE IS LI SHANG AT. you can't replace an irreplaceable character."
1560,"Why do Disney make the movie when it is nothing like the cartoon version? The characters are totally different and the story is nothing like it. She cannot act, with no face expression. It's a myth movie instead of a historical advanture."
1561,"I like this movie very much, it brought me a lot of shock, touched my heart The sound effect and the picture are good The actors are great, too Likes Mulan"
1562,"Mulan is great. The thing is, everyone keeps comparing this show to the animation. They're in completely different time-frames, targeted at different audiences. If Disney wanted a complete carbon copy of the 1998 animated Mulan, they wouldn't have spent $200 million on this film. Where's the creativity in that? The variation? Just watch it as a standalone, completely new film. Trust me, you'll enjoy it much more.There are a lot of tiny details I missed the first time I watched too. It kinda feels like they wanted to squeeze the film into 2 hours, cos they kinda rushed through the plot. It was kinda hard to catch up with the plot, but watching it the second time helped a lot. Also I couldn't really sympathize with Mulan before rewatching it. I don't know, but maybe COVID kinda affected their filming or something. Only Disney can answer that.Mulan could have done with more sacrifice on her part to add that emotional touch to the film. Her ""qi"" makes her, like, way too powerful.I would also liked to have seen more relationship between Honghui and Mulan. I mean, someone who you just talked to in the dormitories and during lunchtimes definitely isn't worth risking your life for. I could tell Disney wanted to add a little romance, but not too much. Mulan dropped only 2 hints about her liking Honghui, and it would be generous to call them subtle. If they wanted to steer their relationship towards friendship, they could have done so without those hints. For the sake of not spoiling the story, I won't mention those hints here.Visuals-wise, everything is flawless. Expected from a $200 million budget film. Nothing looks fake and plasticky, and the action choreography isn't too bad either. At least Mulan doesn't glide around like a paper aeroplane. I also liked how Mulan used different types of weaponry, ranging from bow to spear to fists. It brings more life to the story, instead of her using only a sword and doing impossible stuff with it.As for the acting, the dialogue could have been more emotional and dramatic. I really liked Honghui's acting, he was able to add that realistic touch to his dialogue without losing the emotion in it. Mulan's acting wasn't bad as well, the tears at the end of the movie when she reunites with her father didn't seemed forced. The witch's dialogue overall was calm and, to be honest, flat, though it probably fitted her role as a supposedly powerful villain.I have no idea why this film got such a low rating. It definitely deserves much higher than 5.5/10."
1563,"This movie was so stunningly beautiful. I was apprehensive at first about them cutting out the music, and breaking away from Disney's version. But I respected and agreed with every decision they made. One of the best live action remakes Disney has made"
1564,"The Disney live action remakes of their classic animated movies tend to either follow the original movie shot for shot (which is basically completely pointless), like The lion king or Beauty and the Beast, or steer too far from the original (like Maleficent, and to some extent Dumbo). Mulan however manages to be both true to the original and make itself a movie of it's own. Look, nobody needs to see Mulan done exactly like it was before (just see that movie instead, it's a great one). This new version does not need to have musical numbers or Eddie Murphy's fast talk. What it needs is to stand on it's own - and it does exactly that. Yifei Liu is a fantastic Mulan and Jason Scott Lee as Böri Khan is just as menacing as Shan Yu in the animation.
Forget the negative whiners, nobody's childhood has been ruined over this movie. In fact it just may have made somebody's childhood a little bit better instead."
1565,"Part of Disney's animation-to-life-action project, Mulan tells of a young woman who pretends to be a man so she can go to war.I don't remember much of the original Mulan, except there was a humorous dragon that has been excised for this more realistic version. So this isn't a comparison review, although I recall liking the original better.There are some good things in this movie. The fight scenes are well choreographed and exciting, and famous Chinese actress Li Gong is wonderful as a complicated villainess.But there's really not much to this. There's little character depth, so while things move briskly you don't really feel like you're going anywhere. The concept of chi seems a little murky, in that only two characters seem to have much of it and there's no particularly reason for that; they're both being women seems more like a coincidence.I enjoyed this movie, and if you like a lot of running around and cool fight moments and a yin-yangy villainess then this is worth checking out, but I swear a year from now I won't remember having watched this at all."
1566,The movie is very dull and corny. One of the worst Disney movies that I have ever watched.
1567,"Re Watching the first 10 minutes of the original Mulan, is better then the entire remake. Story, there is one but it's as plane as a dictionary. Only 1 minute scene of something you can consider comedy. The target audience was a fail mix of western and anther universe of Chinese culture. The 'fighting' has constant unnecessary amount of pauses. They will stop the time or slow down the animation constantly. Don't waste money trying to watch it or your time."
1568,"I watched the cartoon Mulan when I was in primary school. It is a wonderful memory of my childhood. Yifei Liu is my favorite actress since I was a student, so it is an absolute surprise to me that she star in the film.
I love the story of Mulan and the wonderful performance of the actors in the movie."
1569,The film is very well made for families that have no male children and only have daughters who are also on the battlefields somewhere at war. Congratulations on proving that a woman can be even better than a man at everything. You got my best rating for this film.
1570,"If you have never watched any of the other Mulan movies, it's pretty ok, however I kept singing, 'I'll make a man out you' and 'a girl worth fighting for'... This movie falls flat, Bori Kan is so not scary, Disney must stop doing this to our childhood memories, where was mushu, I liked cricket though he wasn't given much screen time, as for the witch wow what a waste, I didn't understand her role, her giving up her life for Mulan made no sense whatsoever.... There are many different versions of Mulan though so in that regard this was an okayish movie... But 1998 Mulan still tops it 5000 times over"
1571,The lead actor is good but the plot had a number of cheesy moments.
1572,The cinematography of the movie is good for being a live action version of mulan. That being said there's tons of aspect ratios that are off in th majority of that battle scenes that are just terrible. The movie isn't captivating by any means. Disney movies are suppose to be tear jerkers and sadly this was not.
1573,"Same fake and depressing arguing the whole way through, like any other modern movie. No improv allowed. Only cliche lines and acting tough or acting pretty. If they're not arguing or acting tough, they're saying how much of a victim they are. Film makers who think the only emotions that should exist are in the Karpman Drama Triangle shouldn't be allowed near a movie set.The Karpman Drama Triangle is for when people are at the end of their wits. There's no creativity in it - just people yelling as a hero/victim/villain. Yet film makers only use these angles like a robot making food, then have the audacity to call it art."
1574,"I love how they did not include all of the elements of the animation and put something new. Else, I would just watch the old cartoon. With being entertain in mind, I gave this an 8. There are some things that are missing but not enough to make me hate it."
1575,"This was my favorite live-action film. The characters were great and the action was great too. This movie was a real tear-jerker towards the end. There was a lot of emotion and dedication put into this movie. All the other people are hating on it because they want it to be an exact copy of the animated cartoon version. I believe this film surpassed the cartoon version and the special effects were really good. Overall, this film deserves a 10/10 easily. Even though it was short, usually these live-action Disney films don't last that long. Lastly, the battle scenes were pretty sick not gonna lie."
1576,"Gong Li, Jet Li and the other actors could have made this a great movie. Unfortunately, the movie dialogue scrip was beyond help! They were shallow, even dump."
1577,"""Mulan"" is an Action - Adventure movie in which we watch a young woman disguises herself as a male warrior in order to be part of the Imperial Army at her father's place. She has to pretend to be a man because no woman are allowed in the army.Since I have already watched and liked the animation movie I have to admit that I had high expectations from this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the result because there were many unnecessary changes in the movie in comparison with the animation that I found them very bad. Another thing that I did not like was that there was not any song of the original animation movie. Finally, I have to say that I do not recommend this movie to anyone and especially to any ""Mulan"" fans."
1578,If it was a stand alone film 10/10 but compared to the original it's ok they only had one song from the original and I wasn't even sung it was background music and they only had about half the characters from the original it seemed to be more about the message and I see why they would want to do that but coming from a point of view where I like the original it doesn't get your attention
1579,"I'm so happy to see such a beautiful movie with an amazing actress. I think it's true to the animation but also brings a new perspective so it has something new to give us, it's true to the culture, and most important, it gives a positive message to women that we can conquer anything and any space that once were told we can't."
1580,"Not comparable in the slightest to the animation. This standalone version of Mulan is amazing and disney writers do I great job of hashing all the various versions of the folk-lore together, making a beautiful film. The cinematography alone is stunning. The acting is great and what a role model for young girls. Be yourself and you will be the best you. Just a good mantra for anyone really."
1581,"Mulan was a beautiful, action-packed and well-written story that injects the bastardized 1998 version with new life via a more dramatic interpretation of the plot. Mulan was my favourite Disney film as a kid and the filmmakers really went the extra mile to ensure that the story was fresh and entertaining to everyone (not just kids)!"
1582,"This movie was an original in itself. It didn't HAVE to be just like the animation. Disney made it their own with some twists and differences but still managed to follow the main storyline. This movie wasn't meant to be a musical. The live action Cinderella wasn't either and people didn't hate on it. Sure they took out the love story with Shang and the trusty sidekick with Mushu but instead they made the story about Mulan finding love within herself and being true instead of basing the whole film around being in love with a fellow officer. Her fellow warrior men helped her defeat the bad guy and I think that was a good cover for Mushu.This movie in my opinion had a lot of good female empowerment and that it showed Mulan didn't need a male character to come in and sweep her off her feet. She did the damn thing herself and I really think people are missing this message. I recommend thinking about these point when watching instead of taking all these bad reviews and not giving it a chance.People wanted it to be exactly like the original, but come on, then it would be boring and unoriginal. It was filled with emotion, action and great new characters."
1583,"I don't understand all the negative reviews. I liked this movie A LOT! Although not true to the cartoon, it was very entertaining and had a great message. A movie about women taking their place. That witch was a complicated, thought-provoking character. Fabulous scenery and choreography."
1584,"Mulan is worth watching, I checked her so many negative reviews. People are comparing with 1998 animation film. I prefer this movie instead of that. There is no much difference in the story line - here Phoenix is added instead of comic dragon.
Visually the film is so good. I expected there will be lot of action as per the poster but its turn to be a routine. May be because of Covid-19 people are giving -ve to a Chinese story."
1585,"If you're interested in watching Mulan, go for the animation version, not this movie."
1586,"Mediocre is the best word to describe this mess of a movie.Mulan went from being a regular girl who becomes a hero with bravery and love on her side, to a superhero of sorts who pretty much doesn't need to learn anything throughout the move and remains the same.It's extremely boring, and frustrating!"
1587,"Am I glad I watched this this on putlocker, would not paid even 50 euro cents for this film."
1588,"I was excited about this one. Unlike others, I did not watch the original animated film and I was not acquainted with the story, so I was looking forward to just enjoying the film. Alas...The photography is beautiful, there are some visually arresting moments and some of the performances are quite decent. Sadly, that's as far as the positives go. The story is clumsily conveyed, characters aren't sufficiently developed to feel invested in them and the script is remarkably tacky, even painful at times.Is this movie terrible as some have made it out to be? Absolutely not. I think people are - perhaps rightly - disappointed because expectations were high for a story that means much to many and those expectations were fundamentally not delivered on. But as a standalone film, sans that context, it's an OK, lighthearted, positive film worth watching."
1589,"I know a lot of people didn't enjoy it for their reasons, but honestly being a huge fan of the mulan franchise and the original Disney movies mulan 1 and 2 this movie was an epic way of showcasing the idea of who mulan is. I wish there was more of the love interest involved but hopefully there will be a mulan 2 with the real cast again :) 10 stars"
1590,"The movie was amazing, hands down. This is the best remake. Why do the same movie as last time? How could they anyway?"
1591,"I found this to be a visually stunning movie, beautifully shot and the dark subject matter of war and death was handled with a sensitivity so that the movie never became harsh or horrific, despite some awesome battle scenes. Many arrows find their target but due to the lack of blood and gore, it enters the realm of make believe which makes it suitable for older children. I'd you're looking for a carbon copy of the cartoon you'll be disappointed. Watch the cartoon. This is different, for a different audience."
1592,We loved this movie and do not understand the negative sentiment by fans of the original movie that expected a complete remake in live-action format. The cinematography was absolutely beautiful and the story was well adapted albeit without the music and cartoon creatures.
1593,"I loved the original and I enjoyed this version as well. Beautifully shot, great cast, and entertaining. The plot had some holes but the haters just wanted a joke cracking dragon side kick"
1594,They used the name from the original and that was about it. Some great landscape scenes but overall it was bad and cringeworthy.
1595,"Honestly, if I hadn't watched the original mulan, maybe I would've rated this higher. The whole film was pretty average. I enjoyed some of it, but I felt like it didn't capture my attention as much as the animated one. I honestly wish the original songs were in this movie, it would've really made me happy. I do wish they kept Mulan's original love interest. I know that no matter what direction the movie went, not everyone would be pleased-but I waited forever for this movie to come out, it just didn't reach my expectations."
1596,"I mean, little talking dragons and songs were removed for what I can only assume to try and make the movie more ""realistic"".Well it couldn't be worse at that. Even after you look past the ""why is everyone in ancient China speaking English"", you get some peacock constantly flying around in disguise of a ""phoenix"". And for a movie where a literal war and multiple battles happen, people get stabbed and shot by arrows, not a single drop of blood in the entire movie. Not one finger-cut or even a little scratch. And then there's some sorry attempt at some romance(?), I don't even know.4/10, would not watch again. And even a 4 feels generous."
1597,"Mulan was all about her intelligence and ability to prove that a woman can be valuable as a man, especially in Chinise culture. Instead this movie looks like another super hero movie, where she was born with some abilities making her better than men and women without proving any point."
1598,"There was a time that Disney knew what they are doing and now we live in a period of time that they are literally what has been achieved hardly.Have to wash the cartoon again to wash this poison away.Actually, I recommend to watch the pirated version, So it would an example how to not make a movie."
1599,"It's bad, really bad. Felt like one of the worst B-grade film altogether.
Disney failed badly at this one, please don't repeat the same mistake with the director.
We cannot have another Spider-Man..."
1600,"I was sailing the high seas and there were rumours of a new treasure to be acquired.
Alas, it was all a ploy by the Crafty Corrupty Pooh band of pirates to lead honest sailors like us off the trail.
If any of you fellow sailors feel like checking this part of the Patch for yourself, don't."
1601,What a boring movie. Bad CGI. Movie were too easy to predict. Bad acting at the actor too
1602,"I loved the 1998 animated version so I was a little worried how this would measure up and wasn't sure what to expect because so often I find that live-action remakes falls short of their animated counterparts. Well, my worries were unfounded because apart from sharing the the general storyboard, this version does not try to be another remake. I can almost visualize the producers in 1997 asking themselves ""should we make this a kids movie or a movie for a mature audience?"" and then flipping a coin. Well, we know that the animated version won that coin-flip but had the coin landed the other way, this is how that mature film would have been made. I think this film is as good as the 1998 version - different, but as good. In fact, trying to comparing the two films is like trying to compare milkshake with beer - sure both are beverages and quench thirst but they're fundamentally different. This version targets a more grown-up audience and the plot has matured. However, that, I believe, is also the root cause of many of the negative reviews you see here - misplaced expectations. Some reviewers confuse that with the quality of the movie - read some of the negative reviews and you'll see what I mean. As I said, this is no longer a movie for small kids, it is mature film that targets a grown-up audience. The plot is well scripted and the fighting scenes are exciting; relatively realistic and not the full-blown martial arts fighting as you'd see in some kung-fu movies. The story is quite engaging and I think it connects more emotionally with the viewer than the animated film which is mostly cute and funny. The plot pretty much remains unchanged: Mulan, who is a bit of a tomboy, tries to protect her father from being drafted to the army so she takes his place disguised as a man and through that experience discovers herself. The values of honesty, loyalty and family permeates Hua Mulan's actions and I found that quite a refreshing change from the usual action / hero / romance films that floods the market. Another thing I loved about the film was the way they captured the scenes; landscapes, architecture and sweeping scenery are amazingly well filmed and I wish my screen was bigger so I could truly immerse myself in the images. Stunning cinematography. Maybe it's the Covid fears but Disney should have been released this film in the cinemas because the televisions at home struggle to do the movie justice. And to wrap this review up - This is in my opinion the best film I have seen from Disney in a long time and It's absolutely worth watching. Don't make the mistake to think that this is the live-action version of the animated film. This is the mature version with a heart....and thank God, without need for comic relief."
1603,"I'm sorry , but this movie is not that great.... it had so much potential. But they blew it... Everything felt so cheap and it all happened so fast and so easy.They literally took everything that was good about the original movie and tossed it in the trash.And the soundtrack was boring and awful compared to the animated Mulan."
1604,"It was bland, the editing was just chaotic and everything about it was chaotic. It should've been kept a musical."
1605,"Watch Mulan with an open mind. Forget all the reviews. It was too harshly criticized buy is a different movie. They didn't adherr strictly to the animation.2. Who makes a war movie with no blood? They should have made it 16+. In trying to reach a larger audience the movie was inconsistent in it's themes.3. The movie, in trying to please everyone failed to satisfy no one. It would have been a much better movie if the directors werr given the freedom to be bold."
1606,"The original Mulan is one of Disney's very best, mostly due to it's great humour and fun, so when I heard there was no Mushu character here I was a little sad, expecting them to play it straight rather than have magic and comedic elements but willing to give a serious take on the story a go. However, they don't actually remove the supernatural from this, in fact they add way more completely trash tier supernatural elements into it, done with awful characters and even worse CGI quick cut action. The acting here is bad, the characters are bad, the story and writing is bad and has nothing new, the CGI is awful and makes the whole movie look like a complete mess any time there's any action going on. Add to that the absurd way this movie was rolled out on Disney+ for a pile of money that no one should have to pay for any film and this is a VERY easy one to highly recommend skipping."
1607,"Disney made a lot changes from original story, add some nonsense action and witchcraft, let me feel like Lion King without lion. I love old cartoon one, made me fun and warm. And Disney should learn not every movie need a superhero."
1608,"As a person who grew up with Disney shows and also very familiar with the Chinese martial movies of old and new I think it is admirable that a Disney with a western lady director has been able to create this nice mix of folklore with a sound foundation for the Chinese culture.Some may cynically say it was targeted also for the Chinese market - so I would say yes, and it will be a smart commercial move to do so. But beyond that, on the story merit itself - it stand its ground and Yifei wonderful performance capture the essence of Mulan. Niki has a sensitivity which raise the quality of this movie higher.for a western director to understand the soul of the Chinese culture, I will give her high marks for this. To add colour and beauty into the set and the cinematography, kudos too in the line of the Zhang Yimou etc - set piece and so on. It was delicate but strong, beautiful and elegant.This is not the Mulan of the Disney carton which is a soulless work which panders to the western idea of how such stories should be. That is why it didn't resonate with the Asians watching that - it was a farce with songs. I would much prefer Frozen if I want to watch something in that mode which is true to the core of that story.The reason why a lot of reviewers don't get it especially those from the western culture is, they don't understand. What I say next will probably piss them off, but it is basically the lack of soul , the lack of depth in their own culture and history. That is why I said Niki to her credit, was able to capture the. essence of it as a non Chinese. The other reason is just misplaced notions that they are helping someone by protesting or writing down this movie. The movie should be examined on the basis and merit of its script and work alone and not be imbued with the US-China ""war"" going on. 90% of the review here has really nothing to to do with the movie per se.In the end, in future it won't matter as the younger generation moves about more and there are more sharing of such worlds and listening and people will be aware of different cultures and norms and learn to accept and even appreciate it. This movie opens a door for others to share in that folklore which must transmit the soul of the movie - which is universal - it is about family, devotion, loyalty and as Jet Li and Donnie has succinctly put in, the other element which was added by Niki...true - true to yourself - how true, both cultures are slowly merging and finding universal things in themselves and this is why this movie works for meYifei convey the new Chinese girl who did what she has to do to protect the family she love - she did not run away , she took the load. In the end, everything work out well and she brought honour to the family - a very Chinese thing - and this is why it has soul. There won't be a bone spur kind of cop out story here."
1609,"I was a cartoon fan from my childhood. But, for some reason and busy life, I never got chance to watch the cartoon version of Mulan. My wife is a fan of cartoon Mulan and was excited about this movie. So, watched it together.I am a guy who loves high quality movies, I was just amazed by this movie and story. I liked how they showed the whole story. The father's Love brought tears in my eyes. The acting was good. The direction and story telling was very nice. I was shocked looking at IMDb rating, because I think it deserves an average of atleast 8/10. I think people the comparing with there childhood cartoon. They should realize this movie has some different writers and directors. Every movie maker has there own version. Every batman movie is different. The cartoon Mulan is also one version of another story teller.Tobe honest I loved this movie, it deserves more appreciation. If you can see from a neutral point of view, you will see the movie team did a great job! I feel sorry for them because they can not release this good movie in theatre due to corona.I don't want to convince someone to like it or not. But I think any artist or creative person will like it. 10year later this will the original Mulan for the kids of today. Thanks!"
1610,"Great action movie, with fascinating story, and most importantly, Liu yifei act so great"
1611,"Definitely a cute and adorable film. Stands apart from the original, and keeps in line with more chinese culture, Mulan is a great girl-power film for the next generation. Packed with terrific action sequences, amazing cinematography, and a beautiful score, the story creates a different feel for Mulan and gives her a boost from being clever and skillful, to bada** and powerful. Wonderful movie and worth the watch."
1612,"When I read the reviews here I was reluctant to watch Mulan, as many were really negative.I gave it a chance anyways and I'm glad I did. This is a beautiful movie, that tells an engaging story. I honestly don't understand all the negative reviews.The acting was good, the story telling too and its refreshing that its not just another blockbuster action/superhero movie, which are way too many of at the moment.I for one would highly recommend this movie. Just ignore the negative comments and give it a chance."
1613,"Look I love animation. But I am not in to the musical animations. This Mulan was the type of movie I like. It had good action scenes and a good story.I think Disney took a big risk with this during Covid days, but even before all this to make it more of an adultish type of movie. Let's face it, there are so many things that people will hate it for already.The cast
To mature
Not like the animation
unrealistic
Whatever else.But I like this movie just on the enjoyment factor. The movie uses some great martial artists and tries to show a WAR movie. I did enjoy the movie overall. Will it be the best movie of all time . No. Was it groundbreaking no. But it was fun and entertaining and for me that'a all cared about."
1614,"This is not the cartoon. Don't let others ""disappointment"" deter you from watching. It sends an incredible message to young women and it is a great story. If you're going into it with the expectation that it be exactly like the cartoon, you'll be disappointed. It's a great movie that stands on it's own. As a dad of a daughter, it's definitely a movie with a great lesson to show women can do anything men can."
1615,"While I was excited as heck for this movie, it was by far the most disappointing live action that Disney has released. The cast did fine, but there were so many issues that it cannot all be addressed in this. I would save yourself the time and money and watch the old animated film instead."
1616,Mulan has always been my favorite Disney movie. Because of that I followed the making of it and didn't expect the happy-go-lucky movie the original is. I love that it is more true to the culture it comes from and is reminiscent of classic Chinese martial arts movies.
1617,"Like my title, I have heard all sorts about this movie. Truth is it wasn't bad at all. Great for a kids flick besides all the killing. I was surprised at that. Some are boycotting it because of politics and I say the same thing about the movie industry as with the gaming industry. Politics don't belong in movies and games. Everyone has their right to their opinion, but that doesn't mean they don't do a good job in what they do for a living. It was pretty good with decent action and the acting was very good. Awesome to see one of my favorite actors back on screen in Jason Scott Lee. Watch it. It will surprise you."
1618,"This movie is beautiful visually, amazing costumes, badass fight scenes, and a fully developed plot line with a lot of character growth. I'm scratching my head, trying to figure out what movie some of these people watched. Did they not see the PG13 rating? Of course it's not the same as the animated. It's far more intense and mature. I'm not sure why people seem to think the story hinged on a comedic dragon. There were still moments of humor, it's not all heavy. I'd probably give it an 8-9, but the ridiculous low ratings are making this movie look unfairly bad."
1619,"I get it. You want your cartoon back. Ok, go watch the cartoon. This movie is a gorgeous retelling of the Mulan story. Cinematography is stunning, action is great, and the Mulan actress is a powerhouse. I enjoyed it all. Stop being haters."
1620,"This was a lovely, poetic and engaging remake. Fantastic acting, directing and cinematography. I loved the animation Mulan and this did not disappoint."
1621,There are many versions of Mulan that exist. Glad Disney was able to release live action movie that looks at other Mulan versions and focus on metaphors vs. talking animals.
1622,"If you take this on it's own - as a new movie - it is an easy 8/10. The cinematography is amazing, the lead actors are very good, and the story... well it's Mulan so it is a great story! It starts out slower than I'd like, but it picks up. Overall I would have been happy spending the $15 to see this in a theater - but I'm much happier for our whole family to be able to watch a great story about a female. Thank you Disney+ !"
1623,"I think most people are upset about the $30 for streaming a movie.It's more of a 7, but I gave it a 9 to balance.If you're expecting this to be a complete remake of the original, you're going to be disappointed, which by reading the reviews is the majority.The negatives, I believe Wushu wasn't added because it wasn't representative of the perception of a dragon in the Chinese culture.It isn't a typical Disney movie, as it lacked the song and dance as most Disney movies have. If you expected that, yes, you will also be disappointed. Also a little more combat/violence for a Disney movie, the arrows going through the chest?With the negatives aside, the positive was the cultural sensitivity and promoting the Chinese culture to the world. The production. The vocal training? or was it vocal CGI? I'm a fan of Jet Li and Donnie Yen (because of my background in MMA) and their speech/acting is better than all their previous movies.Also positives, casting Gong Li, and the cameo from the original Ming Na Wen, getting Jet Li AND Donnie Yen in the same movie.Also positives, it's still at the core a Disney movie, finding that heartfelt magic, the moral of the story at the end : ""Loyalty to Family"". Will this be a Frozen franchise phenomenon? No. But come on, it's better than John Carter or Tomorrowland and we all know it."
1624,"I think it was a very beautiful and very detailed film, do not want to compare it to the cartoon of the nineties but as a film in itself. The whole atmosphere of the film was great even though it could not be seen in the cinema. I loved the game of the two famous actors Donnie Yen and Jet Li. Anyone who has criticized the film badly has probably not seen the huge investment in set and costumes, a recommended film for the whole family. I loved the good ending"
1625,One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Please don't waste your time and money. Almost none of the scenes made sense and were horribly executed and there was 0% character developement. It seemed like I was watching a bad play instead of a movie.
1626,"I get why the director left mushu out for realism. But he was a big part of the movie back then. With how graphics are today, it would be amazing to see what they could have done with him. So im very disappointed"
1627,"This is not the same move. It shares roughly the same plot line as our beloved Mulan, but is fundamentally a different movie. Even Mulan is different- she has a sister, no companions (cricket and Mushu), she has her 'powers' or 'chi'. She doesn't build herself up or grow in the same way. The dialogue is terrible. No songs.
It is a different movie."
1628,"Too much attention to décor and so little to the story. This is not Mulan , this is another Chinese fantasy story, where the main character shares the same name with the animated one. That's it. With that budget it could have been a lot more, but they settled to mediocre. Shame."
1629,"Really bad movie, the title ""Mulan"" doesn't fit. The whole story is different and that movie sucks"
1630,The Original was Amazing but disney and their bad actors ruined this Movie!
1631,"Mulan is a live-action adaptation of the animated movie of the same name and can be seen on Disney +. The film is directed by Niki Caro, the director of Whale Rider and The Zookeeper's Wife.In the film, the Chinese Empire is attacked by a rebellious Rouran army led by Böri Khan (Jason Scott Lee), who receives help from a witch Xianniang (Li Gong). The Chinese emperor asks each family to send a man to join the Chinese army, so that they can fight the enemy army. Because Mulan (Yifei Liu) her father is the only man in her family and he cannot join the army due to his old age and shortcomings, Mulan decides to pretend to be a man and enlist in the army. Here she has to hide the fact that she is actually a woman, in order to keep the honor of her family. For example, she starts training undercover to support the Chinese army and in the hope of remaining in control of the rebels.Director Niki Caro and cinematographer Mandy Walker have portrayed the film in a beautiful way. The Asian culture is clearly shown in the film. The film beautifully shows the mountainous areas in China. Apart from the beautiful images, the film is unfortunately not that special. The problem is more with the script, how the film tells its story and how they put it all together.
Unlike the animation, Mulan in this movie doesn't really need to train herself to become a real warrior. As a result, her character lacks the structure that the same character had in the animation. In this film they try to bring out more that women, just like men, can also be warriors for the army. Despite the good intentions of this post, the script and how they bring Mulan up from the beginning also let it go.
To make this movie a bit more respectful to the Chinese audience, they kept the popular character of Mushu, who was voiced by Eddie Murphy, out of the live-action verse. By removing this character, the film loses many of the comedic moments that the animation does have and this film comes across a bit too serious and becomes more long-winded.Unfortunately, the effects also come across a bit frayed in the film, so you can see where they used CGI or a green screen.Unfortunately, the characters are not that special in the film. Most of them play the soldiers of the Chinese army, but are not really developed further in the film except for a few moments. Yifei Liu does portray the role in a fun way in the film, but due to the lack of structure of her character, she does not come forward that much. Donnie Yen knows how to provide some small comedic moments as the commander of the Chinese army, but he has also done better and more comical acting in his other films.This movie can be seen on Disney + at a rather high price, which the movie is actually not worth. For a better version, stick with the animated movie or wait for the movie to be seen for free on Disney + later this year if you have a subscription."
1632,"Disney.
I tho you can make some good quality movie. You choose the Bad actor of Mulan
Really!
No emotion! No feeling.waste my time.
Didn't see bad movie and actor since ages
If you guys really want to see it.
Don't pay for it. Because it's not worth."
1633,"The dialogue in this movie makes kindergartners seems like shakespeare. Also, this is just a stripped down version of the original with less content and story."
1634,"There are so many stereotypes in this movie that I feel sick. At the same time, they have no respect for Chinese traditional culture. I am even curious, why these Chinese actors would act in this movie. If that is for beauty, or for the polt of the movie, maybe I can understand it. But I couldn't feel any beauty from this movie."
1635,"Straight off, the thing that ruins this movie completely is the writing. This is some of the worst writing I've ever seen in a cinema history, I hope the writers never pick up a pen again. The dialogue is so cringeworthy and just flat out embarrassing, at times I honestly thought I was watching a chinese film dubbed in english. As for the storyline, it's pure garbage. Everything you loved about the original Mulan, this film completely ignores; Mushu isn't in it, the cricket isn't in it, the three funny friends Mulan has aren't in it and most importantly Shang-Li isn't in it. The fighting scenes are so mediocre that it's sad to watch, I can't get over the fact that they had a 200 million dollar budget for this movie when the cgi in this looks like something from a 2000s chinese tv drama. There is absolutely nothing good about this movie, the only reason I'm giving this a 2 is because I had some good laughs on how bad the dialogue was. The new storyline is filled with so many plot holes that you just yell out WTF every 15 minutes, so many things make no sense, even the costumes look pretty bad at times. The lead actress shows no emotion at all, she has no idea how to act. Maybe Disney thought her status in China would make this movie more successful, but in that case they should've gotten a Chinese actress who can actually show facial expressions. I have a pretty good idea of why Disney decided to make this movie the way this is, it's clearly suppose to be catered towards Chinese audiences, but even all the cultural pride can't overshadow how bad of a movie this is. If you we're planning on boycotting this movie because of politics, you can now also boycott it for being a disgrace to cinema and writing. I'm here to warn you, there is absolutely no need to ever watch this movie unless you're trying to torture somebody."
1636,"I was so excited to see Mulan because the animation is one of my most favorite cartoon of all time. But the actors' acting, screenwriting, and cinematography fell really flat. Mulan never showed any emotion, she just looks like a show-off soldier with a gift of chi. The scenes progression felt rushed and the transitions were not smooth. It's ridiculous when Mulan went back to the camp after being expelled, the Commander went from almost killing her to make her the leader of the batallion. Mind is blown.There were only 2 jokes in the whole movie and both were lame. Even the way they laughed were unconvincing. Funny how the animations show alot more emotions than the human's version."
1637,"Terrible! As a Chinese, I can tell you this film was terrible!
Some of you may think this file shows Chinese culture, however that's all wrong.
They max lots of Japan.Korea and other I don't know what's that things.
Mulan is a story about ""BE WHO YOU ARE""! Not to tell people to respect parents and do whatever they said,ok?
This is Chinese parents old-school thinking, and I can't believe Disney spent sooooo much money for this. Don't waste your time and money for this film!"
1638,"Great movie, beautiful view of chinese culture.
Great martial acts
Great acting & beautiful actress.
Watch & enjoy ;)
peace"
1639,"Oh boy, where do I start?
Plot is a mess. Just to point out a few glaring points: Why would Gong Li work with Bori Khan, who clearly disrespect her and treats her poorly, if her Qi allows her to possess others and force them to do things that benefits her anyway. Why would the commander of an army agree to Mulan's request anyway and even lead that team back to the capital city? Abandoning your post is probably punishable by death and they had no reason to trust her.
Costume and architecture is a horrible, I can't believe the lead costume designer can say they're honest with their work in a straight face on camera and this is the work of studying with material from Europe and 3 months in China. Traditional costuming enthusiasts does better than this. I don't mind if they're not accurate. Nobody does historically accurate costumes anyway but at least don't mix all the different styles together. Even in an AU European court movie, you won't really want to see one people dressed in Tudor clothing and the next in Regency and the other in Victorian.
And the special effects... Are you sure that's a phoenix and not a kite?"
1640,"Better save your money and time for something worth it. The acting is bad, the plot is boring. Disney really took out the core of the original and made this into a cringe-worthy mary sue type of lame movie. And worst of it, it's not even good action movie!
I'm going to re-watch the animated version to heal myself from this monstrosity."
1641,"Like most people I've been anxiously anticipating this movie for months. I came in with no expectations other than hearing there was no Mushu and no musical numbers. Instead of remaking the animated film into a live action movie Disney chose to reimagine the story of Mulan.
I see a lot of complaints from unhappy folks who wanted a remake not a reimagining. If that's what you're expecting, skip this version and pop on the cartoon.
This reimagining is not fast paced. Far more methodical and pretty much all drama with little comic relief. Reminded me more of watching old war movies, which is pretty spot on for Mulan-a film about a female warrior. I am fine with the change in love interest, far more practical to find love with an equal instead of a commanding officer. The action sequences are more in line with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, etc. Aligned with Chinese cinema so that makes sense too.
I've read a lot of complaints about characters not getting much development through the movie-reminder this is called Mulan. Hint hint, wink wink-it is about her development. So again made sense while I was watching.
Favorites: the scenery. Breath taking, beautiful landscapes.
Less favorite-as a war story about Mulan there is no way I'd let my young nieces and nephews watch this. There's a reason it's PG-13. Not for young kids, they can keep watching the lovable, funny cartoon. Also the Phoenix seemed very unnecessary. Without it the plot would have still been quite a full circle story."
1642,"I didn't watch previous releases of Mulan flicks .
I'm not aware of the story also.
And about the movie matters, it's a way better watch, all the cast did their best. Production is also good. and best part of its not lengthy and not boreing."
1643,"As a life-long Disney fan and Chinese American, I find this movie shockingly bad and downright offensive. Is this what Disney thinks of Chinese culture? What a joke. Disney's entire batch of remakes of the classic animated movies has been a disaster in movie-making (if not in the box office). I hope they rethink this strategy of remaking joyful animated films as serious live action movies with the worst scripts in the world, and none of the fun of the songs and musical numbers."
1644,Don't listen to all the judgemental people giving reviews. If you honestly expect live movies to be like animated movie from 20+ years ago I can't tell you what's wrong with you.I really enjoyed the movie bringing a more realistic and following old traditional Chinese life. If you can just sit back and enjoy a movie without trying to tear it down to make yourself feel better about who you are then you'll enjoy this movie
1645,"I get why people are upset. Liu Yifei said something about the Hong Kong police and that's shocking from someone with a Chinese background. I get what she did was awful but you have to see the movie as the way it is not just of what she said. I see why Disney was trying to make this different from the animated version but I enjoyed the movie like Liu Yifei's presence as Mulan, Gong Li's and Jet Li's acting but I feel like it would've been better if they did a better job on the story. The story did feel a little messy like how it was put together and some of the action scenes did feel like a typical Chinese action film. Although it didn't have the musical, Mushu, and the cricket, it was still an okay movie. Definitely not worth the 30 dollars though. I would give the movie a 7.5/10 if I had to."
1646,"First of all, this movie doesn't deserve the hate and harsh criticism that it gets. Everyone who knows the original should not compare the two, because it's unfair. The original from 1998 is
untouchable, but that doesn't mean that this new movie doesn't deserve to have its own moment. In my opinion, Disney will never nail the live action movies until they decide to either go a completely different route from the original or go on to make a carbon copy of the original. With this movie they also tried (like before) to make a mix, but that doesn't work. The scenes that were reminiscent of the original felt out of place and forced. But the brand new scenes and story lines where refreshing and I enjoyed them. Also the fighting scenes were exciting and the actors did a good job.
Also, for me, the story of Mulan can be either a complete children's movie or an epic and mature film for adults. This in-between-movie was nice but the story just has so much more potential and I feel like it got restricted by Disney."
1647,"I don't know who the target audience is, since this movie has a PG13 rating?If you have kids, watch Disney's animated version of Mulan. It is far superior, and much more entertaining for kids and grownups alike because of the charming songs. Furthermore Mushu. Just do yourself a favour and trust me on this one, don't waste your time."
1648,"Hua Mulan has always been a brave and praiseworthy figure in China. Disney's film is still very good, although some places are still very American, but this film can see Disney's sincerity of respecting Chinese culture. I also saw crying several times about the plot of family relationship. In addition, the appeal of music is so powerful that I have to convince Disney's ability to be imaginative!"
1649,"Makers just changed the whole script but saved some characters, basic storyline and some epic scenes.......here's a new mulan. It's more of a Chinese cultural and trditional version of classic mulan , dark, seriously made action movie .Niki Caro managed to focus on those minor mistakes were made in mulan(1998) but made several major mistakes in her adoption. She made it more reasonable like Bori Khan's past and why strong women hide their existence.It's good to see an action-packed dark adoption of an epic classic but except great locations and epic sets it's nothing like a Disney movie .If you loved the animated Mulan then I'll suggest to please stay away from this one or if you want to then don't expect the same mulan . Casting of Mulan - Liu Yiefi is one of the most adorable lead actress of Disney live action after Emma, Lily and Elle . ( according to me) Cinematography and background music is perfect . Ending is not as effective as Mulan (1998)."
1650,"A free, beautiful, relaxed and happy fairy tale, I can't stop smiling when I look at it. Although the overall style of the film is not my favorite style, there are still a lot of aesthetic points. Disney's music has always maintained a super high standard, and the Chinese lyrics are translated very accurately. The part of Mulan's disguise is so handsome!"
1651,"Combined with the traditional Chinese story, the film reflects the female values advocated by the United States, women's mutual assistance and the realization of women's self-worth. I have always been proud of the story of such a woman in ancient China, but it is a pity that such a story is no longer available in the later dynasties. There are many wonderful stories in historical stories, but there is such a story about women's power that Hua Mulan in China has really been the only one that has made a great contribution. Women are not born to be entangled with worldly affairs. Women can do what men can do."
1652,"I honestly do not understand the bad reviews of this - especially with people complaining about Disney's Live Actions - if you know you don't like them as much as the animations, don't watch them. Mulan was a great animation, but this live action is just as strong, full of action and still had the essence of Disney Magic. Don't listen to the bad reviewers, honestly, I've seen 'too chinese' (seriously guys?) and 'too expensive' here too often to count - the movie is honestly lovely and the acting and action scenes are great."
1653,"Puzzling plot,confusing lines(Hey,this story happened in China!Some lines are just unconscionable.)......I just feel I wasted my money.
What happened to Disney?Why thier cartoons like Zootopia are so wonderful,and why their films like this are so terrible?
Last but not the least,Mulan stands for patriotism,strong determination, independence and filial obedience.It's ok for a movie to revise,but when we can't see the valuable spirit of the roles,it become a bad film."
1654,"They wanted to be more realism? But it ended up being ridiculous. Story and script should be stronger. The dialogues are cringy sometimes... some stuffs, like motivation and relationship should be explored more.I dont fancy the changes that they did on the character Mulan too. With her being the chosen one and this thing with chi as magical forces... like please... chi is not for man only, or we wont have cool women warriors like the snake lady from that Andy Lau's series or the one from crouching tiger hidden dragon.I just wish everything was better... it didnt need to be scene to scene like beauty and the beast or lion king (which i found both hollow. Only the jungle book deserved the remake in my opinion). It just need a better story scene and script.Also on the side note, it would be more interesting if they erase all this magical power and has Gong Li's character to be someone who used deceit and hidden tactics, pretending to be a witch for the fear factor instead of actually being this half bake chi witch."
1655,"Disney please just stop itBad dialogue, bad acting, great cinematography and that's about it"
1656,"The live-action remake of ""Mulan"" is as two-dimensional as a cartoon.The flesh-and-blood version of the 1998 animated film is a paint-by-numbers tale of adversity, identity, honor and family. It's acceptable but hardly inspiring, classy but stiff, as the hollow-at-its-center tale lacks the soul needed to truly bring it to life.Yifei Liu is the title character, who in order to save her ailing father Hua Zhou (Tzi Ma) disguises herself as a man and joins China's Imperial Army. There, she proves herself to be a true warrior, but is forced to keep her true self a secret because of tradition and prevailing gender politics.Stories of women disguising themselves as men date back centuries, from Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"" to the '80s comedy ""Just One of the Guys"" and beyond. The formula tends to be similar across stories - there's usually a bathing scene centered around the threat of a reveal, and there is indeed one here - and the final unveiling causes an initial shock that forces the naysayers to look inside themselves and examine their own beliefs. It's a time-honored storytelling device.""Mulan"" has a chance to set itself apart by steeping itself in Chinese lore, but the film's version of China doesn't dig any deeper than Epcot Center's. The costumes and the settings are on par for a big budget Disney production, but don't transport viewers to another world. It all renders a little flat.Director Niki Caro (""Whale Rider"" and the fantastic ""McFarland, USA"") relies heavily on CGI and wire effects that come across choppy rather than natural. When the characters in films such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or ""Hero"" fly through the air, there's a visual poetry to the fluidity of their movements, and their soaring feels like a majestic reflection of the human spirit. That magic isn't present here, and the action scenes don't achieve lift-off.As Xian Lang, a shape-shifting witch with the ability to transform herself into a bird, Gong Li has the film's most interesting role, and the only character with an interesting arc. Her shades of good and evil, and the kinship she feels with Mulan, show a depth that is otherwise missing from the proceedings.""Mulan"" does come with a simple, empowering message for young girls. But it doesn't achieve the high water mark of Disney's live action ""Cinderella,"" ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Lion King"" remakes, which brought fresh perspective to their cartoon counterparts. In this case, the animation felt more alive."
1657,"It was almost perfect until the end where the protagonist and antagonist met, I was expecting more action but it was short lived, and mulan did not fight enough to get that much hype in the end. Or perhaps we were expecting more than we could get."
1658,"I felt a little mislead by critical reviews claiming this was the best live action Disney remake, it is far from that. Look no further than the fact that it's nigh impossible to remember the names of any character outside of Mulan herself (and Cricket, for obvious reasons).The sorceress carried this movie as far as she could, but ultimately it was shot like a mid-90's martial arts movie, with little comedy and a cgi Phoenix, and that wasn't nearly enough to get the job done."
1659,"In live action Disney remakes, there is an over-saturated, too colorful to be realistic, quality to everything that makes each scene feel like you're walking into a candy store. I believe this is meant to appeal to children, reflect the colorful nature of the animated films, and provide a sense of happiness. It plays well during scenes of celebration, but if it were up to me I would prefer more natural color schemes rather than pushed saturation for the sake of simply being colorful. It seems to take some of the weight, quality, and sense of realism away from what we're watching. What it does for me is take the sense of danger out of the action sequences. When things aren't grounded enough in reality, the stakes don't feel high enough to make us really feel a sense of danger when we're supposed to. That said, within the confines that were likely provided by Disney in terms of violence, the fight scenes were pretty good, if not a bit too PG for a PG-13 film. Since they already had the PG-13 rating, I do wish they would have pushed the realism in terms of violence a bit more just to make us feel a sense of danger and worry for the characters. The general lack of that was made up for the few times we got to see Mulan do something like kick a spear into a man's chest, which was quite satisfying.Despite some of the dialogue being a bit cheesy and on the nose at times, I think they accomplished exactly what they were intending to, and made a pretty solid movie for their audience.It's not perfect, but it's very good.Was it worth the $30? Absolutely. Im underselling it in this post. A $30 ticket for a production this massive with so many good elements is nothing.What did they do well?
Most things. The sets, the props, the costumes, the scenery, the casting, the effects, the visuals, the music, the nostalgic elements and callbacks to the original film (which are ever present, yet not overdone or unfitting). There are more good things about this film than things worth judging. Niki Cari did a great job.Many people are saying this is the best Disney live-action remake yet, and I might have to agree. It's a toss up between Mulan and Cinderella.If you're a big Disney fan and you want something dazzling and adventurous to enjoy, or if you're just looking to kick back and watch something great for the whole family, this is it.EDIT: There is one outstanding weakness about Mulan (2020) that I didn't address yesterday when I wrote this review, and the more I think about it, the more I see it as problematic.
They took the concept of ""chi"" and used it as a force-like superpower in a way that I think hindered the film and story more than helped communicate the overall message.
Mulan is not an ordinary girl. In this story, she is much like a Luke Skywalker or Rey type character who is born with this special ability and power within her that she learns to harness throughout time. The story makes it clear that Mulan is not like everyone else. She is special. She personifies the ""chosen one"" storytelling trope (something that wasn't done in the original in which she was seen as a common, clumsy girl who simply stood for the right things and used her intellect, along with a bit of rebellion, to save China).
Giving Mulan these special powers and abilities took the message the movie should have told and turned it into something quite different, effectively saying that normal women can't do what men do. They have to be special.
Why can't we have more films of this caliber and budget simply feature strong female characters without having to give them superpowers in order to make them equal to the average man?
Overall, having given it more thought, I am changing my rating to a 6/10."
1660,A great movie with some powerful performances! It surely did justice to the original one. 👌
1661,"Nice plot of story, full of emotion and satisfied ending of story.."
1662,"The best bits are removed, including the classic songs and mushu. The editing is really strange, and cuts to quickly to new scenes often not allowing for the emotion to set in.Going for 'realism' in a fantasy movie with witches? Really strange, disappointing creative decisions made in this one."
1663,"All the people rating this movie 10 out of 10 I really would like to know how much Disney are paying you to do this.This Movie was shocking, save your money and time, do not watch this movie."
1664,"I know this movie is not perfect, but I embraced it happily and really enjoyed it! The visuals, the action scenes, and also the love among family, friend and woman & man. Mulan is my favorite Disney Princess and I'm glad Disney delivered a good movie. (I know it's not a 10 movie, more of a 7-8 movie, but I hate when people are saying it's bad because social media tells them it's bad, so it's a 10 for me)"
1665,"A simple Chinese story, about loyta, brave, true and devotion to family."
1666,This movie was very entertaining and beautifully shot with great fighting scenes. Also nicely mixed sound that I enjoyed in my home theatre. Don't let the bad reviews refrain you from watching the movie. The beautiful images alone makes it worth watching.
1667,"You never know what you're going to get with these Live Disney remakes. Some are good--Aladdin, some are okay--Beauty and the Beast, and some are trash--Lion King.Mulan falls somewhere in the middle. It has some decent cinematography and fight scenes, but many elements which made the cartoon Mulan so successful, were changed or nixed altogether. Mushu for example, is changed into a Phoenix and provides zero comedic relief. Mulan's Grandma is replaced with a sister. There are two bad ""guys"". It's truly like most of the people who grew up with these awesome kid cartoons, turned into hum-drum adults, with no humor, no vision, and simply want to make money off the hopes and dreams of those of us who want to recapture elements of our childhood. Many critical scenes just aren't in the movie. And with an awesome original soundtrack, there is nothing in this remake. No singing. No humor. Very little emotion. It feels bland. The best parts from the original aren't here. Overall, it's meh."
1668,This is not the cartoon mulan. I really liked it. It still had the same story line but a slightly more mature look at the story of mulan.
1669,"First off, i see alot of people saying that this movie shouldn't be serious, and complaining about how they removed certain characters. Its based off the Ballad of Mulan. The actual original story. If you constantly compare this to the ""original"" Disney one, you definitely wont enjoy the movie."
1670,Look Look i know it does not have the dragon and there is a lot of changes but its good its actually really good i watched this and i can watch it again please tale the time to watch the movie and then judge it because i like the movie
1671,"There is a lot to admire about the movie and overall it's a good movie, but so much of the film feels borrowed from other movies - movies that did it better.There are lines that come straight out of Star Wars. ""Join me by my side and together we can defeat the ..."" The force and the chi. ""It is ... too late for me.""The action scenes were fine and I enjoyed them, but I've seen much better Sequences in other films such as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.Same with the battles. Ran (Japanese) battles are visually superior but the battles here worked well.The bad guys all dress in black so you can easily know who to root against.There was An overuse of slow motion filming to create a sense of drama and tension.IMO, The ending was powerful and more emotionally fulfilling than the original."
1672,For all those low reviews come on???? Because of those I was not sure how it was going to be but I think it's been very harshly reviewed. It's stunning visually and made me giggle a couple of times and made me feel warm Inside. It reminded me of my young years watching Disney originals. This doesn't claim to be the original. It's been adapted and modernised which is what it's supposed to do like with everything in life moves with the times. I feel it captured the story well and made me reminisce of when I was a young girl watching it. Surely that's a good remake??? For me it's visually so much better then the original and I enjoyed as much as the original in different times. The acting was great. Few things I would of changed but nothing too much. Cmon low score reviewers get with the times. Times have moved forward from the originals. So will the films. I think it's worth a watch and I thoroughly enjoyed it. X
1673,"*WARNING SIREN* First of all, this review focuses solely on the film, and not the political beliefs that any of the actors hold. *SIREN OFF*Disclaimer over. The film is actually very good. If you're looking for a live action film à la Aladdin, the Lion King, this isn't for you. Whilst I absolutely adore those retellings, I fully respect them for going in a different direction with this. The action sequences are amazing to watch and the story adapts well to a live action adaptation. Yes, I would've loved to have seen Mushu, and all the classic songs, but the film works without them.The cinematography is excellent throughout, and the costumes and set are sublime, as you'd expect. There are few historical updates Disney have made which work well too.Having said all of this, I do find that the characters aren't as well defined in this version of Mulan. Whereas in the original, Mulan's soldier friends are fairly well set out and identifiable for their personalities, the same cannot be said for the characters in this film, and at times they can seem two dimensional. But don't let that put you off too much!All in all, it's a great action/adventure film that carries the spirit of the original tale, and the message of Disney's classic. Weirdly, you just kinda have to put the original film aside and give it a chance to enjoy it."
1674,"I was very sceptical of this movie for a while because the 1998 original was and is my favourite Disney movie of all time. It's a story of its own and has a beautiful theme throughout.Now, comes the 2020 live-action release and it did not disappoint. The characters were beautiful portrayed, even with the changes from the '98 version.Fans may be mad because there isn't any musical songs throughout, and I get that, but they've done it well with the stunning instrumental pieces that appear in the background, that resonate the songs we know and love.You won't be disappointed though, as Christina comes back and outdoes herself with a fresher rendition of Reflection, and the new song Loyal, Brave, True in the credits.There are so many differences to the original, and so many things they kept the same. It was a great addition for the movie and it kept you thinking as you already know the story, but not the fine tuning and added action that was coming!I think this movie was very tastefully done and compliments the '98 version nicely. I would recommend this to any fan of Mulan and to give it the chance it deserves, as I don't think you'll be disappointed.Loyal, Brave and True to the original story. Well done."
1675,"I was about to explode waiting for this movie, which originally was to premiere in theaters April 2020. So of course I paid to see it before the free December 2020 release on my Disney+ account.I was NOT DISAPPOINTED. I have not read the dismal reviews of others and it would not matter. I loved the animated Disney Mulan story and music, but was annoyed by the whole ancestral dragon and good luck cricket comedy relief throughout. This movie left all of that out with the more dignified image of the phoenix, sent by a loving father, looking after Mulan; and instead of a cricket we saw a likeable young man named ""Cricket"". Brilliant! Another aspect of paying homage to the first movie was using words and background music from the first movie very effectively, especially in the ""I'm going to make a man out of you"" sequence.Another thing I really, really loved about this movie was that it gave more background for how Mulan was able to achieve all that she did. She inherited it either genetically or through a strong love and admiration for her father, and appeared to have been secretly trained by him? This movie showed a father who was very progressive for his time and culture by being proud of his daughter for her strong qualities/abilities (her Chi), even though society did not approve of those qualities in girls. This similarly happened in the movie ""Brave"" between father and daughter only in that case the daughter developed obvious strong qualities gained from both parents, not just the father.I was intrigued by the Huns being helped by a witch who often presented as a hawk or falcon and who interacted and eventually was transformed by Mulan's stronger moral character. In the animated version, it was just a smart hawk spy for the Huns. The Huns were fleshed out pretty well and seemed like a real threat in the story, just as in the animated movie.And finally, I was very happy they dropped the whole love interest part out of this Mulan movie. Mulan's goals were to show honor for family and country and to save her father. She was very focused and not distracted. These are very admirable qualities and very exciting to see in a Disney movie, that too often has to throw in ""and they lived happily ever after"" endings for the female leads. I am sure there are those that were hoping she turned out to be a Lesbian or something, but the stronger ending is to leave sexuality out completely and show how strong a female can be in traditionally male skills/ roles. This movie did that well.I will be watching this movie over and over. Kudos to all involved with it's production!"
1676,"Mulan is my hero, hard work, never admit defeat, has its own position, is a hero to defend the country"
1677,"Disgrace to the original. What were they even thinking?
Ma-Ri Shu in a soulless empty bundle of time-waste."
1678,"Despite the controversies, I really liked this film and I recognize that it is one of the best remakes of Disney together with Maleficent.The cast is good but Li Gong's performance is brilliant.The action scenes are very well done.The visual effects are ok."
1679,"If you're looking for a live action interpretation of your childhood animated Mulan, look elsewhere. Dust off your old VCR if you have to. If you on the other hand are looking for a great and unique take on the legend of Hua Mulan, you have found it. It is a great retelling of the old Mulan legend. I think Niki Caro has done a great job in capturing the essence of the legend of Mulan and the notion of Honor in the Chinese tradition. Thank you for bringing this vision of Mulan to us. If you're boycotting this movie due to your personal and political belief against one of the actors of the movie, you are really depriving yourself of the magic and greatness this movie could have brought you. I pity you and I hope you change your mind and set your politics aside to enjoy the movie."
1680,"Nice to look at. The story boring, at times I was embarrassed for the writers. Kids might like this?"
1681,"This was fun and beautiful movie not even comparable to the orginal, really don't understand why everyone hates it. But I know these small minds were already made up when they couldn't have their way."
1682,"Beautiful, action-packed with lots of life lessons."
1683,"I was expecting this movie since it was announced.
What a great casting, Yifei Liu was the perfect lead choice, Donnie Yen and Jet Li at the position they deserved, Gong Li at a character apparently written for her.Nice cinematography with natural and production designed rooms, fantastic landscapes, immense Chinatowns that you cannot tell if they are real or CGI.Main script LOYAL to the original anime version, BRAVE changes of characters omitting boring Mushu and songs and inclusion of Gong Li's witch, TRUE as far as a westerner can tell to the Chinese culture.A light touch of Disney in the somewhat flamboyant color choices and in the absence of any drop of blood despite numerous killings.Better than the anime and better than the Chinese version made about a decade earlier which was only for adults.Now if you are a Chinese nationalist who doesn't like Chinese speaking English or American companies earning from Chinese folklore; or a political issues fanatic judging a movie from activists' targetted locations of shooting 1min of the movie, you might certainly get annoyed by minor things (some people rated 1 because the Phoenix was not talking); but if you are a non-Chinophobian normal person, you will certainly like it."
1684,Saw the film and loved it. Visuals are stunning. Ignore bad reviews who don't know what films are meant to be. Glad I watched it
1685,"I've never seen the original one, so i am really not able to compare but i loved this one a lot."
1686,Stop allowing hollywood to produce garbage. Do not support them. All they think about is money! Greedy rats
1687,"I loved the reimagined Mulan. I don't get why so many people hate on it. It was beautifully filmed,the costuming amazing and it felt SO MUCH more stressful with Mulan in the training camps. It's NOT the same as the original. It stands on it's own."
1688,"Just watched it and am gal surprised so many people hated it. Absolutely the best love action Disney ""remake"" to date. I am so glad they didn't try to make it cheesy and do all the songs from the original cartoon. It seemed so much more authentic. It reminded me so much of the Chinese films I love - Crouching tiger, hidden dragon and House of flying daggers. They really did a phenomenal job and it was so beautiful!"
1689,"I don't understand all the negativity toward this movie. In fact, it inspired me to write this movie. I enjoyed this new interpretation of ""Mulan"" as a modern action epic.In the past, with its live-action interpretations of its animated films, Disney has received criticism for pretty much making substandard copies of the originals. Here, the filmmakers dared to present a spin on the original movie, but not an exact copy of it. In doing so, the movie has artistic integrity, which should be applauded. It has a reason for being other than piggybacking on the original. If you want to see the original movie again, watch it, but don't criticize this one simply for daring to be different.There is much to enjoy here. The cinematography is stunning, with the camera capturing gorgeous landscapes and widespread battles from up above. This is epic filmmaking that was clearly meant to be seen on a big screen. It's a shame that, within most areas, it won't be because of the Covid-19 pandemic.The casting is perfect, and I liked the changes that were made to the story, particularly the fantastical ones. For example: the addition of a witch. The original Mulan telling is a legend passed down from generation to generation, and stories are often embellished. It's not bound by a need for realism. Plus, Gong Li is always entertaining to watch because she has a magnetic presence.Some minor quibbles are as follows. Mulan's disguise as a male soldier isn't very credible and, therefore, requires a leap of faith. (However, perhaps this is a result of modern, knowing eyes viewing it? After all, women have fought as men within battles in the past and pulled off the disguise.) Also, there's very little comic relief in the movie, but perhaps there shouldn't be within a truly respectful version of this tale.The good here far outweighs anything that's bad. But again, if you watch this expecting to see a live-action copy of the original, you're going to be disappointed. However, if you enter into it with an open-mind, you might just enjoy the sheer spectacle of all of it."
1690,Excellent movie! Very different than some other reimagined classics but still very entertaining with a realistic story in a beautiful setting.
1691,The bad reviews here are completely unfair. I feel that this is an epic movie for anyone to enjoy. If you were looking for a sing-along remake of the 1998 animation you could have seen by the trailers (which were already available a year ago) that this was not going to be it. I loved everything about it.
1692,"The 1998 Mula film has always been one of my favorite films, not just because it made me feel represented as a young Asian-American but the film had a good story with important messages. Not going to lie, I was both excited and scared about the 2020 film but I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt.Now I know the 1998 film has some flaws but the 2020 does just adds nothing. I really mean, nothing. The CGI looks questionable at times, the phoenix was confusing and useless but its most disappointing qualities are that of its changes to the characters and the plotline. For instance, the decision made to make Mulan a prodigy invalidates just about what made her stick as a character in my mind. She was proof that it was possible to become good at something so as long as you persevered. In the 1998 film, Mulan is offered a role as an advisor but in the 2020 film she gets an offer to be a guard. In the age of Disney trying to be relevant and/or woke, this comes off as insulting. There's really no good that comes out of preformative feminism which doesn't work to benefit all women. Instead it pits women against other women. Even the 2020 Mulan was at times innovative and in return, you give her a job that allows for her to not input any of her useful insight? How is that fair and why did Disney think it worked from a story perspective. What made the 1998 Mulan tick was that it explored the extreme ends of preforming masculinity (she was super awkward when she first met Li Shang) and femininity (I mean the matchmaker scenes were just perfect) and she failed at both. Instead she demonstrated that it's important to harness the qualities of both genders and that she only succeeded when she used both.Finally, I'm going to dock points a point for historical accuracy because while this was never marketed as some sort of historical epic and it's a Disney film, the thing with costuming, art direction and set design, is that it has to add to the story. I mean Moulin Rouge's costumes aren't really historically appropriate but they add to the feeling of what a spectacle Moulin Rouge is. For example, one could look to the type of house that Mulan's family lived in. As the story is set in Central China, the round houses were characteristic of those in the southwestern part of the country. I'm sure the shape of the houses aren't really relevant to the plot but it wouldn't hurt to change that aspect especially if you're not constricted by the confines of animation. To be frank, I find it insulting that Disney has all the money and couldn't hire a single (or better, several) East Asian Studies/literature professor to help them with that?I can't speak to how accurate the script was as I'm not terribly knowledgable about the original ballad and as such, I can't dock a whole lot of points for that. Perhaps it wasn't the worst film I've ever seen due to technicalities, but it it earned itself a one-star rating for its lack of innovation given its resources."
1693,"My rating is actually 8 but I give it 10 so the overall rating will be better despite these idiots' attempts.Haters are gonna hate. People who are just stuck with the animation are gonna hate. Yes, I love the animated but this one was just amazing. Only problem was that they didn't include ""short hair"" which is sad. But other than that, the movie was awesome. And the songs? It didn't need them"
1694,"First of all, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Although it does have its high and lows.Mulan is a historical figure. The stories can be told as seen fit instead of having to follow the footsteps of the Disney animation. I actually prefer this version of Mulan without all the unnecessary humor from the dragon sidekick, the cricket (as an insect) and the romance scenes.That being said. I wished they had followed through with the realism and hence here are aspects of the movie which could have been improved.#1 Fancy VFX that was not necessary and only added to the cringe factor. While the battle actions were great and one that remotely resembles 'wu sha' films, the witch and the phoenix with its plastic/kite looking tail was completely not necessary and did not add much to the plot. Instead they could focus more on Mulan's growth and the battle scenes (which by the way lack any tactics whatsoever)#2 Westernization of the dialogues. Although I understand that targeting the western audience makes bigger bucks in most of the cases, it hindered the overall experience of the movie. The three pillar of virtue for example could have been described in much more in depth if the movie was spoken in Mandarin instead of English. It just made the whole movie seem that bit shallower.All in all, decent and enjoyable watch. Not as bad as some of the reviews make out to be."
1695,"I never write reviews on here but was compelled to leave a good review when I saw all the negative ones, this is a solid 9/10 movie. Great action, good acting and really plays homage to the original in my opinion it's the best live action adaption of the classic Disney movies. Don't believe the haters I really can't understand the negative reviews on here but watch it for yourself and make up your own mind."
1696,It's not the same as the original version but this remake version is Great. Very Good movie.
1697,"We loved this movie. We watched it as it's own movie and not comparing to the original. I didn't want it to end and hope they make a sequel. It was beautiful, I felt invested. I don't normally care for action movies but Mulan was definitely an exception. I loved the moments there were references to the original like in background music. I think it was 110% worth the watch as long as you don't compare it the animated version because it's not remaking it. It's retelling the original legend and was done exceptionally well in my opinion."
1698,"Mulan is about a young woman in a society that doesn't value women showing that she can be as good as any man. It's a simple story and a powerful one that has importance even today. This film captures it perfectly. It's powerful, beautiful, fantastical and completely compelling and Disney has honoured that original legend with this film."
1699,Rated 10 to counteract the negative reviews... I'd give it a solid 8... Such a shame disney will have probably ruined this by not showing it on the big screen and hefty price tag on disney plus!
1700,"This is the Disney Corporate machine trying to appease shareholders with the marketing approach common to luxury items such as diamonds. By setting ridiculous prices for a variety of luxury products the sellers seek to establish a high value for an item with no basis in fact. The outrageousness of the price to view Mulan becomes the story, overshadowing any of the movie's actual merits. Don't misunderstand, Mulan is worth a look. Will you come away thinking, ""Oscar contender"", or ""Movie of the Year""? Doubtful. But while it does have its charms, it is mired in mediocrity with a predictable storyline, stereotypical characters, and borrowed martial arts and swordfight choreography from the likes of ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" who did it first and did it better. Under the period costumes and lavish sets, it is your typical ""underdog beats impossible odds"" movie. But credit where credit is due. No where did I see a caucasian, or non-Asian casting, so we have at least progressed from the days of Charlie Chan movies? I do tire of the commonality of the recent spate of movies with women characters tieing down their bosoms to pose as men. It takes a real ""suspension-of-disbelief"" for an audience to accept their disguise would fool anyone. But hey, if Superman can be Clark Kent by the mere addition of glasses, and no one is the wiser, then anything is possible in the land of movies and comic books."
1701,"Most people will argue that this movie did not capture our childhood. And they would be right. A lot of the kitschy musical numbers and larger-than-life lizard-dragon voices by Eddie Murphy will claim it's own ""honor"" and in its own right...this breathtaking reimagining of Mulan is a sight for sore eyes in a world of giving audiences what they expect versus what we need. We needed Mulan to take a much more mature stance as the audience itself matured. And the director/producers did this with poise, elegance and with taste. Major critics have knocked this down quite a few pegs but it's the heart of the story itself that lifts it back up despite the odds. Quite like Mulan herself."
1702,"Prejudice and ignorance raises it's head as viewers fail to appreciate an ancient culture; it's practices and the personality of people of that culture. As they moan about a Disney film not being funny...it's not a cartoon people; they are honouring the past of another culture. Mulan is not based on your disney cartoon, but of actual Chinese Forklore. American...ugh...educate yourself. You are not the centre of the universe.Signed, thank goodness I'm a Canadian."
1703,MULAN was amazing movie!! This live action version was very good and great action scenes too. Truly will make you be THANKFUL for your FAMILY!!!
1704,"This is amazing , one of the best live action so far"
1705,Enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. Very moving and inspiring. Keep it up. I am hoping they will make a series out of this.
1706,My hero!!nerver give up . This movie shows me that women can shine deserves all the good reviews
1707,"I honestly cant understand why people dislike this movie , its absolutely brilliant , i love it , ,,,, this is one of the best movies ive seen in years"
1708,"I highly recommend this movie if you want to make movies.Everything, from the acting, the awful CG, the non-existent morals, to the pacing is a perfect example how to not make a GOOD movie. There are very few and sometimes stunning landscape shots, but the majority was shot in a studio.
Nothing makes sense. The plot, the writing, the motivations, the fighting scenes are sooo comically bad, I thought this was a low budged Chinese MMA movie. But then I looked up the budged it was 200 mil... what?!The scene when the King killed 8 guys with some curtains was pretty fun."
1709,"High quality, nice cinematography. Outside of that, pretty bland.""Mulan"" story has a lot to live up to: the original Chinese story, the original Disney cartoon, and the magical fairy tale Disney expectations. This one seems to be even more ambitious by adding martial art movie elements.The end result is a movie that didn't have enough of any of those, and is a strange blend that has no appeal. Should have just picked one focus and ran with it.Honestly if this were not about Hua Mulan but some random Chinese girl, it would be a typical high budget but mediocre movie. It felt the ""Mulan"" name was superimposed so they could get the money from the fans of the original Disney Mulan cartoon, but then didn't put in fan favorite elements to please them.If I treat this not as a Hua Mulan story, I'd give it 5. But given the expectation of the target audience that they are trying to monetize, I give it a 4. Serious original Mulan cartoon fans, or even Disney fans, probably would rank this even lower."
1710,"The scenes went by so fast that there wasn't enough time for any emotional weight. The editing was so choppy some sequences didn't even make sense. All characters were only two dimensional and even though this may be true for the animated version, at least their performances could carry them and make them memorable. The dialogue was so bleque the writer barely had a voice at all. Would not recommend paying $30. Definitely prefer animated version."
1711,"When the going gets tough, you can always count on Mulan skywalker to save the day.no focus watsoever on her dilemma or inner struggles when she made the decision to take her father's place. perhaps she is secretly crying out load in joy that the golden opportunity for her to save the world has arrived.next comes the chi (the force?), making her so OP that we already know the bad guys are lining up for their ass kicked. which removes any tension in the movie.as for the other OP witch, who can easily possess anyone in the movie but the emperor (?) just simply switched side and sacrificed herself for no good reason.2 stars at best"
1712,"This is a complete standalone movie and as a standalone movie, its poor. The action scenes dont look very good, the characters are boring, i never felt anything for them therefore had no emotional connection to the story. The remake of aladdin embraced its originality and added a new twist which worked, unfortunately mulan stinks."
1713,Regardless of what anyone thinks...I loved this movie.
1714,"This movie entertains the plot well with many changes, but Liu Diep Phi's acting is still limited"
1715,If the haterd hste mulan then they are stupid and idiots for believing that mulan_2020 is a bad movie i think its good for kids and if you want to ruined the movie b we mu guest because i saw the animation mulan and is good
1716,"After Amazon deleted my 2 prior reviews, this one is sanitized to please Disney and their friends in the CCP. This movie, Mulan, is almost worthless, a silly retread of a Chinese fable made to appease the CCP. A watered down war movie.
Mickey Mouse puts his cheese above all else."
1717,"This is actually the first movie about Mulan I ever watched, and I liked it.
The action and effects weren't overdosed, I liked the actress who played the main character, and the final song was the best.
Most of the ""specialists"" in here forget that it's a Disney tale, it should have happy ending."
1718,People do not understand the story and give low points. This movie is amazing. The best remake by Disney. Thank you Disney I had an amazing time watching it.
1719,"Very good! Disney does it again! However, I wished the would have added the music to the important parts in the movie like the animated. Excellent costumes and special effects. Way to go Disney!!!!!"
1720,"Is it the original? Of course not! Is it an enjoyable movie that has heart and feelings and awesome throwbacks to the original?! YES! You want the original, go watch it. You want a similar movie for family movie night that is entertaining and enjoyable? Add this to the list."
1721,"I get that they were aiming for a more mature adaptation, so I can respect the removal of the comic reliefs. But this lead is very much a Mary Sue, and I have no respect for Mary Sues."
1722,"After I took my daughter to see Mulan, I asked my daughter, do you like Mulan? She said I like it. I want to have the same martial arts skills as her. She is so beautiful. How strong"
1723,"Better than most Disney movies! Scenery and action excellent! Basic storyline deviates from the cartoon, THANK GOD! Wonderful strong woman film!"
1724,"I do not know who this film is for, but it is a disaster that does not suit the times in which we live. Visually, the scenery resembles a computer background, the facial expressions are exaggerated and everything looks like a caricature. In terms of character development, there is none. Evil seeks revenge for his father, the good one wants to protect emperor, the soldier is loyal and the father is forgiving. Everything is flat as paper. The worst part is how women are treated. A Wife or A Witch. A woman without chi will not be equal to any man. A woman with chi will be subject to a superior man. It's just a disaster. I do not know who the target audience of the film is but hope they too will find it outdated and misogynist. It is unbelievable that this film was directed, produced and shot by women."
1725,The movie is a serious disappointment in every way. There are better things to watch honestly.
1726,"The best Disney live action so far! Everyone who is on the fence about watching this... WATCH IT AND HAVE YOUR OWN OPINION!! I don't agree with spending £19.99 instead of watching in cinemas where it would be outstanding but hey that's Disney for you. STOP WHINGING ABOUT THE ORIGINAL ITS NOT MEANT TO BE THE SAME!! ITS NOT 1998!! This film is beautifully filmed, incredibly directed and incredibly well acted. If you want a little Dragon making you laugh and lots of singing just watch the original. If you have an open mind and love Martial Arts its the movie for you. I'm glad Disney have finally made a live action that doesn't contain every song and taken the exact script from the original just like all the others. They definitely wanted to try and make something new and it WORKS! Best way to watch it is to just let Disney take you on a new path of film making and story telling instead of serving up the same rubbish year in and year out. If you want to see a Mulan 1998 remake then don't watch this because its not the same film its something new and ORIGINAL! If they remade every Disney film as just carbon copies they would all be pointless. WELL DONE FOR FINALLY CREATING SOMETHING ORIGINAL AND FRESH. This has restored my faith in new Disney live actions."
1727,"Even i feel there is something missed, but this is still bece one of the best disney movie
Ps. The war action i think need more"
1728,"I never saw the animated version of ""Mulan,"" but I figured I would watch the live action version. I'm always impressed with the vivid coloration and picturesque scenery of most big production Chinese movies and ""Mulan"" followed that same mold. ""Mulan"" does fall victim to a persistent theme in modern Chinese movies, and that's the theme of old tradition versus modernity. That theme has played out in many Chinese movies to varying degrees of success.""Mulan"" is about old versus new and also about bravery, sacrifice, honor, and all other traits you'd expect to see in a battle movie. In that respect, ""Mulan"" is a solid movie. For the most part it was by the numbers with the addition of a Disney budget to give us some extra cool visual effects. So, I would say that ""Mulan"" is impressive, but not a real standout."
1729,"Beautifully shot vibrant film. Classic moments but a neat new wrapping. I loved the flow of the film and the strong message of female empowerment and self love is important. Things unfold a bit differently than the original but personal I loved it, it made it feel new and exciting. The battle was awesome as well with great stunts and costumes."
1730,"This movie was made into a live-action with creativity, taste, and style.All I have to say is this:
If you loved the original, then watch this.
Open your mind to the changes that were necessary to turn an animation
into a live-action.
It was beautiful."
1731,"I never saw the animated film, so I don't hold the new live action film responsible to live up to any previous standard. That makes me, in my view, a more neutral arbiter of Mulan 2020 as a film consumer.I've read the criticisms of this film, ranging from Chinese national political involvement (listed in the film credits), alleged manipulation of the story's themes to favor the official China government propaganda about the nation, location shoots near the Uighur detention camps, the film's lead actor Liu Yifei speaking in support of China's clampdown on the Hong Kong democracy movement, and criticisms of the creative choices made in the film. While each of these items carries some weight in some perspectives, I didn't let them influence me while I watched the end-product, the film.As a standalone film, given the caveats stated above, Mulan 2020 is solid entertainment, beautifully crafted, with a positive message for the world and young people. The storyline is noble, the central character is a stoic role model, and the possible creative choice disputes can easily be overlooked by a neutral observer.Did I find the Witch problematic, design-wise, as some point out? No, not really, but I can see how she could've been expanded upon further. Except, a filmmaker has to make choices, else the movie runs on for hours.Did I find the Phoenix confusing? Perhaps. I was confused about it at first, thinking it was the Witch, but then, after a while it became more clear -- or, as clear as it was going to get. This element could've been better explained or elaborated or put in some kind of context.Was I pleased with all the casting choices and the dialogs? Mostly, but again why do we need to second guess the process of putting this film together?As to the politics that have been injected into the discussions about Mulan 2020, I'd simply point out that all film locations have some troubled history or ongoing issues, worldwide.Any films shot in the American South and parts of the East Coast are done so on land that once harbored institutionalized slavery sanctioned by the U.S. Constitution. Where's the outrage for that?Should Driving Miss Daisey have been banned or boycotted? Extending beyond entertainment, should the Judeo-Christian Bible be banned due to it's advocation of violence against our 'enemies'?I know these are not a perfect examples, but one must try to have the larger view of the world at times, and for me general entertainment should be largely exempt from some of the justified angst in society, unless (the caveat) the entertainment is blatantly a propaganda tool spreading dangerous falsehoods as truths that seek to stir up greater division and harm. Mulan 2020 does not do any of that as an entertainment product, despite any behind-the-scenes facts or nuances.My first thought as the movie ended was that I would want to watch it again some day in order to absorb more of the creative detail I might've missed. I liked it that much.Kindly spare me any angry rants and entrenched arguments. These are all just my own opinions which I believe are fair minded."
1732,It is not even comparable to cartoon movie by Disney. Big actors involved in the project but that didn't add much to the story nor the script. I can't deny the efforts made in direction and production but still as a watcher the story or at least the plot is what matters. Any thing else came later and this project failed big time in that
1733,"Don't know why this movie got such low reviews. Rented this for my family and they all loved it from the beginning to the end. Plenty of action, empowerment for young girls, and a good moral story behind it. We enjoyed it."
1734,"This movie was well made, the costumes were colourful and vibrant. The acting was superb. The cinematography was excellent. I didn't mind the story. I would suggest to see the movie your self to form your own opinion before taking someone else's."
1735,"All of these bad reviews make no sense. People are upset because the remake is different than remake, but it is an amazing reimagining. The costumes are amazing, the acting is great, and the story is excellent."
1736,The director lost path in middle of the movie. Liked the story telling part.
1737,Mulan the cartoon is funny in contrast to this one it is really boring.My kid is fond of the cartoon he was disappointed and kept asking when will Mosho show up
1738,"Disney does it again bringing another lovable animation to the live action world (good), changing a lot of lovable characters or just erasing their existence (bad), with very good action sequences (great), westernizing a culturally proud group of people (terrible), tackling the general gender value system (excellent) and finally having a short runtime (unacceptable).
I know there were issues with the film but it was not all that bad still for me I think it would have been better if it were never attempted."
1739,"I understand that the Jedi/ninja/magic aspects of the movie were a bit hard to take seriously at some points, but this movie is undeserving of such a low rating. Usually I consider a rating of 6 something that is arguably tolerable or feel-good, and a 7 is a decent quality movie that is easy to enjoy but not quite trying to be a masterpiece. This movie was right on the mark for 7, but some might consider it a 6 using my standards because it doesn't resemble the original in many ways and sometimes pushes a feminist agenda that might annoy some (I thought it was subtle enough to not feel forced or stupid). I'd definitely recommend this to anyone interested in watching it as it is far better than the live action Aladdin but not quite as good as the live action Cinderella. It's an entertaining movie, but it is by no means an accurate representation of its predecessor."
1740,I don't know why a lot of people didn't like it. I like that it's different from the cartoon story. I probably wouldn't watch It if it's the same story. I don't know why these people don't like change or surprises.
1741,"This movie just ruined the first Mulan, for me. The new plot they wrote just reminded me of this old Disney movie, Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior.The entire intro, introducing Mulan's 'chi' was unnecessary. I hated the idea of witchcraft in the story. I didn't like that the enemies' soldiers could run up walls. It just reminds me of those old asian kung fu movies. I'm not saying those movies were bad, but I just didn't like the realistic part of the story gone, like from the animated. Even the matchmaker scene where Mulan got kicked out for dealing with the spider (because her sister was afraid of it) was just ridiculous.I also wished they used a dragon instead of a phoenix to be Mulan's 'guide'. It would have been way cooler, but I guess they didn't have the budget for that. Got big bi energy from Chen.The only thing I may have liked from this film is the dramatic side of the story. Since it's a live-action of the original, I could really feel the emotions."
1742,"Stunning landscapes, great cinematography, fun storyline. What's not to like?"
1743,"I have been very unsure of these remakes but I loved Mulan. The alterations to the plot were cleverly done. The gay/trans subtext was very subtle and touching. It made me jump, I urged the characters on all the way and even shed a tear. Would recommend to anyone"
1744,"Disney's best live-action remake so far. If they had made Mulan someone who had to work for her fighting skills, instead of being born that way, it would have been better, and would show her struggle and triumph in a more believable way. Other than that it's a great spectacle with some awesome set pieces."
1745,"I've enjoyed watching Mulan. The cast, costumes, scenography, cinematography, all the stunt work and special effects... excellent!"
1746,"Absolutely Brilliant Cinema, Good action , Genuine efforts taken by all Actors..... Fantastic Direction...Must watch"
1747,"This live-action Mulan in 2020 is just not what I expected.First of all, every turning point of the character psychology lacks solid motivation: Mulan's decision of joining up the army instead of her father; giving up the disguisement and being herself during the fight; letting Mulan lead the army to save the emperor,etc. These plots did not make sense to me. I feel nothing but confusing when I saw this movie.What the most confused me is 'Qi'. I just could not figure out what the hell 'Qi' is even after I finished the whole movie. It sounds like 'the one', you know, reminding me of Neo in Matrix. I guess maybe the director would like to use some elements of traditional Chinese culture as a clue, but it didn't work. As a Chinese, I feel the misuse even makes the movie more horrible."
1748,"There is no cricket, no awesomeness of mushu and Mushu is a friggin Pheniox. Dragon trumps Phoenixs, whose stupid idea was it to get rid of Mushu??? the bird transforms into a woman or any form. Shang is not a general, but another soilder.I felt there were some interesting changes, in the movie, but over all the awesomeness I loved about Mulan, just wasnt there. The theme of the story may be similar. The story is DIFFERENT. It's very different from the animation, and it not the same."
1749,"For over a decade now, Disney has been mining their animated catalog of magical stories and remaking them into live-action movies. This trend has had its ups (the visual spectacle found within ""The Jungle Book"") and its downs (last year's joylessly photorealistic ""The Lion King""), but each one has made buckets of money for the house of mouse.Originally set to join the line of remakes back in March was ""Mulan"". For obvious pandemic reasons, that release didn't go as planned and now the film has been released straight to Disney+ at the exorbitant fee of $29.99, which is on top of your regular monthly payments. It's a price point no one should come close to thinking of paying, especially considering that the movie they are buying pales in comparison to its animated predecessor.If you've seen the original 1998 version of ""Mulan"", then you've already seen this newer adaptation as the story follows the same path.The film opens in Imperial China as we are introduced to Mulan, a young adventurous girl that is often a disappointment because she does not fit her predestined gender role. In this opening sequence, we are dazzled with all the things money can buy. At a budget of $200 million, it's no surprise that the sets are luscious, the costumes are pristine, and the makeup is vibrant.Further illustrating the power of money is the locations used by director Niki Caro and cinematographer Mandy Walker. The duo beautifully gives life to the rural and urban landscapes, even if some moments can be ruined by an overabundance of computer effect meddling.After an invasion by the villainous Böri Khan, the emperor conscripts an army made up of one man per family. Unfortunately for Mulan's family, the only man is their war-wounded father who surely will not survive. Under the cover of night, Mulan takes her father's gear and sets out in his place for the army. Upon reaching the training grounds, we are introduced to the lot of supporting characters, first of which is Commander Tung. The rest of the gang are younger lads that only possess one character trait to set them apart.The training sequence is where Caro exemplifies her chops as a director. She creates bold imagery that gives off a sense of power and courage. Caro also injects a bit of wuxia (a Chinese action genre that suspends physics in favor of more fantastical action) into the action. Even if it is over-edited, the stunt work is something to admire as elaborate set pieces are constructed in various interesting locations.And while it's no ""I'll Make a Man Out of You"", composer Harry Gregson-Williams does deliver a terrifically epic score to punctuate the action scenes.What clouds over this newest version of ""Mulan"" and negates many of its accomplishments is the shocking lack of fun within the movie. Stripping itself of the musical numbers and talking animals, and then adding on a dour tone about warfare doesn't make for a very inspirational or entertaining time. Of course, a war movie doesn't have to be all sunshine and rainbows, but it's next to impossible to take this movie seriously when there's an identical bright, animated version that's superior in nearly every way.Chinese star Yifei Lu plays the titular character with both grace and ferocity. She expertly tackles the language barrier and carries the majority of the film's emotional weight on her shoulders. Her interactions with her father (brilliantly played by Tzi Ma) are the highlights.Playing a new character in the story is Gong Li as the conflicted witch Xianniang. She's as mysterious as the dark side of the moon and often toes the line between hero and villain with her inventive powers. It's a shame that she and Jason Scott Lee's Böri Khan were given little to work with.Chinese megastars Donnie Yen and Jet Li play Commander Tung and Emperor, respectively. Yen and Li lend star power to their minor supporting roles, which was probably the only reason they were cast.The newest version of ""Mulan"" is a passable film that fares better than most of the assembly line remakes that have preceded it. But at the same time, it still falters to the original and lacks the entertaining bite that has never been in short supply within Disney films. At the high price required to view it, the best option would be to wait until Dec. 4, when the movie is available at no extra cost to Disney+ subscribers."
1750,"Greatbmove.
the girl became a soldier💂💂
the soldier became a leader 👸👸
and the leader 👸
became a legend ❤❤"
1751,"This is a live REMAKE. When will Disney realise that a remake means making something similar to the original. Mulan was a film we grew up watching. And now it is a live action movie that has been ruined.I like that Jet Li was considered.
If they can add a Phoenix, the can add Mushu."
1752,"My 10 is to the great cast of this movie.
Yifei Liu was the absolute best choice for this character. Just like how I wanted Emma Watson to be Belle and my wish came true, the same thing happened here and I'm so happy and grateful....
BUT....as much as i completely understood that Live action remake would take a different path to the story and have it's own color and had no expectation neither wanted to see the same animated movie, because live action is not a cartoon.....ME being a huge fan of Chinese culture from childhood, growing up watching movies, reading, following the culture... I SURELY expected to see some real passion put into making of this movie....Especially having the actress I wanted playing this legendary character.... SHE WAS GREAT IN EVERY ASPECT! BUT...As much as i loved it and my heart was warm....I also felt empty.... because of how much potential is lost in this picture....
I expected to feel closer to the actual legend of Mulan.... feel more history....accurately told....but it didn't happen.
still enjoyed it.... but having Yifei Liu being so great and strong in character i surely hoped for the directer to understand this story and it's real power more... because the actors GAVE IT ALL to what they had to work with.... so my 10 is to the CAST!"
1753,"200 million dollars. Let that sink in people. 200 million dollars. WTF did I just watch? The plot is nothing short of pathetic, the actress is soooo bad and don't get me started on the script. In the original, Mulan was a flawed character who wasn't better than her male counterparts but actually a bit worse than them. But she worked hard and used intelligence, will and grit to be the best. This movie however shows no moral values whatsoever. Its almost as if disney thought that a woman fighting amongst men is unrealistic, so they gave her superpowers. i dont care what you call it, its basically just superpowers.And why was the witch even added? To show two strong female characters? WHAT?! This is just another sad graduate of disney's school of 'Girls who are awesome because they're girls'. It happened with Starwars, it happened with Captain Marvel, so you best believe this isnt the end. Its time we get angry with the entertainment industry for replacing originality and good story telling with politics and the desire to make money instead of focusing on good, authentic and moral writing. It doesnt help that the target audience is young people, it just doesnt. It sends a wrong message, basically saying that you dont to work hard cause you were born awesome. Trust me, that's not how life works. This movie is makes Captain Marvel look like a masterpiece."
1754,"If the purpose of this film was to take away every single good thing about the original and ruin it as much as possible with bad ideas, well then mission accomplished. It is extremely boring and not funny, has very low production value and fails in almost every deaprtment so it is just overall terrible. Do not waste your time.A live action remake of a Disney classic that nobody asked for."
1755,"Mulan is a live action reimagining of the 1998 animated Disney film of the same name, which itself is an adaptation of the Chinese folk story ""The Ballad Of Mulan"". Directed by Niki Caro (Whale Rider, The Zookeeper's Wife), it takes a beloved modern classic of Disney animation and bleeds it dry of virtually everything that was fun and interesting about it in the first place.In Ancient China, invading warriors to the north led by Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) threaten the life of its Emperor (Jet Li) and the rest of the country's citizens. To hold them off, the Emperor issues a notice of conscription with the requirement that each Chinese family must contribute one male member to fight back against the invaders. Knowing her ailing father would not stand a chance against this threat, the young and adventurous Hua Mulan (Yifei Liu) decides to go against her family's wishes and take his place, disguising herself as a man and training hard until she is physically ready to do battle with the enemy.Even after more than twenty years, I still feel that the original 1998 film holds up extremely well, thanks to its wonderfully written main character, beautiful hand drawn art style, catchy songs, and universal themes centring on honouring family tradition and standing for the right cause. ""Mulan 2020"", however, simply feels like the current head on this proverbial chopping block of decent-to-mediocre live action adaptations of animated Disney films. Less than ten minutes in, I was taken aback at how soulless and uninteresting this version was. All of the fun moments and lovable quirks that made the original such a joy to watch are jarringly absent here, replaced instead with musicless training montages, generic war battles, bland supporting characters, and a female lead who looked so emotionless that it is hard to determine if she even cares about what is going on around her. I'm not entirely sure if this was all a creative decision to make us take this film more seriously or if it was just a way to compromise the original story to suit Chinese audiences, but considering Disney's business practice of shilling out to China as a means to bring in more box office revenue, I'd be leaning more towards the latter.In terms of direction, there's nothing special here. It's all paint-by-the-numbers in its execution and leaves very little to the imagination. This is somewhat surprising because its director Niki Caro is certainly more than qualified to have handled subject matter like this. Her 2002 film ""Whale Rider"" dealt with the theme of a girl proving herself to be just as worthy as the boys in a leadership role, which certainly echoes similarities to the character of Hua Mulan. Why this couldn't be replicated here is unconfirmed but I am once again inclined to place the blame on Disney's tailoring to Chinese tastes as the main reason.Additionally, the cinematography left a lot to be desired, as it too was relatively unimpressive. Instead of the gorgeous sweeping shots of Ancient China and all its architectural accomplishments seen in the original, there are instead a bland still images with an establishing caption at the bottom of the screen. Epic shots of armies marching towards each other are now replaced with five second cuts of soldiers walking past obvious green screen backgrounds. This made it near impossible for me to be truly immersed into this era as I think it comes across as lazy and cost-cutting (this film had a budget of US$200 million so there's no excuse for this kind of lax approach). I will admit the musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams was one of the few things I actually enjoyed about this film, along with some creative choices in costume design, but that isn't enough to redeem the entire picture from the rest of its faults.The only member of the cast who left something of an impression on me was its main star Yifei Liu in the title role, not because her performance is particularly memorable, but because she is the only character given any real development. Every other member of the supporting cast felt like they were there to either spout exposition or make our heroine look good when a scene required it. I missed the wisecracks of the dragon Mushu and the implied romantic feelings Mulan felt for her Captain in the original, as these gave that film so much more personality and charm. Throughout this film, Mulan's emotions ranged from either looking scared to looking poker faced. Even scenes where she was crying didn't look convincing enough to leave an impact. On a more positive note, I do think she did resemble a man when she was dressed up as one, due to how androgynous some of her fellow cadets looked alongside her, so at least that was believable.In conclusion, it seems kind of pointless to continue complaining about Disney remaking all of their older films in live action as it is going to keep happening regardless. What creative liberties they'll end up taking with each film will vary of course as China has a strict code of practice that needs to be followed. I have created my own quality spectrum for Disney remakes with Mulan 2020 being at the end of the ""Too Different"" side and The Lion King 2019 being on the end of ""Too Similar"" side. If I had to pick a film for the middle, I'd probably say The Jungle Book 2016, as I believe it had the right balance of difference and similarity to its animated counterpart. With that in mind, if Disney remakes stick too closely to either end, I'd say we're in for a bumpy ride over the next few years.I rate it 4/10"
1756,"I did not have any expectations for Mulan but that is because I did not even know that the director is Niki Caro, who brought to Hollywood the youngest Oscar Best Actress nominee ever, Keisha Castle Hughes, in Whale Rider (2002). Whale Rider and Mulan, while two entirely different genre, have something in common, the story of a woman (a girl, technically speaking) in a male-dominating universe trying to do things a woman is not supposed to do. Both bring wrath to their most beloved, a grandfather and a father, respectively. Both finish in triumph, getting the recognition they deserve and reconciling with their family. One more thing. Both movies have a symbolic creature, a whale and a phoenix, respectively.
I am not going to dwell on the plot as it is adapted from a popular Disney animation with the same title. Not having seen the original animation, I am in no position to assess how closely the live-actors version adheres to the animated original.
Mulan strives on being thoughtful, measured, level-headed and sincere. It gently brings across its main agenda without crafty, manipulative emotions. For a mainstream entertainment, the action sequences are well choreographed, satisfying. LIU Yifei carries the lead capably, following the general direction of Caro is heading, sometimes to the extent of underacting, which I say as a compliment. Donnie YEN and Jet LI, while not exactly cameos, are there obviously to boost the box office take, with paint-by-number roles. Truly shining is GONG Li who, as the main villain, provides the best acting in portrayal of a character that has depth and layers.
There are tributes to other movies and TV series aplenty. The first appearance of Gong's character, emerging at a far distance from a sea of mists in a desert reminds you immediately of a similarly stunning scene in Lawrence of Arabia. When the phoenix's wings spread out from behind Mulan as if they are her own, you could almost see Danny with Dragon in the finale of Game of Thrones. The mysterious substance (for want of a better name) ""Chi"" must be a distant cousin of ""the force"" that is present in both the good (Jedi and Mulan) and the evil (Sith Lords and Gong's character).
Finally, a small bonus, as I am an ""Agents of Shield"" fan, is a blink-and-you-miss appearance of WEN Ming-na."
1757,"Wow. This film did not disappoint! Myself and some friends watched this in the cinema and were really impressed. Do not expect a like for like comparison to the original, and understand that some of the original songs won't work in this more serious tone of a movie.
Watching this movie in today's day and age where we are in an active discussion to remind and show girls and women the social and cultural constraints placed on them, I think it really resonated with us and we felt inspired and left us with fire in our bellies!
The lead actress was awesome, along with the rest of the cast, and the filmography was great.
Please don't go off the 1 star reviews, a lot of these are people comparing to the original, or frankly ticked off they had to pay extra on Disney+. If you can find peace that this version is 'in addition' to the original, (not to replace it) then you can appreciate it as a stand alone, great movie."
1758,Well how is this based on Disney's Mulan? 🤔 Completely different and bad actors... Big disappointment.
1759,"The worst live-action movie produced bye Disney. Poor story, mediocre characters, it's completely different to 98's version. Not recommendable to see."
1760,"This is such a bad movie from every angle, out of 2 hundred million dollars? This shows how pathetic and out of touch Disney is. I wish there were negative ratings."
1761,"There are quite a few things wrong with this live action version on multiple levels. Instead of writing in paragraph form, I'll just list them out numerically, in no particular order:1. Mulan possesses some other worldly super power that we are supposed to buy. I felt toyed with with this contrivance.2. The extras are poorly directed ~ they gander, gawk, look overly surprised, overact even in distant shots, and point their fingers at the subjects with baffling implausibility.3. The vivid colors are beautiful to look out, but seem to have a high degree of vibrance to hide the artificial backdrops and less than stellar CGI.4. Mulan looks far too feminine around the regiment, and the soldier love interest is way overplayed, as if he already knows her secret. He seems to be catering to her femininity. At one point he gets a good look at her upper backside while she swims in all its feminine curvature, and doesn't notice in the slightest.5. Mulan gets off the hook too easily when her deception is discovered. Seems too Disney friendly. Prior to the discovery, there's also a poor edited scene with her hair down and flowing in the midst of battle, and there's not a single shot of a reaction from a soldier to take notice of this.I did like the actress, who isn't a traditional beauty by any conventional standard. She carries the film well, and does not try to look too angry and tough in close up. There are some heart tugging moments that she handles well enough.Skip this and rewatch the original animated version."
1762,"I saw the movie 2 days ago, it is really a good one, deserves better rating."
1763,"The Movie:
The acting is good each character played fine.
Mulan herself is strong and confident and a great role model for inspiration.
Cinematography was very good with the landscapes however some scenes such as the pots falling in slow mo seemed a bit off but great job all round.
It has a great message about standing up against social problems / inequality.
Action scenes were entertaining and excited some of the moves like the huns running on the walls was weird but most scenes were well done.
Music was nice and reminiscent of the original.The Bad Stuff:
Most complaints are that it doesn't have the songs or mushu, however the original was offensive to the chinese audience.The pricing as well is overpriced $35? You can see a movie at the cinema for $15 and that's on top of a subscription.Overall:
I didn't have a problem with the movie it's a solid 7 personally and 8 for me. This is my first ever movie review, go easy on me 😅"
1764,"After many years of being 'just an IMDB passive reader'.... I've decided to...... congratulate Disney!!!... you step up to the next level of 'cartoon stories' made in the form of the movie. What a great step forward.For sure small kids should start with the cartoon version but for those who love the old one.. like me... this new Mulan is a great return to the old story in a complete new way.Mulan 2020 even if not perfect... I can't understand those who rated the movie - 1!!!!Beautiful story, well acted, shot and told....Don't read bad comments.... just watch and find what is beautiful about this art.Ps
It may be interesting but i HATE super hero movies.... but this one is not the case.It is a piece of art.Enjoy!"
1765,"The worst Disney movie. No character development. No songs in the movie, no humors."
1766,"What is Mulan ? It is the empowering tale of an average woman prepared to live as a good home wife that joins the army in order to save her old dad from certain death. Using wits, determination and artifices she saves the emperor.
At least that was the original tale. Who would have thought that a post ""me too"" movie made by a woman would loose its soul and deliver the message that a woman needs super powers to be the hero of this story.That is the most disappointing aspect but then not the only one. Acting and scripts are cheasy as possible, special effects and fights worst than a 1970s wuxia movie and instead of laughing with the movie we are laughing at it.
The stupidest scene of the movie is when mulan closes the gate of the palace walls, while about all warriors in the movie can walk on the walls ! That's just one of many inconsistancies and aberrations of this parody.
The only praise would go to the set design and costumes."
1767,"I was ready to see a new take on Mulan, different than the classic we grew up with, I wasn't ready for this movie.
Mulan inspires people to be better and show that everything is possible as long as you work for it. However, this ""Mulan"" has no character development whatsoever, she starts stronger than the other characters and everything she accomplishes looks effortless.
You love Disney magic? Great! In here you have no gravity, witchcraft, Lord of the Rings Legola's double-arrow, packed with non plausible physics. Who needs bows when you can shoot arrows with your feet? Who needs ladders when you can just run up the walls?
I already knew that some characters wouldn't make it to the movie but making Mushu a Phoenix and turning Mulan's Grandmother into a sister, that added nothing to the storyline, did not change the movie for the better. The characters that remained were bland and boring, including Mulan herself.
Well I guess we shouldn't expect better from 2020, however you could've stayed true to the original..."
1768,Absolutely amazing loved it!!! 💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
1769,"The plot is unlogical and main actress is really emotionless, the worst thing is there is no song in the movie, this is the first time a disney princess dont sing ant song"
1770,"Missing too many important characters! I mean come on! I grew up on this movie. As a kid who watched this at least twice a week for years, a kid who memorized the whole movie word for word: this is not Mulan.No music
No Singing
No Mushu
No grandma
No Shang
No cricket
No ancestorsMissing half of the characters!
Added a sisterAll the Disney magic from the cartoon was left out. Highly disappointed. Every scene was cut short.
Mulan's character was a bit dry for me, she didn't have the firey spirit like in the cartoon. She didn't speak much either. It was a good action movie but if you're doing a rendition of Mulan, the mark was totally missed."
1771,"I was excited for this movie from the moment I first saw a trailer back in February. Then of course pandemic struck, theaters closed, releases got cancelled. Well, I finally got to see it and I must say, it fulfilled all my high expectations.This was much better than the cartoon version. I liked the cartoon version a lot. It was really cute and funny. This had a more serious tone, but was ultimately a far better movie. The scenery was, in a word, stunning. The fight scenes were awesome. I loved everything about the witch, from her character arc to her fighting skills to the actress they chose. Also, I was glad they left out the musical numbers-having characters randomly burst into song is hard to get right without seeming a little corny.This was gorgeous in 4K but I still wish I could have seen it on the big screen."
1772,A Disney movie without singing... My little daughter didn't like it...
1773,"Nothing compared to the original. Less fun, less rewarding, no growth. Blegh..."
1774,"Average acting.
Story slow in parts, the everything happens all at once, which was why the character development was weak.
Audio disappointing.The visual effects and cinematography were the only positive areas."
1775,"Watched this movie with an open mind and heart, deciding not to compare it with the original. Ended up with these opinions:Cheap, fake-looking CGI scenes. Spears and arrows are kicked around like footballs, defying gravity.
Characters lack depth (e.g. Mulan's sister, troop ""friends""). Villains - unconvincing, NPC-like, similar to imperial guards.
Character development lacking: Mentions of ""chi"" almost like a superhero-like power. Effort, teamwork and kindness, is thrown out the window. Mulan is a warrior born flexible, active, and able to defy gravity.
Final thoughts: Disappointing and messy. I often felt befuddled, wondering what the whole intention of the movie was. Feminism, equality? Loyalty? Honesty? Honor? Too touch-and-go, and vague."
1776,"Thia movie is such as rubbish , everything is bad, the writer and director dont know what is chinese amd chinese culture. And where is the little dragon !?!are you crazy? he is one of the important character. I lobe disney but I hate this movie."
1777,"Never watched any other Mulan, and try not to judge a movie based on another movie. I liked this movie's heart."
1778,"Poor story
Poor characters
Poor music
Poor flowI hope Disney can reconsider of not filming these kind of films in the future"
1779,"Poor direction, charectors, vfx, story and lot more but I didn't have any good things to say about this movie. I expected a good movie after watching the trailer but it is a disaster. you can just watch it once without any expectations."
1780,"It's weird how they got rid of the best character and diverse black played part: Mushu. The story was terrible, completely uncaptivating and boring. Everything good about the original was taken out. The acting and dialogue was so bad as well. Extremely confused how this has the Disney name on it."
1781,"Watcher101 - "" Uch, it was bad. And I had high hopes for this one, at least as an action film. But nope, it was an all around mess. First of all, it's Woke (of course it is), but that's only the start of the problems. Sometimes they have lame fighting styles, other times they just randomly throw in something out of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and not in a good way, but it's all really boring. They also took out all the interesting characters, like Mushu, Shang, Cricket, Mulan's grandmother, Mulan's 3 army friends, and instead we get these pointless nobodies who have little to no role other than simply being there. They even gave Mulan a sister, but she adds absolutely nothing; you can take her out of the movie and it changes nothing. Oh, and there's no Shan Yu either, instead we get these two generic, boring villains with no character. And let's not forget the inclusion of chi and actual magic and witchcraft. And, of course, Mulan is an overpowered Mary Su who, even as a child, was performing moves that would put Jacki Chan to shame. I mean, why not give her actual development in training and stuff to show her becoming a good fighter when you can just make her super OP Mary Sue right off the bat, right? The acting itself is bland, and even the dialogue is horrible. Everyone talks in these tone-deaf monotone voices with no emotion in them. You really feel nothing for any these characters. The movie has none of the charm of the original, and they don't even have any of the songs. Seriously, the movie is an utter disaster, and completely boring. They would have been better off doing a shot-for-shot remake like they did with the live-action Lion King. Get your act together, Disney, you're sinking your own ship."""
1782,"Original Mulan is one of my favourite Disney movies and I had high expectation for the remake. I knew that there have been many changes from the original but I was not prepared for this mess.
First of all, film completely misses the point of Mulan and robs it of any character development. Instead of pushing through the adversities and using creative approach to become a warrior Mulan starts of as genius, Shao ling monk acrobat.
Villains were turned from fierce bloodthirsty army into black Naruto style magician ninjas (they literally run vertically up the wall) who look like assassins.
The longer I was watching the more ridiculous film become with sudden character changes, non logical plot points, absolutely horrible ""final boss"" fight and changed ending that undermines the whole point that Mulan was trying to make.
Cinematically film looked stunning with some absolutely beautiful shots. And that is the only redeeming quality of this film."
1783,"It's not because I had high expectations. You never have high expectations for disney live action; you're suppose to be pleasantly surpluses by how well they end up making it. But this time around, they failed horribly. No character development. No love between mulan and fellow soldiers. And worst of all.. Hollywood's need to check off every box of the liberal agenda ruined the movie. It's already an empowering storyline, why do you have to go over the top to make it less genuine???"
1784,"Purchased the movie in support of rare occasion of an all Asian cast on the big screen, but my feeling towards the movie itself went from disappointing to angry.The culture relevance is very forced. The makeup, costumes, the word Qi, the poorly made phoenix CGI made me feel like the director put together a hodgepodge of all the Chinese symbols that the western world has ever heard about and forced them into a movie. The shallow understanding of the culture is truly embarrassing to watch.Next time when you make a movie and leverage a different culture as the backdrop, please do your homework, Disney."
1785,"Bad acting, cheesy without being better than the original."
1786,"Let's start with the good. The visuals. In a few scenes.... Yeah, that's about it. Going into the film I knew characters from the original were missing however I did not know that they would be replaced with a shapeshifter because that makes sense. Acting wasnt great. Some scenes that either defy gravity or were just so unrealistic made me cringe throughout the film. Luckily I did not have to pay the ridiculous $30usd to see it or I would've been more upset about how awful it was. I felt like it was a late 80s international film. Only thing missing was the English voice overs that never match up with the actors. It was that bad"
1787,"Disney USED to be great. However when they decided to force themselves into more markets they lost. You can see that in their work now. The movies coming out now are just empty remnants of what used to be amazing stories or films. Maybe they should just take a step back and take a break. South park hit the nail on the head with disneys spiral downwards. This movie had no character development and alot of changes from the original animated. If you are going to fork money out to see this, do yourself a favor and just buy the original. It is very unfortunate. I was looking very forward to seeing this movie. Just stop Disney. Clearly you don't have your castle in order like you used to."
1788,"Boring acting, it reminded me of a typical Chinese film. The original was fabulous the actors exciting. This remake bored me to tears."
1789,"Mulan has arrived, not at cinemas as originally planned but instead as the first film in what will likely become a library of Premier Subscription titles. As the latest live action remake of an animated classic this will naturally draw comparisons with the 1998 original Disney movie.
If you're looking for nostalgia, songs and animal sidekicks then go for the 1998 version. If you're looking for a more adult offering with battles and a discussion of duty and sacrifice then the 2009 version is for you.
This Mulan is a story about embracing yourself, it's full of subtle and not so subtle imagery and honours the story of Mulan while also providing a film that isn't just a rehash of the animated original.
There is still stylised choreography, excellent wire work and great set pieces as the Chinese army take on the Rouran. Mulan, the brave daughter of Zhou, takes her father's place in the army to save his life. She wrestles with hiding her true identity as she trains to help save China.
This story is about two women, Mulan and the witch Xianniang, both women having been forced to hide who they truly are. Xianniang allowed it to torment her, driving her to seek validation with the armies of Borï Khan who dislike and distrust her as much as the Chinese but see her as a useful weapon. Mulan refuses to accept this fate and instead risks everything to embrace her true self, understanding that it will enable her to unlock her full potential but also doom her to dishonour and possible death as she seeks to save China.
Mulan is protected and guided by the Phoenix, a powerful Chinese symbol of grace, virtue, balance and harmony. The bird guides her through to her acceptance of her true self and symbolically follows her when she accepts her destiny.
It's a wonderful film and an empowering interpretation of the story for young girls. The action scenes are exciting but not graphic and the performances are great. There are also some lovely nods to the original such as the character Cricket, one of the soldiers Mulan meets.
Yifei Liu is excellent as Mulan and the film is certainly enhanced by her doing the majority of her own stunts. Donnie Yen gives a powerful performance as Commander Tung, Tzi Ma and Rosalind Chao are wonderful as Mulan's parents and both Jason Scott Lee and Li Gong are solid villains.
There is great rewatch value in this film and I'm sure repeat viewings will reveal more subtleties. In my opinion it is the second best Disney live action after Jungle Book and well worth the money for the Premium Subscription."
1790,"Like Alita Battle Angel, the movie was excellent from start to finish. Great story, great acting and great direction. I highly recommend this movie. Having said that, it is a little intense for children, but no blood as it's a Disney movie. I hope there is a sequel."
1791,"I was reading all these negative reviews before watching, so I went into it with low expectations.
About my Disney remake experience so far: watched original Aladdin as a kid, and I still find it incredible, with great script and amazing soundtrack; on the other hand I couldn't watch more than 30 minutes of the remake which was unimaginative, complete cringe, garbage renditions of the original songs, Smith's genie was a sort of a ghetto joke,.. To say the least, I found it to be the most cringe thing I've seen in a while.
When I saw they were remaking Mulan, I expected another uninspired money-grabbing cringefest from Disney, but instead we got teen oriented kungfu flick that stands far enough from the original not to feel uninspired but fresh, there were no musical scenes that are such a great part of Disney animations but turn cringe when done in live action movies (case in point- Aladdin 2019) and I commend the director for avoiding it. There is some renditioned soundtrack from the original Mulan in this movie, just a taste of it, that gives that sense of nostalgia to anyone that watched animation as a kid; I would have preferred more of the original soundtrack, I was especially interested to hear rendition of the song I'll make a man out of you, but I guess we're gonna have to wait for that until the next remake, which should be coming in next 10-15 years (because Disney, ofc).
There are a lot of things wrong with this movie if you care to look for it: plotholes, plot armor, some cringe moments, some problems with script dialogue at points and editing blunders, some cliche moments etc. that is if you look for it.But...if you're watching this for entertainment value, I think it's definitely the best Disney live-action remake so far, and great action and message far outweighs the cringe, which is something I thought I could never again say about a product of Disney.Definitely recommended."
1792,I was expecting this to be good after seeing the 2009 movie. But this one is a garbage.
1793,"$200 million dollars to faithfully recreate the cheap Chinese movies of the 60s & 70s, totally insane, whoever greenlighted this farce was probably smoking the tea instead of drinking it, this should have been titled ""widow twanky in China"" total joke of a movie"
1794,I loved the movie overall and enjoyed the fact that I didn't know what was going to happen. It's nice to see they didn't make it exactly like the animated movie Mulan. There was nothing to complain about.
1795,Yes it is not typical Disney musical but I like this brand new approach of Disney and the visuals are so good! Love the interaction of Hua family. So touching. Whole cast did an amazing job!
1796,"Ok. The only word i can think of after watching this was OK. Yeah it did not feel anything like the animated version but honestly, I'd take anything at the moment given circumstances. Was an ok family film."
1797,"It's not a bad movie but I would suggest you save yourself $29.99 and wait until it comes out on tv or some other viewing platform.
It had very limited action moments, seemed very unrealistic at times, reminded of graphics from a classic movie.The actor the plays Mulan does great, I feel she could've done better."
1798,"I've just finished it and I think it may have been written by the propaganda department at China headquarters. This is drivel. Why Disney expect audiences to pay a premium on a streaming subscription for this is unimaginable. Watch the animation, it's 10 times better."
1799,"I'm not sure what all the bad reviews are about but I really enjoyed it!Were there a few plot changes? (Ex: no mushu, no singing, added villian characters, etc.) Yes. But the plot stayed true to the original. A young girl who doesnt fit into the traditional role of a ""proper wife"" and instead chooses to protect her family bringing them honor by breaking the mold and becoming a warrior.The cinematography was beautiul and the actions scenes were well done. I heard a few lines from the original too, which I quite enjoyed (as a true disney kid myself).Don't believe all the bad reviews. I think it is one of the better live action films that Disney has done and definitely think it is worth watching.Enjoy!"
1800,"The good: great cast, nice visual shots and cinematographyThe bad: the screenplay was total crap. Worse than crap.Spoilers:
-Scenes that were meaningful and funny in Mulan are nowhere to be found. I could deal with no Mushu, but replacing it with a phoenix that randomly shows up and float about? Ugh.-They replaced the grandmother with a sister, which adds nothing to the film.-They added a new villain, the witch, which could have been completely omitted. I see that they attempted to do something cool and interesting to make it different from the original. It failed miserably.-Scenes were rushed. We hardly got to see the soldiers really bond. Ling, Yao, and Chien Po have few lines and are forgotten quickly. Their progress doesn't really evolve into anything better from the film scenes. Mulan doesn't earn the respect of the others like she did in the original.-they cut Shang's character into two, which messes up the storyline and doesn't hold any emotional weight when they find the village is burned. It lacked any meaningful scenes. In the original, Shang finds his father has died and a doll is left behind. They take the time to mourn.-Mulan and her love interest don't share any meaningful scenes together.-the whole ""chi"" theme doesn't add anything because it seems like it was thrown in. ""Mulan has chi. She is a good fighter. When she lies about being a man, it makes her weak. "" It just makes it more convoluted.-stupid cliches in the film. ""4 ounces can carry 1000 pounds.""
-omitting all the meaningful lines that worked (cherry blossom adversity, the mountain doesn't bow to the wind)
-construction fighting scene, not even gonna go into detail about how bad the whole setup was. Basically, the villain captured the emperor and tied him up. He sets up a hot vat and plans to melt the emperor.I would rather have had them make the film exactly like the original than have them crap on everything that was good about it."
1801,"I don't know but I was expecting more fun and joy, instead I get serious story, ungry evil faces and depressed characters... Visually stunning? Not really. You need to see other Chinese visually made movies. Boy Mulan still for me was feminine... It's good movie for Release Digitally in streaming services... Good for Cinema Theatrical release? I don't think so."
1802,Some of the scenes are visually beautiful but the story sucks and is probably the worst live-action remake Disney has made so far.
1803,"Mulan..the original Mulan was my favorite Disney movie growing up. Still is. The reason I loved it so much is because Mulan; a regular girl took her fathers place to save his life, even though she had a huge disadvantage. With no experience as a fighter, AND NO POWER, she went anyway because of bravery and honor and even though she struggled she still worked twice as hard as the men around her to become the best she could be. The fact that they felt that a woman had to have some sort of fighting power in order to outshine a bunch of men, saddens me greatly. I felt like she barely had to put in any effort at all. It ruined the movie for me comepletely. So I'm going to go pretend that the original Mulan movies are the ONLY Mulan movies and forget that this one was made. $30.00 wasted."
1804,They tried but not even close or better than the original.
1805,"Mulan makes The ""Martha"" Scene from Batman vs. superman looks like a masterpiece."
1806,Very lacking emotional movie. Felt like the last 30 mins was the only major push of the film. The lacking of even basic music In scenes was apparent and the connection from the original was only there by basic plot path. Honestly I'm extremely disappointed. It didn't feel like a Disney movie or even Mulan. Just a bad knock of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. 😢
1807,"Guess this proves (to me) that good animated movies do not necessarily make good movies. There's some decent scenes but most make me cringe at best. To address the controversy, if this really is made for the Chinese market then maybe it's not even a bad thing that most western viewers dislike it, hope they really enjoy this movie there.My verdict: If you really enjoyed the other live-action remakes then watch it! Otherwise you'd be better off spending your money and time on something else."
1808,"In 1 sentence:
If you like all the new Disney remakes where they squiz any part of nostalgia out of you and remove all the magic that made Disney Disney,
so you will love this movie.Also if your among the 5% who know the real folklore story of mulan before Disney changed it, you will also love this movie as it follows the ""real"" or should i say the ""authentic"" story much closely.but there was a reason Disney changed the real story the way they did !
Disney took the original story and added what i can only describe as ""magic"" in it. bright colors, love story, music, and fun.
so yea.. NONE of these exists in this one.I had so much hope for this movie as a huge Mulan fanbut really Disney should have really kept it unpublished, as ad least i would think it's amazing.This story is just the folklore story of Mulan and lacks all the magic that Disney put to make that story pop and amazing.
if you want a real drama just watch any other story that follows a folklore tale there is 9999 better movies that does that (hell there is even 152 movies for Hansel and Gretel that tries to follow the ""real"" folklore and i'm ashamed to say some of them are better then this one).it was Obviously set for cinema with huge sound parts that can come out as amazing if you would hear them with a surround system in full volume on a 10m screen, but come out as a bit flat on normal TV with normal sound.
same goes for the amazing effects, that just look as normal effects in normal lcd screens.so what you get when you watch it at home is:
a medicare movie with good effects, ok songs and decent acting... nothing more, and def. not worth the 30 usd .yea if i would see it in the cinema i would get
great songs in surrounds, with great detailed effects, and just a fun way to pass 90m. and maybe worth the 8usd cinema ticket.so for home ? 3\10 easy .
for cinema ? maybe 6\10 as it has enjoyment in it."
1809,"A very mediocre one.Cant understand the high critic ratings. A 1998 animation is far far better than this soulless one.Plot is very bland and flat, and visually not spectacular. A TV level movie. Certainly not worth extra 30 dollars."
1810,"I absolutely love the original mulan movie and was very excited for this one. The trailer gave me the idea that it would be a more mature version of the original, considering that there would be no songs and sadly no Mushu.. However this movie wasn't in my opinion much more mature than the original. It is clearly still very much a children's movie. Which is fine however it doesn't in my opinion fit in the way this movie is portrayed now. I missed the fun parts and I didn't connect with the characters at all. Also it was obviously meant to be on the big screen. So watching it at home was less of an experience. Not worth my money, but I would have watched it anyway. Maybe my expectations were to high but I was disappointed after seeing the movie...."
1811,"Let me first say that the original Disney's Mulan is my favourite Disney movie (and that's a tough call). So I was expecting to totally hate this one. But.... it's not terrible. It is absolutely beautiful to watch - the costumes and sets are amazing. The storyline is... decent. I am disappointed that the Mulan in this story has skill, unlike the original hero who had to work hard and use her brain to earn her place and conquer the bad guys. I prefer that role model. I'm also devastated that the songs from the original weren't included. However, if you watch it as it's own movie, not comparing it, it's pretty good. They could have put a bit more into character development, but overall, it's a good family action that encourages loyalty, courage and truth."
1812,"For someone who grew up watching the original mulan on repeat, this remake mulan is something I will definitely rewatch. Yeah it didn't have mushu or any singing but I think if it did it would ruin it completely. I love the direction they made for this movie! The made mulan strong from the beginning and they didn't have to ""make a man out of her"" This is such an empowering movie for women! 10/10 for me!"
1813,You can tell a great war story without any blood (if you exclude those three drops). A story greater than life by the movie greater than any reviewer's opinion.My new favorite song: Christina Aguilera - Loyal Brave True (Mulan end theme).
1814,"Yes, trust the bad review, my friend.This movie is soulless. The script and all the dialogues is so bad and it is really annoyed me. The fight scene is so ugly yet they called it an action movie!Everything about this movie just seems so wrong for me.But well, watch at your own risk."
1815,"One important story line: Loyal, Brave & True have been scripted very perfectly into the movie from opening to ending. Please note this is PG-13 Disney movie and the Director have done an outstanding work in telling us the story. After all, this is PG-13 movie and not history telling or documentary about the story line. A very entertainment movie to inform us these 3 virtues and ending with 4 virtues."
1816,"Its a great movie, it has great visual, acting, and emotional moments. The story is great in its simplicity and the fighting scenes where very fun and well done. The problem I keep seeing is that if your a fan of Disney animated movies, you will end up hating the none animated ones. From what I could tell, the people I watched it with where all about the songs and music. In my opinion I liked it better because it didn't have singing and all that normal Disney stuff."
1817,"One of the most beautiful war movies I've ever seen, even topped with full points from me"
1818,"Wow, just wow. Very well written, well directed, well acted and well done. I see the reviewers who are upset it didn't have mushu and the other cartoon gods and I loved the Mulan cartoons. That said, I'm an adult and like to see an adult movie. If you are an adult and like the cartoon then watch the movie. This is not a remake of the cartoon. It is a retailing of a great tale for adults. 10 out of 10 in every way."
1819,"Disney took out all the cringy racism and made this into a full blown Chinese martial arts movie. I missed some of the songs, but adding those would have been corny. This was not a musical. The style is similar to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, so expect supernatural abilities and lack of physics. I've watched it twice now and will definitely watch it again."
1820,I am not a movie critics and I love this movie. It's beautiful and memorable. The only part I complained was the ending which fell short of the fighting scenes but overall this is a great movie to watch. Every cast especially Mulan and her father did not disappoint you. I am Asian so trust me none of the China productions or remake of Mulan can give you this quality. Watch it!
1821,"I have never seem Mulan before and I didn't even know the story but still enjoyed it for entertainment's sake. Good acting and was filmed in a part of New Zealand that I haven't seen in over 40 years and a part of China I would like to see . It was good to see a brief cameo of my favourite Asian actress, Ming Na Wen."
1822,"The movie is kinda boring, but it is mulan so I give it a 10."
1823,Everybody who loves and knows the mining of cartoon Mulan will love this movie and understand a legend!
1824,I had such high expectations from the movie and without the dragon it was horrible watching the movie. Disney could have done a lot better with the movie
1825,"Overall, Mulan feels like a movie that is torn between being accurate, and bringing some spark of Disney magic to our hearts and it's a shame it didn't bring us both. It's a disappointment despite having bright colors and rich action that Mulan doesn't breathe life into other areas, especially the plot or character development. Hoping a flawless female lead and cultural accuracies are enough to please the audience, 2020's Mulan doesn't get down to business to defeat the soulless, bland tone that embodies the live action remake."
1826,"Well the movie is not like animation there's is a lot of changes such training pillar, the Fénix and the final bottle but great casting and nice movie"
1827,The story was weak. Not only that but so far from the original movie and the true story that it should be called something else. The original story is of a woman who was willing to risk death to save her father. She fought off an army of people who were superior (and in the real story not lead by a woman) she was able to defend her country in this without magic powers of some magic unkillable bicycle kicking woman the real story is extremely impressive this is over done and fake in every way simply to say that there were women in the strongest roles
1828,"It was quite boring with some unexacting stuff but not exactly as the original story. I would not highly recommend it if you are not a Disney fan. I'd rather prefer the cartoons one, I saw it many times during my childhood and it's definitely which I'm going to keep."
1829,Ruined a great movie. The original had great characters wich they removed. And if people can run sideways on walls you could have put mushu in the movie!
1830,Everything that was good about original Mulan was removed from this movie
1831,This movie it's not so bad if you watched it out of thinking about Mulan the original movie. it would have gone a lot better if it was something like Meme or Lolo or any dull other name. but to take the successful name of Mulan and try to let people watch it then you failed the fans and that not so bad movie. not even close to the great original masterpiece.
1832,"This movie has gotten a way worse rap than needed. It is clear that it has been targeted and unfairly reviewed because of political statements and outside involvement. There were some terrible moments in the movie thats for sure, the enemy especially who could run up walls, turn into animals and use magic to attack. These moments literally had me yelling ""WHAT!!! HAHAHA, this is stupid""
The lack of it being a musical and classic characters like Mushu was a missed opportunity. I can see they wanted to do something different and take a risk, but it was one that didn't pay off obviously. What was replaced instead was way worse - a flying phoenix that came and went cannot compare to Mushu in anyway. This movie was a flop for sure and the way it was released was terrible too, so expensive. But it is not worth the harsh scores it has been receiving."
1833,"I was surprised by all the negative reviews so my first time adding to the reviews. Awesome movie, yah, wouldn't want young children to watch but action packed and kept my interest throughout the entire movie. Yes, I have watch the animated Mulan and this is better. Great action, awesome scenes, and watching again."
1834,It wasn't emotional. The plot points made no sense. Takes all the character and story out of Mulan as a character and treats her like she has superpowers and that's it. It doesn't exemplify what and who Mulan is. I enjoyed it every once and a while for 5 minutes or less but that was it. Terrible movie. Not worth 30 dollars.
1835,"If you expect a funny musical this is not the one for you. It is as good movie, of course some parts could be better but the message is very on point. It is more profound than ""I'm going to fight for my father"". I really liked Mulan - humble and strong - and the witch was a good add for sending the message here.
As a fan of the animated one this went beyond my expectations (not like Alladin wich was a huge disappointment).
And no, dont take your 5-yeard old to this"
1836,I can't express enough how much I enjoyed this film. I love the more realistic aspect and more serious tone it sets in comparison to the animation. It was beautiful to watch. I highly recommend that people give it a chance. Go into it with the mindset that it's a different version than the animation.
1837,Well done. Lots of action. Beautiful scenery. A different version of the story that still delivers the message.
1838,"I enjoyed watching this film and the female lead was true to its character. I didn't mind that it didn't have any of the Disney singing, the singing would've changed the dynamic, but the music is true to the animation and I enjoyed that."
1839,"Movie has stunning visual effects like every other Disney movie. Casting is good. Cinematography is excellent. But the screenplay is bit routine and the writers should take look on the script work, which is bad. But it had good action sequences. It is a one time watch. And not every audience can like it."
1840,"For the Disney movie there is massive lack of music. It is nice transformation of classic fairytale to nowdays standards, but in general it didn't catch me much. Additionally spec effects, such as walking on walls, jumping and etc looks quite weak"
1841,"This movie has no great story , not better acting but this movie emotion , woman power rising . Woman's their sloth movement how to become a strongest will that's show here . That's very good thing in this movie ."
1842,Screenplay and dialog between actors was very entertaining. Beautiful cinematography and spacial effects made this movie a pleasure to watch. Director Niki Caro did a wonderful job telling a story of a woman discovering her true uniqueness in the early centuries governed by cultural traditions. Personally I find it refreshing to see actresses expressing what it means to be a woman in a world dominated by men. To see a woman expressing her emotions through a character on screen brings a sense of authenticity to the human experience and what it means to be woman.
1843,"Key words describing this film are weak CGI, bad plot and destroying all good things about original animations. I tried to like this film but I just can't"
1844,"Remove dragon that this movie not funny.
I recommend to watch old version."
1845,Whats stopping it from becoming a great movie well watch Disney animated Mulan and or the Chinese version of Mulan and you will know apart from the wooden acting from the lead the movie misses the omph that makes for an exciting movie
1846,"I'm not convinced that the rest of the reviewers actually ""care"" about Chinese culture nor our history. Because if you truly cared about Mulan's story, you would know that there have been numerous films and TV shows about Mulan and her actual history. Go watch those and then ask yourself if you actually care. This is Disney, they've changed every folk lore and fairy tale regardless of culture.We have one group of ""reviewers"" who are upset because the story doesn't follow the history, then we have another group of ""reviewers"" upset because it didn't follow the original 1998 cartoon. Pick one... or appreciate the film for what it is. Then we have people giving 1 star reviews because of Liu Yifei's comment about the HK police? What does that have anything to do with Disney and everyone else involved, take it up with Liu Yifei.I thought the movie was funny, charming, told an amazing story and captured my culture as close as it possibly could. You can't jam thousands of years of history in a 2 hour film. The story of Mulan, while not 100% historically accurate, doesn't shy away from what the message of the film actually is; loyal, brave and true, it is literally written on her sword and repeated throughout the film. The cast and crew did their best and it shows that this film was not slept on by Disney.Please stop bashing films based on your political views or because it's not something YOU wanted it to be, there are a lot more people involved in this film and boycotting it hurts more than just the actress in question. Because congratulations, you just bashed a film with an all Asian cast, a very rare opportunity in the American film industry that could've given Asian and Asian-Americans a lot of new opportunities."
1847,"This is a good movie, i love the storyline. mulan played the character very well. and the storyis not complicated.made in a ""cool"" tone"
1848,"Don't waste any of your time on this one, you can use this 2 hours for a lot of things but not on this movie."
1849,"You can find methods cheaper than $30 to get a slap in the face.
This movie was an absolute disgrace.
Want something better to do with your time?
Switch from Disney+ to Prime.From predictable wokeness to underwhelming fight scenes, you're in for a snooze fest. The editing was sub-par. Although made as a realistic version of the animated one, this was still inferior in almost every way."
1850,"This movie is nothing like the animated movie. I'm very disappointed because I thought Disney would make it Similar like the animated movie. Just like how they did with Aladdin beauty and the beast and they still made maleficent very good.
There is no Mushu there is no Shang, There is a stupid Phoenix and it's just overall ridiculous.
I hope Disney learns her lesson to stick with the movie that everybody loves because nobody will like this it is one of their very most disappointed movies that I have ever seen in my life and I am a long life Disney fan.
Hopefully Disney will be able to redeem themselves.
This movie doesn't even have a good launch farm she lives in this big old house with all these other people and that is disappointing.
Never watch this movie it's just a waste of time I wasted $29 but I'm glad I did so I can tell everybody not to watch this movie even when it goes out on DVD"
1851,"Okay, the film pays homage to Asian cinema (with some shoots), But that is the only strong point of the film, The direction is poor, The performances are melancholic and robotic, Photography, editing and all sound work is not good, In short a film well below all expectations. But being more personal, I grew up seeing mulan (1998) And a man inspired me, because she wanted to make her parents proud, but she wanted to do what she I wanted... Something that happened to me in my life, I always wanted to make my grandparents proud and do what I wanted, just like Mulan... And at the end of the film, mulan did what she wanted and got her parents' pride, In other words, although the story of animation was simple, it spoke to boys and girls. And we have to talk about the importance of representing Asian Americans in the film... (another great representation of an Asian American and the film The Farell With Awkwafina) So my friend this is a poor film without a soul."
1852,"Story is about a Chinese warrior
it is based in China
so it is only the minimum expectation to want the movie to respect these facts.Jet li's voice as the Emperor is dubbed which is complete disrespect to a well established actor possibly so that the Emperor of China can speak English without an accent!Lets forget there are casts that are from other countries in Asia to portray chinese warriors. I personally find it insulting when movie makers do this.Story's pace is like watching turtles in a marathon run. It starts good and then goes on a never ending tale of building up the story and then the actual interesting parts take maybe less than 20% of the movie. I easily got disconnected multiple times during the movie because of this.Somehow it felt like the movie's attempt to touch on traditions and martial arts aspect of the story was very cliche and from the perspective of someone without any proper knowledge who is only aware of the words not the meaning behind them.The actors were good and it was great to see so many old school actors joining together in a movie but the choices made for the story's pace and direction ruined it all.Next time, dont ever consider dubbing Jet li and bring on a director with cultural and martial art background to at least act as an assistant.It is a shame that a cartoon made 20+ years ago with less budget and technology is still 100x times better than a movie with far bigger budgets and more well known actors."
1853,"There are a lot of comparisons to the animated Disney classic. Ignore those. This is not Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King. This movie is its own retelling of the same source material. It has more in common with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon than it does with the 1998 Disney Mulan. If you are a fan of kung fu movies AND Disney movies, then there is a lot to like here. Don't get hung up on how it is different.The $30 price tag is a little high. However, if you watch it with friends and family it is still cheaper than 4 or 5 movie tickets."
1854,"The content is quite good. But where is Mushu and the cricket? Besides, why isn't there any song like the original movie?"
1855,The animated version was silly and for little kids. This movie was very well written and I was along with Mulan's journey. Very well cast and the romantic elements were pleasing. The battles were great and the ending anticipates a sequel. Happy to see there was no singing because it would have ruined the film.
1856,"This movie could be better with mushu,the movie lacks good characters,no songs and barely anything from the original if they wanted to make a whole new movie they could and just change a few things."
1857,"Not a great movie but much better than the score would indicate. It seems the actress a Chinese American who plays Mulan made one simple statement.in support of the police in Hong Kong. I imagine the score will continue to fall as the idiots on the internet realize they are one click away from changing the world. Incidentally, I think what the youth of Hong Kong are doing and have been so for so long is pretty amazing."
1858,"I love Mulan, and still I prefer the cartoon. I had such hopes for this and on paper it had everything going for it but it just fell flat. I never felt that Mulan had to earn anything in the movie, she was a ninja turtle from the first scene when she was a kid.
The training montage were rubbish and movie seemed to jump from beautiful set to beautiful set with out anything tying them together. The action scenes were all people running up walls, defying the rules of gravity, which meant there was no sense of danger really. And every archer shoots a bow like a laser blaster... I just wish they'd gone for an actual live action movie, like something that could be with in the realms of possibility.
Also what's the message to us girls here, to make it you need to be a chi witch or something, you can't do it by yourself? Doesn't seem very empowering thank you very much."
1859,I very much enjoyed the action the movie had to offer. My only problem was the story felt rushed and just left me with more questions about the rest of the characters and some kind of intro of their background story instead of just their names.
1860,"Kids will like it. Maybe.Fighting was ok. Pace was horrible. No real depth of characters. Movie was really cheesy. I wasn't expecting it to be like the animated classic. I actually really liked the live action Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast as well and appreciate their differences from their animated counterparts.-Storyline wasn't well thought out. Started well. But their desire to have over powered women characters really dampened the story in my opinion. To me it would have been a more powerful message if Mulan overcame her obstacles because of hard work, intelligence and grit, not because she was born with chi powers. The witch just was out of place for me. She was pointless.
-But if you're going to have powers, fight scene could have been MUCH BETTER. Battle sequences were ok at best. With some having no wow factor or we're just dumb. At one point I said, ""Ok Mulan has Ultra Instinct...smh""
-Ending was just dumb. Character decisions were questionable. Very questionable. The witch lol"
1861,"The live actions before this have been nothing than regurgitated less good versions of the animated.Disney learned and finally got Live Action right. This isn't the animated and that's good, it's a different story, it's a different Mulan that stands apart and has its own messages and it's own identity.This isn't a remake, it's a different universe of Mulan and should be viewed that way and not compared to the animated both are great in their own way. We don't compare the Marvel animated universe to the live action and the same goes here. Watch them both and enjoy them both."
1862,Oh no! Look at all the ancient Chinese patriarchy oppressing the poor women.
1863,"I'm so sad. They actually managed to mess up my favourite Disney movie, with the worst story and the crappiest character development I've possibly ever seen. This movie was so boring and lifeless, it just makes me want to rewatch the original to cleanse my eyes.The cinematics look beautiful, but it looks like that's where they put all their money into. Even the acting was alright. It's just the story...I'm all for feminism, but this was just TOO much. Where was the romance? Where was the comedy? Where were the songs? Why didn't they make it as a musical, like the remake of Beauty and the Beast? I just don't understand the choices in this. This could've been great, but they wasted it all just to give us ANOTHER feminist message, with a second random female ""enemy"" warrior, that didn't make any sense. Why not just let Mulan be the only female warrior, it was way more powerful that way. And where was Mushu, and the other characters that gave the original so much humor and life?I never write reviews, but I just had to for this one because I appreciate the original so much and I'm SO disappointed. This could've been so great, sadly it's not."
1864,"So many plot holes. So much makes so little sense. They can catch arrows until it's time to die? Mulan is a Dragonball character for some reason? The villain is a cartoonish, moustache twirling meanie whose motivation is something vague about his father. He plans to take over the kingdom by raiding the imperial city with 10 guys?It starts out okay then gets more and more ridiculous as it goes on. Some of the actors are clearly great but they are absolutely wasted on this.Just...ugh. Why was this film necessary? It's not entertaining, it doesn't appeal to our nostalgia for the original, the supposedly epic tale of courage or whatever just feels hollow. Just... skip it if you're unsure about whether or not you want to see it. It's not worth the time or money."
1865,"I am a massive Mulan fan, the original animated film has always been my favourite Disney movie. However, the animated version was different to the original legend, and that is what the new live action movie stays true to (or more so than the animated movie). It isn't so much a live action remake as a live action retelling, and I did enjoy it, but just not as much as the animation. I missed Mushu, the music and villains, who were very creepy and threatening in the original. This movie felt very much like a Disney+ production, not something I could imagine in the cinema and I found it hard to connect with the characters and the story, sometimes finding myself bored. Without the iconic music, both the instrumental score and the Disney songs, the emotional moments failed to pack as much of a punch. I would recommend the movie for a watch nonetheless (maybe when it's free) and there's no doubt you will enjoy it if you enjoy the original legend, but if you are expecting a 'true-to-the-previous-film' remake, you'll be disappointed."
1866,Just wasn't the Mulan we all remember. Too serious for a Disney film. Where's the comedy? The music? and to top it they took the best characters out.
1867,"But if you're just like me who since as a young girl has seen the original countless of times, you might end up disappointed. For a budget bigger than anything Disney it sure was a letdown and what frustrated me the most was the lack of ""Disney"" in this (the butterflies in my stomach left and never came back after just a few minutes in). I still recommend for people to see this because after all, it's Mulan, who wouldn't want to see it."
1868,"It's different from the original, and it's good! : ) :) : ) :) : )"
1869,"I'm all for the re-releasing and re-imagining of the Disney movies from their renaissance era. There doesn't have to be a Mushu or the catchy songs for the tale of Mulan to be good. When I heard it was going to be more of a martial arts movie I was pumped but the movie is cringey at best. The overall story is good and some of the special effects are good too. I didn't mind the introduction of new characters, concepts, or the removal of the romantic side story. The editing in general is terrible though. It's choppy and lacks cohesion. My guess is a poor production team glued this could-have-been-excellent reimagining into a sloppy unpolished mess. Super disappointing. Don't waste your money."
1870,"It's ironic that the cartoon version is much better and touching than the live version !! The 'Chi' and the witch (GongLi) are unnecessary at all !! The only good point about this movie is the lead Mulan actress, she is doing a good job as Mulan, but directing and script sucks."
1871,"American should get one thing, Mulan is 1500 years old legend, not disney creation, therefore it was done in chinese spirit. Movie is well made in spirit of crouching tiger.
What it lacked was the tiger's atmosphere, I lacked any tension in the movie"
1872,"Maybe if the lead actress had kept her mouth shut about Hong Kong, then we may have enjoyed this film. As it was, she decided to defend the Chinese government even though they are torturing Hong Kong citizens!The Chinese government is responsible for disgusting human rights atrocities and she defends it?!Shame on her and shame on Disney for hiring her!"
1873,"As long as you go into this movie seeing it as a new tale on the legend of Mulan, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie. If you expect it to be a remake of the cartoon, you will be disappointed. I thought this was the best live-action remake of the Disney movies so far. I was not a fan of the others because they so closely followed the exact cartoon plot but lost their charm in the cute side characters and music. Because this one does not do that- if you see it as a stand-alone movie, it is great."
1874,I do not understand the haters and bad ratings. A perfectly entertaining film. Loved it. Must see
1875,"I expected more from this film, but I think that Disney has scored the point: Women should take an equal position in our society, even as warriors. Loyalty, devotion, truth!"
1876,"I very rarely watch a movie that draws my complete attention, and this movie certainly did that. I would even go as to say that it's perfect! It has every element a film should contain, and more! All I can say is that if you haven't seen this yet - it's a must watch and not to be missed."
1877,"Disney must have known how this was going to play out, at least since the very much deserved backlash against the lead actress. The core acting itself is actually good for the most part, however, calling this film Mulan while neither staying true to the animated classic (which I haven't seen nor feel the need to) nor to any pre-Nationalist versions shows a blatant disregard for historical accuracy and signals a total submission to CCP censorship. All the more enjoyable it was to see that their pandering to China and the Wu Mao in particular didn't work out, hence the steep price you have to pay to see this film."
1878,"22 years ago, while random, meaningless symbols showed on film as Chinese words, I tolerated. At least, they got a good story and very excellent dubbing men.Today, while I watched this film, I couldn't help but wonder, how lazy editors are. Don't you study any before shooting?Most background of ancient China is completely wrong. And the worst of all, you don't have any attractive characters in this movie. All their motivation, activity shows pointless, illogical and brainless.Editors are even so lazy that copy idea directly from Star War so called ""Chi"".What the f-word?I sincerely beg all film related people in Hollywood. No matter what kind topic you want to shoot. Do some study! Please! In addition, write a good story.What a waste for this IP! What a waste for these actors and actresses!"
1879,"Apart from all the boycotting the story is just wrong, they took the entire story of a woman who fought against adversity and turned it to a superhero that at the age of 5 runs across rooftops and lands on its feet falling from 20 meters high"
1880,I'm just gonna say DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT A PART 2!
1881,"This is an adequate remake of a film. It is Disney-fied & not a drop of blood was spilt. It doesn't tell the sad story of Mulan but that wouldn't work for the Disney Demographic. It is like a magic trick that creates the illusion that every thing works out for the best for the protagonist. Whereas the true tale was much grimmer and a Brother's Grimm version would have been more realistic & less offensive to the Chinese culture.It is very westernised in that they tell a traditional Chinese story in English... The acting is ok but it won't win any awards as there is not much to it. The wire work for the stunts are fine but it pales in comparison to the Chinese to Western cross-over films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden dragon, House of flying Daggers that remain classics. This film will be ill remembered. They could have tried to appeal to both Western and Chinese Audiences if they utilized some Chinese with subtitles and mostly English in the film but that would not suit a Disney film.It has a forced ""happy"" ending which I don't buy at all. It will not do well due to the political views of the main lead or due to the area in which some scenes were filmed."
1882,"Chinese people faking a Chinese accent is hilarious! On top, this is the first Hollywood film ever to have macho Asians with bass in their voice. These guys are manlier than all the non-Asian men in Hollywood film. As usual with Hollywood, leading roles are miscast. Mulan doesn't look boyish. Honghui looks like Korea's 'Rain' before a Captain America mutation. If you are a martial arts lover, the goofy digi-fight scenes are fun. This 2020 Mulan is good a good comedy. I recommend if you like Rifftrax and MST3K."
1883,Whats up with these Disney remakes at best they should stick to the original animated scripts or at worst they keep doing this and ruining what makes Disney Great story tellers- saying this the movie was good in its own ground sure acting was somewhat wooden but the overall script and message kinda made up for it
1884,"It's a well made movie. It certainly does not include all the storylines like the anime but the message is clearer. It depicts very well the character of Mulan. I really did enjoy the movie and now fully understand the moral of story and what it is about.
Thank you for your work. Very good job.
P.S: Please stop boycotting the movie just because it was filmed in China."
1885,"I don't know what's up with the bad ratings, this is one of the finest disney's live action movies after Maleficient (2014), story 8 + 1 overload Mulan's cuteness + 1 this deserves better rating (shut up all the haters) = 10"
1886,I don't understand bad reviewes. The film is very good and enjoyable to watch. In bad comment just frustrated people... Trust me worth to watch :)
1887,Forget what you know about Mulan before. This would introduce another version of Mulan that you never seen before
1888,I enjoyed this Mulan movie. If you think it was stupid then you don't know your movies. It was fantastic. I cried in the movie. This was better than The Great Wall
1889,"Overall I do like this film. I didn't expect it to be anything like the original Disney film as the live-action approach necessitates a different style. The strengths are in its colourful design and cinematography that make the landscapes and cities of China look absolutely amazing (it was actually shot near my neighbourhood in New Zealand, but you get the idea). However, there are definitely some issues: 1) Mulan has intrinsic superpowers and is overpowered; 2) Mulan never looks or sounds like a man at all; 3) the action is too smooth and appears (ironically) cartoonish; 4) the dialogue is too cheesy even for a Disney film; 5) some scene transitions are too sudden; 6) the character motivations are not always clear."
1890,It was good but I prefer the cartoon. Not the same as cartoon but a good watch with a little difference
1891,"Not sure why anyone would give it anything but a 10. It was just like the Disney movie. We, as a family of 3, loved it!"
1892,For me this is by far one of the best live action Disney films. I appreciated it did not mirror the animation as I'm not sure that would have worked but there were many 'tip of the hat' moments to the original. Disney did however incorporate more of the true Chinese folk lore of Mulan. Well done Disney.
1893,I don't understand why everyone finds this bad... It's a great feel good film.
1894,Must watch this movie. Good balance of action and family drama.
1895,"Disney's production level and quality never let me down. The film perfectly balances mulan's pursuit of personality independence and self liberation, as well as the fearless spirit of willing to sacrifice themselves for their family country . It is absolutely a successful adaptation under the modern values."
1896,"The backlash and controversy behind the actress but it's has nothing to do with Disney and the character Mulan. As far as the movie goes, it was entertaining and lots of fun. Hopefully it will inspire a lot of young teens to be brave, strong and truthful"
1897,"Seriously? People whine and cry for years that there aren't enough strong female characters. You then get on here and bash this movie?The story of Mulan is not YOUR story. It is hers. One that can inspire young girls to rise. Become who they are inside. Yeah, I quoted the song. The one you're so upset isn't really in the movie.Boo-hoo. They didn't include Mushu. GOOD! The character in the original was a mockery of tradition and belief. The update holds closer to Chinese tradition and custom.This is a clean, empowering, family friendly movie. It seeks to instill a strong sense of moral character. To be loyal, brave and true. And it DID IT!The same of you that post that little girls shouldn't be called ""bossy"" probably reviewed this movie poorly. It's not the Mulan you were spoon-fed in 1998. It isn't, by a longshot, the same world.Kudos to the cast and crew. This Mulan kicks....Oh, my bad. Disney movie.Mulan rocks."
1898,"The original Mulan movie has always been one of my favorite movies!
While other live action versions always put themselves in danger of being too similar, there's always a great risk when adding change. Messing with a Disney original is a no go. Surprisingly, this live-action performance did not only keep the greatest charms of the original, it also added new magic and greater meaning. Never would I imagine so much strength and purpose added to the already beautiful story of Mulan, but I was touched to the bone.Dear Disney.
Mulan gave me a lot as a child. The message, the magic, the journey. As a grown up, I didn't expect a re-make to make any difference, but this movie had me dreaming and fighting again, just like when I watched your movies as a child.Tanks!"
1899,"A great movie to watch, the story line and picture animations are wonderful to watch. The main characters are wonderful. Sadly reading reviews that are based on political views rather then focusing cinematography and story line."
1900,This is a great movie. Yes it's not an exact replica of the cartoon version but that's what made it great. It's closer to the folk tale and it was really well done. I was shocked to see the low score but I guess that's the world we live in now. Haters gonna hate. It actually deserves an 8 but I have to counter all the idiot dude bro's.
1901,First When I watched the movie i thought that it will be bad like the lion king live action . But i was surprised that It was really entertaining .I never felt that i am bored . I didn't feel with the time. The writers of mulan are the same writers who wrote Jurassic World and The rise of the planet of the apes. The main character mulan who was played by Yifei lu was acceptable . But the movie didn't have songs of the original animation. The fight battles were good in some places and bad in other . Finally it was an incredible experience during the corona virus Thanks.
1902,"Initially, I was thinking about giving 5 stars when I finished this film since this live action wasn't that good compared to the animation. But now, I gave it 10 stars because of #BoycottMulan thing on Twitter."
1903,"This movie is awesome. The music is great, the visuals are absolutely stunning and there are messages of empowerment and embracing your identity. I never watched the animated one before this I only watched it yesterday and I felt that this 2020 one is actually much better than the 1998 one. People are saying that the animated one is better just because it was their childhood favourite etc... Ignore the haters and don't believe the bad reviews. This doesn't deserve the 5.4 rating on imdb. It's almost a masterpiece except for a few problems. Great job by director Niki Caro and Liu Yifei was great as Mulan. Overall wonderful movie for the family to watch and it is definitely worth spending $30. Second best remake after Aladdin 2019. I loved it so much that I aldready watched it 10 times. A tip to liking this movie- Just don't compare it with the original and watch it with an open mind and don't politicize it. Though it's not perfect, it is actually a good movie. According to me, it's a must-watch. I recommend going with the Certified Fresh 74% rating on Rotten Tomatoes rather than this 5.4 rating on IMDB"
1904,"Ok, I admit I never saw the animated version but did after I saw this brilliant live-action adaptation that is clearly a different version. I found the animated version very sophomoric, like you would expect in a film for kids. Eddie Murphy as a Dragon genie, funny, but nothing Chinese about it and rather insulting to the ancient Chinese culture. I think Disney made the smart, respectful choice by making the live-action version truer to the sense of ancient Chinese mythology while still preserving all the Disney family values. Most importantly, value for women. We rarely get to see women playing heroic roles, so as a father of a 16 month old girl, I can't wait to show her this incredible film when she's older and can understand it. What I can't understand right now is how anyone could hate this movie at all, perhaps they just don't get good cinema or culture in general?"
1905,"The action or fighting in the film feels bland.
Even warfare doesn't look grand.
And an ending that doesn't give a hand."
1906,It was something to watch it wasn't something that kept me in my seat and I'm really annoyed she didn't cut her hair like in the original and the Phoenix didn't make much sense it just flew around at random times and the stories line was to long it could of been shortened or added to
1907,"Original was great but this movie is a garbage waste of time. This has no real character development, no humour. Looks ok, the costumes and cinematography are adequate."
1908,"All Disney movies have some ""moral"" behind every script. This one was ""loyal to family, brave and true"". It was on the point. Believe it or not it was like this back then in imperial China times. So much bad reviews from those viewers who cannot span their horizon and grasp the concept.
If you expected singing and dancing like Alladin then don't watch this movie. If you want to see a pretty good story line - and kickass Asian actors then go see this."
1909,"Given the past history of bringing animation classics to live-action has been a series of gits and misses. Mainly misses. Beauty and the Beast to me was better than expected and other attempts no so.However, Mulan is an exception to this trend. I do not see this new Mulan as a live-action version of the animated version, but a fresh new approach to this intriguing legend of woman warrior in a male-dominated society like China.My expectations for this movie was pretty low from what has been coming out of studios these days, but we were pleasantly surprised. It's central theme of devotion to family was very welcome in these times where families are being torn apart. This film has a very spiritual feeling to it.Film was well directed by Niki Caro and the acting was well done. Most of the top Asian actors were present including a cameo by original Mulan voice actor Ming-Na Wen. Yifei Liu did an admirable job playing Mulan. Her acting was subtle and yet she did very well in portraying a strong spirited woman.We were thoroughly engaged with this movie for its visual storytelling. It far exceeded our expectations and we look forward to more like these."
1910,"What people need to take into account is that just because a new version of a Disney classic is different does not mean that there is excellent potential in a story. Plus, one thing this movie managed to get right was the pronunciation of Mulan's family name.The only part I found weird was the movement of the emperor's mouth when he was speaking. Besides that, the message of the importance of family and not giving up really hit home for me, and I believe that most people should be looking at these points of inspiration, especially during these troubling times."
1911,"Something classic because of its history. Mulan is an old Chinese story. It has thousands years of history. Unlike other princess movies, ""Mulan"" itself is history.
If you spend money to see the 1998 Mulan again, maybe this is not a very good choice. The best choice is to watch the 1998 movie again.
If you want to watch a movie that tells you a Chinese story, a story that has encouraged many young women and girls, you can safely choose this one. It won't let you down."
1912,"I think the film is good and excellent .If you give a true heart to see the movie, you can find what the director trying to tell the audience, what is traditional Chinese culture and what is real ""mulan"". Something good about the movie is they aren't trying to make the movie like or pretend to be animation. If the movie make like that way, I'll say you just go to watch the animation version, but If you want to know what is real "" mulan"" and what's mulan film recreated for, then you definitely need to watch it."
1913,"I honestly don't know why this movie got this really bad rating and why some people hate it. It's one of the greatest live action adaptation of a disney film. People don't like the actress, Liu Yifei because some politicals controversities but chill up she is just playing a characters in here. Some people don't like it because of Mushu who is missing or the songs from the original. But this is not only a live action adaptation, it is also bassed on the ""Ballad of Hua Mulan"".
I loved everything about this film. It is very colorful and so beautiful to see , nice characters from the originals are in here and new ones added. It's visually stunning!I liked the new version of Mulan - she wants to take her father's place in the war that threatens the kingdom and she does so. She was trained to fight, and she wants to bring honor to the family.
She is a bold character, optimistic and confidant.
She takes great advices from the witch.The witch is a powerful character added to the new story of mulan. She isn't really bad, she just want to integrate and was exilated her whole life. She gives me ""Snow White and the Huntsman "" vibes.Bori Khan - he is the villain to the new movie and a new version of Shan Yu. He wants to take down the emperor and rule China and he wants revenge of his father death.Honghui - it's Mulan's love interest of this film. They have a huge connection but they don't kiss or stay together in this film. He is replacement to Li Shang and it's a cool character. He helps both Mulan and Hua Jun. And it's very friendly.I loved the script, it was different from the animation. But it kept some originals scenes like the matchmaker scene or the snow avalanche. I liked that in this version Cricket was mentioned as a human character and in this movie, Mulan's grandpa is replaced by her sister. I didn't quit like the fact that grandpa was missing but i liked it anyway. The songs from the animations are played in the background and there is a lot of actions in the last half of the film. I liked the relation between Mulan and her father. And i liked the misterious Phoenix who is showing around Mulan in time to time.I really hope they make a sequel to this because i want to see more of this beautiful movie, and more of this characters or about the phoenix. This was a masterpiece and i'm glad it was made. Good job director and Disney for making this great film! I recommand it to you all and don't watch it thinking it's a live action adaptation of the classic movie, just think it's a new story that will surprise you!"
1914,"Like the remake of 2019 Aladdin, Lion King, Dumbo, 2017 Beauty and the Beast, 2015 Cinderella. A now Mulan 2020, their complaining because it is not like the original animated version. You got to look at it like it's a different movie like, for example, Sleeping Beauty to Maleficent is a different movie and they should get recognition for all the work to make a live classic also Ming-Na Wen from Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Also, they went with a different variation of the Mulan Legend. So great movie I want to watch it again."
1915,This movie was amazing! The only people who are putting bad reviews are people who like musicals and children's stories. This was pure action movie and had many improvements from the original. Although I did miss mushu at first you pretty much immediately forget he was even there in the first place because of how well done the move is
1916,Do not compare to the children's movie. It's a movie about war and how a woman breaks the law to save her father. It does have fighting and killing with amazing stunt work and fight choreography. The cinematography is so gorgeous!! I think it was a beautiful and powerful film. The actors did an amazing job!! Loved it!!
1917,"This movie was absolutely amazing. If you go into it expecting the original, you'll be disappointed. If you want the original, WATCH the cartoon, otherwise, watch this remake with an open mind and see it for what it is, moving and inspirational. Also, Jet Li was almost unrecognizable but great as the emperor."
1918,"Beautifully shot & great casting of asians fav like donnie yan, jet lee, jason lee, tzi ma, cheng pei pei(wld be nice to have more of her) & gong li, but sadly thats about it. the story is bland & most of time makes no sense. joy u get from the animated film is nowhere to be found here. actress playing mulan openly supports hong kong police brutality & it tainted the movie even before it released. everyone can have their own political views, but supporting violence is a no no & an insult when u are portraying a respectable righteous legend. as for her acting only some emotional parts was good, rest were mostly blank emotionless stares."
1919,"I love Mulan , I love Liu Yifei too, hope to see her in more movies"
1920,"The most correct decision made by the authors of the new reading of the poem about Hua Mulan is an attempt to abstract from the original 1998 cartoon. While the modern version of Mulan still adheres to Walt Disney's framework for how directors and screenwriters need to work with familiar stories of classic animation, the film still has an ambition to be a project in its own right.
In general, if we talk about the cast of the film, it's quite excellent.
But despite such a successful casting decision, Mulan's story cannot be believed. The script of the film is a uniform mess, rushing at full speed into unknown direction. It feels like the authors were in a hurry to show everything to their viewer as soon as possible, fearing to miss his attention even for a second. But if the viewer really had something to miss, there would be no questions. The truth is no need to watch this film in order to know what and how it works.
Yes, the studio didn't need to invent a new Chinese poem. But the film clearly had the ambition to be something epic on a grand scale in the best traditions of Akira Kurosawa, the master of samurai epics.
Let's look at the situation from the point of view of movie makers. We have a certain trend in Hollywood cinema that has been popular in recent years and we want to adjust the good old story familiar to the audience for it. Let's transform a solid, but old-fashioned, musical cartoon into something serious, without songs and culture, straightforward and epic, filled with bright colors and aimed at the modern viewer. Here I immediately have a question: Would you like to take the material seriously then? No, it is better to sit on two chairs: try to buy the viewer with colorful, fabulous shots that look crooked, and at the same time bring to the fore the morality loved by Dominic Toretto - ""Family is the main thing"". And then, having calmed down the absurd battle scenes and letting out an artificial tear over a difficult fate, say: ""Yes, we made a movie with meaning."" It turned out poorly. If you remember the original, which could both make fun and give a simple moral at the end, then there is also a clear construction of scenes and dialogues, which is simply not there in the 2020 remake. Here is a collection of quotes, standard images and abstract beautiful backgrounds. $200 million have gone nowhere. The whole film is saturated with artificiality, and the script only makes it worse in this case.
Very difficult to find something positive about Mulan (2020). Disney doesn't try to put out good and interesting adaptations at all. Nobody says that the film should be exactly the same as it's predecessors. But the viewer should be interested. In fact, the graphics, production of the film and the visual part of it are beautiful, but it's not enough to decorate a fairy tale, you need to be able to present it with a good story and script.
As a result, film production and visual part - 10, story and script - 2."
1921,"This movie was very beautiful, however the story and concepts they had going on here made it a MESS of a film! Skip it!"
1922,Dont waste your time on this its really really boring
1923,"I like seeing Mulan as a true hero. She is much stronger than in the animated versions, more of an inspiration to young girls. This version also doesn't feel mildly racist like the previous versions. Some critics missed the musical aspect, but I can't imagine an action musical. It would have trivialized the strength of this Mulan. Yifei Liu does a great job balancing drama and action."
1924,"I didn't see anything in that movie , the animation movie is more better than that ."
1925,Watch it without any expectations and guaranteed you will love it.
1926,"A remake of a tale about an inspirational hero who exemplifies values and virtues and who overcomes not just evil villains but also both class and stereotypical obstacles should do well.Add to that a cast that reads like a who's who of accomplished Chinese actors, breathtaking scenery and the magic arts of hollywood spread evenly on a screenplay that provides a good balance of drama, humour and action and it starts to shout ""Slam Dunk"".As a movie, Mulan is far from perfect. The acting is middling, the dialog cliched and syrupy and the CG passable, a decade ago. But the themes are strong, the storyline while predictable is coherent and overall it does what cinema and Disney do best, it entertains.Yes, it is based in a country that's currently on the nose, the values contradict reality and some cast members have personal views that grate but as a movie Mulan in no way deserves 1 and 2 stars.The same storyline set in any other culture would easily garner more favour. At a time when a few minutes of detachment and escapism is sorely needed, Mulan delivers, but only to those able to suspend the white noise for the 2 hours.Go see for yourself, if not for you then for the children."
1927,"This movie was a pleasure to watch and I will definitely go see it at the cinema because I would be sorry if I didn't go.
Liu Yifei's performance surprised me. There is a wonderful beauty in her. She is Mulan herself in the movie.
Thank Disney for choosing Liu Yifei as Mulan.There is no doubt that the performances contributed by Liu Yifei laid the foundation for the excellent performance of the whole movie."
1928,Absolutely beautiful. Loved it! Powerful and magical.
1929,"My family says THANK YOU & AMAZING JOB to all involved in this project! My whole family was gluded to the screen the entire movie. This is coming from a family that rated IP Man a 10 as well. Donnie Yen is the man! Jet Li is the man! Liu Yifei/Mulan was the Woman!If you are expecting to watch a cliche magical Disney musical I'd suggest you check out one of the other 90% of Disney's movies. If you are looking to watch pure filtered, magical & action packed entertainment this one's for you. We loved the heart filled message. Loyalty, Bravery, Truth & Family.Thanks again to all involved!"
1930,"Don't listen to the nay sayers. This is definitely more mature, as was expected. The cinematography is gorgeous. Perfection!"
1931,"In the movie, Mulan takes off his male military uniform and spreads her hair on the galloping steed with the background music reflection, which is very exciting. As a woman, she can also lead the army to rescue the monarch. In a patriarchal society, she has won respect and found her own place in the patriarchal society."
1932,"Most of the movies use live shooting, which is very enjoyable to watch on the big screen in the cinema. The effect of pirated film source is completely incomparable. Magnificent snow mountain, gorgeous Danxia landform, vast grassland, the guardian God of the flower family, Phoenix, appear in the camera for many times, which makes people admire its beauty. The Phoenix in the movie is not only the patron saint of the flower family, but also represents Mulan's faith. The Phoenix appears every time Mulan is firm in her heart.Liu Yifei's performance is really wonderful."
1933,"This film is a winner with epic action and tantalizing drama .A young Chinese maiden disguises herself as a male warrior in order to save her father.The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous .Filming taking place in New Zealand and China. With a production budget of $200 million, it is the most expensive film ever made by a female director.Director: Niki Caro
Writers: Rick Jaffa (screenplay by), Amanda Silver
Stars: Yifei Liu, Donnie Yen, Li Gong, Jet LiAmazing set pieces. Every frame is like a work of art , stunning to look at . The film score is top notch . This film is not a musical and that decision to remake Mulan (2020) as a historical action drama really pays off in the end .Bringing the audience a fresh and new cinematic experience differentiating this fresh story from the charming Mulan (1998) American animated musical original.The action and martial arts fight sequences are very well done.
Yifei Liu as the live action Mulan I read did 90% of her own stunt work . She rides horseback , wields a sword (Single-handed jian and scabbard of the 18th-19th century.) very convincingly. These are the type of skills the casting director were looking for specifically when they interviewed over a thousand candidates for the role of Mulan. Yifei Liu is perfection in her role. Her acting is some what ""stoic"" which in my opinion represent the Chinese culture perfectly. Yifei Liu was tremendous bringing the legend of Mulan to life .Disney's live-action adaptation of Mulan has earned a PG-13 rating. This would make Mulan the first of Disney's live-action films - based off of animated classics - to earn above a PG rating. This brings in the needed drama and action ramping up the intensity and grit to really make this film shine. I thoroughly enjoyed this epic-scale story about the power of being yourself in a world not ready to accept that, a tale that will likely always have resonance."" 8/10"
1934,"REVIEW - MULANI simply don't understand, this film has a 5 rating on IMDB and it was only released yesterday as a Disney exclusive!Follow the story of Mulan as she grows up to become a good wife but events elsewhere make her join the army so her father doesn't have to.This is the live action remake of the original animated and as with Lion King and Jungle Book this is simply stunning.Acting draws you in, action and fights not graphic but the sheer size and colour palette just makes this into one definitely to watch.From start to finish your hooked and this is a total masterpiece, so we come back to my initial question at the start of this review, why only a 5 because this film is undoubtedly a...........Rating 10 out of 10"
1935,"It's a good movie, I don't understand the reviews but the story is great, there are some minor flaws but the movie is awesome.
Good Job!"
1936,"Im a big lover of the original disney movies and was sceptic about the Mulan one, because knew it was alot different from the original one, but I still wanted to see it because I thought it would still be good. I was so wrong. It was so bad. I liked the story but it was so badly done. I felt like I was watching a old action movie with better graphic. The fighting scenes and special effects really made it feel so wrong"
1937,I am a huge Disney fan but this is just unbelievable. It is a bad movie in every single aspect regardless of the absence of Mushu and the phenomenal soundtrack from the original.
1938,"Disney has been a universal company that has implanted role models and ideals into the mind of almost every child. The characters, the music, the morals, and the themes of Disney movies have played a crucial role in developing life values for numerous generations. Lately, Disney has been remaking many of their classic movies into live-action films such as Aladdin, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and many others. Mulan was the most recent live-action remake that was released in September of this year. The original 1998 Disney animated version is one of my favorite Disney movies, so this remake was exciting news. As I grew up, I watched this movie countless times; the characters and catchy songs became a cherished part of my childhood memories. Hearing about the new live-action remake, I was beyond excited to see it again in its new form and reward my memory by recalling the events in live-action. My excitement was exchanged with disappointment when I learned that my favorite parts of the movie were to be omitted and that the plot was to be greatly altered. In short, every time the plot diverged from that of the cartoon, it had further deviated from what I hoped it would be. This movie fell short of every expectation I had; it certainly did not bring any honor to us all. I would not recommend the 2020 live-action remake of Mulan because of the exclusion of lovable characters and the elimination of the classic songs of the original.To begin, lovable characters such as the comedic Mushu, Cricket, Shang, and Mulan's three army friends have been removed from the 2020 remake and replaced with dull characters who did not add anything to the movie. The little red dragon was replaced with a CGI phoenix, who unlike Mushu, does not even have a personality, as it just seems to appear and float around during some parts of the film. There was also the addition of a witch character, which to me, just seemed confusing and unnecessary. Understandably, Disney tried to make this movie more realistic and align more closely with the traditional Chinese legend; however, it was quite a disappointing revision. What is so realistic about a person who can turn into a bird and fly away? These modifications were as ""mysterious as the dark side of the moon."" These represent a few examples of grievances about the undesired alteration of characters in the remake and listing them all would offer enough material for writing a book.In addition to the alteration of characters, all songs from the animated version were removed. To me, this was one of the most disappointing changes. Since I first saw the cartoon version of Mulan as a child, it has held a special place in my heart; the catchy and engaging music was a crucial part of the experience. Despite already knowing that Disney had taken out all of the musical numbers that were in the 1998 film, while watching the live-action remake, I found myself anticipating them with a false hope that the nonexistent songs could save the movie from its unflattering plot and bland characters. The absence of the universally admired tunes made the 2020 version devoid of personality. Viewers could not see the fun and memorable side of the characters that were known and loved in the cartoon. Without the musical numbers, this remake was simply not a film worth fighting for.By playing around with the characters and cutting out the classic songs, the overall feeling of the movie was just different, and not in a good way. The characters lost their well-loved personalities with the lack of engaging and heartwarming melodies. For example, the removal of beloved comedic figures, such as Mushu, also took away from the overall charm of the film. After going into this movie with much anticipation and high expectations, these disappointing modifications left me with a cold feeling of emptiness that only the original version of Mulan could fulfill. Although Disney offered this remake as an upgrade from the cartoon to join the list of other live-action remakes, to me, these changes denuded the film of its original appeal and felt like a downgrade. While watching the 2020 version, I asked myself, ""When will the reflection of the original film show in this remake?"" I tried my best to enjoy this movie, I really did, but I just could not. It is difficult to recommend this movie to anyone who has watched the original Disney animated version, as it will fall short of any expectations you may have as it did for me. If you are truly in the mood to watch Mulan and are hoping for a cinematic masterpiece, I would just stick to the original."
1939,Disney exceeded all expectations and made a movie even worse than we could have possibly imagined. Besides an emotionless array of characters Disney has also graced us with some horrible CGI and concepts that make no sense relating to the story. It all comes full circle with the utterly unimpressive fighting scenes and the fact that they removed the grandma from the original.
1940,"The film has a good budget and good actors, however it does not seem so, the costumes, the settings were of very poor quality. The plot and some of the scenes were very boring, they should have put a good soundtrack with good songs. There was too much fantasy, it would have been better to make it similar to the original; a girl who fights and tries hard until she gets what she wants. It would have been a more captivating film if they had added more romance, more emotion and more action to the film and its scenes."
1941,"A relatively different approach than your typical Disney remake. This movie does not just apply VFX over the original Mulan. But changes most of the story. BTW original impression remains untouched.The downside of the movies being the story, action, VFX. ie. for the most part movie is bad. Action scenes feel fake as actors seem to be pulled by a string in most of the scenes.'This movie does however increases the respect for original Mulan."
1942,"This is a decent and nice movie! Great story and a good movie to watch with the whole family.
This movie is one of the best Disney live action movie."
1943,"I've never seen the animation of Mulan or know much about the history of the story of Mulan. I have seen many Chinese battle, war and martial arts epics though. As a stand alone film I thought this was great. By far the best live action film Disney have made to date. I hated what Disney did to Star Wars, especially the explicit undermining of men and purposeful exaggeration of women's dominance, but Mulan got it spot on; it felt authentic and that's all I ever want. An authentic and captivating film is my judgement; possibly because I am naive to the history, but this is an entertainment industry. I was entertained."
1944,I loved this version way more then the cartoons. Really great movie!
1945,I dont understand why everyone's hating on it. Me and my daughter (9) loved it. Yes its not the original but its still good. We loved it anyway. All the bad reviews didnt put us off and im glad. Great film.
1946,"Good once to view movie. Correct story, happy end, no brutality, and moral, content to be told. Not a milestone, but entertaining with moral, with a hero, who can be supported.
It would be a 7, but as I see so many evil reviews, I want to balance a little bit. 8."
1947,"I'm not sure why the reviews are so bad on this I thought it was incredibly beautifully made them with a wonderful message. From the beginning , I was hoping it would be different from the animated version and most of the complaints are that it is so different but it is a live action interpretation and I think everyone should approach it with fresh eyes. It's obvious they put a lot of time and effort into the costumes and the fight scenes and I think they did a beautiful job . My advice to viewers out there, give it a chance! So many people are sitting at home right now or just looking for reasons to complain but I think it's a good thing to try and enjoy something new for once."
1948,"Never seen the cartoon. It's a beautiful, well made film. Perfect for the 21st Century. Ignore the doubters."
1949,I don't know why people is complaining that much... the movie is good and was not suppose to be a copy of the past animation. It is fun to watch and also a nice story
1950,I don't see why people are giving negative reviews on this movie. Maybe it's because they wanted the cliché romantic story like the cartoon.It's sad to see how people can't enjoy a great movie without the usual sexual tension! Mulan 2020 was filmed closer to the real story.I love that this movie focused on Chinese culture. If you don't like the movie I would say that maybe your racist against the Chinese culture. I've watched many ancient Chinese dramas and movies. Mulan was very close to the culture and sceneries.The acting wasn't fake and that's why I have always enjoyed Chinese dramas and movies. THEY DO THEIR OWN STUNTS! You can't say that isn't amazing.There is only a few American actors who do their own stunts who I truly appreciate being apart of the entertainment field. The Chinese culture is something to be enjoyed and appreciate.I may not be Chinese but I have always felt close to the culture. I'm happy Disney didn't make this movie cliché and corny like the cartoon. They made it more realistic.I hope you can enjoy this movie without the thoughts of negative comments. Keep an open mind and explore the rich history shown through this movie.ITS WORTH THE WATCH!!
1951,"In my opinion, yifei liu was acting as mulan very well besides many of my favorite actors and actress were cast in this movie. Overall, it will be my favorite Disney Princess story, I love how this movie is presented, I love the cast, I love the script, I love the VFX/computer graphics, I love their makeup style. So, thank you Disney."
1952,I couldn't wait until December. And I was not disappointed. It was everything I expected it to be with a cast that included the legendary Jet Li and Donnie Yen. Perfect. The beginning is definitely what made it great. I love the back story they added. Heck yeah it was corny. But definitely a good corny.Side note...I came to the conclusion that these live action movies of the Disney Vault greats are meant to cater more to the generation that grew up with them. It only makes sense. We're all grown up now.I also love the fact that they included the Mandarin version of Mulan's theme song in the end credits.I think it honored the roots of Chinese martial art films. One of the reasons I really liked it. Only thing it was missing? The out of sync lip movement to English words.
1953,"It's not that bad actually, the acting and effects are decent. Everything was built up nicely in the first half until the battle with the Rourans; Mulan revealed her identity for almost no reason, she have some kinda superpower, which makes all easy for Mulan's quest and less realistic, and the witch subplot is corny and poorly executed at the end. This movie is obviously missing Mushu's charm and humor, the characters are not developed enough for you to care about them and the movie totally lacked soul, which is definitely not the case in the original animated movie.For some reason I like that there wasn't any music 'cause things would have been two times cringey like in the Aladdin remake."
1954,"This is the day I learn never to judge a movie by it's rating. Better than the animated version and I have to add, this is by far the best movie released in 2020 so far.
Excellent casting, vfx and action scenes. Of course, the story was realistic and truly meaningful."
1955,This film he such a great story ... The fact that she fights against her family it's something that we all can related as the most times to follow our heart and our dreams we have to abandon family and friends and also the all pain that she goes through to protect who she really is ... I love it
1956,"There's really a lot to love here. C'mon folks, it's a fairy tale very well told, beautifully filmed and well acted. I expect the actors had a job to do to train for their action sequences. And the Crouching Tiger-Hidden Dragon style magic gave it an extra touch of mystery (so what if it's not reality?!) Like all fairytales and folktales it was meant to convey ideas - many of which we'd do well to hear more often - even in less beautiful and creative ways."
1957,Absolutely loved it. It's a great movie. Don't let the naysayers convince you it isn't a good movie. Just don't expect traditional Disney.
1958,I have been waiting years for a remake!! I loved it 😃
1959,"Thats probably the nicest thing i can say right now. Does no justice to chinese culture, the animation or the real story at all. They took the animation and took all the good parts out and whats left is this pile of dirt"
1960,This film is terrible. I can't even find the words. Avoid.
1961,"I like the animated mulan though, i am not a big fan of it compared to other disney classics. Trailers of the live action mulan gave us a hope that it may be a well made remake but also raised doubts whether this version would be as superior as the original or not. Disney is often in a tricky zone while making a live action remake of their classic coz they would receive flak either for not trying anything new or trying something different by tampering the feel of the original. Mulan 2020 is in the latter position. While jungle book and aladdin tried something different without tampering the feel of the original, mulan here fails completely for the sake of trying different.
The biggest drawback of live action mulan was turning the character of mulan into the chose one aka a superhero. The animated mulan was an ordinary girl who trained hard to become a warrior and gives motivation to women. But this mulan is invincible right from the beginning and trains in the army like a pro. That steals away the real message of the film. Plot is predictable. There is no fun elements for kids to enjoy. There is no thrill in training, action and war sequences. One doesn't get touched in the emotional scenes. The supporting characters are uninteresting. And, finally the lead actress does well in action scenes but gives a very blank performance throughout.
On the whole mulan 2020 is one of the worst live action remakes from disney which made me a fan of the original more. Even if its seen as an independent film too its bad."
1962,"Feminist movie, written by women, directed by a woman - so on top of trends. The same mistakes again and again so feeble. I can't even say that there's no soul in it, because there's nothing alive at all. Firstly - a bad writing: there's no character development, the main heroine is just happened to be a superhero from the very beginning, I mean literally. The main antagonist is a laughing stock of a character, his final fight and death is just no comments. Ridiculous death of a secondary character without a reason or a storyline whatsoever. And a lot of other couldn't-care-less type of mistakes and decisions. Secondly - bad acting: like for real where, just tell me where they find such ""actresses"" as the main one in this film, was she even educated as such? Is it a joke or something, literally one straight face during all film, I am not pulling your leg here, maybe she has this super power that she is made of stone and can't show any emotions as in line with X men, then I admit her perfomance was smashing, she has surpassed Kristen Stewart in acting by far. There's no point in writing more , I feel like i am digging a pile of something unpleasant with a stick."
1963,"Well,they really changed it a lot
and i thinks Disney needs to stop sucking out of these great classic Cartoons5 stars for hardworking on this movie"
1964,"Woman power... I love this movie so much, teaches how the very basic principles can take u such a far way.
This one movie that I can remember something meaningful from going forward
Loyal, Brave and Tru 🖖But ofcourse not many will agree with me because they rather movies with high content of negativity, sad to say but this one ain't like those hence why y'all give the 1 star but I'll put the 0 behind it 👌"
1965,"Woman power... I love this movie so much, teaches how the very basic principles can take u such a far way.
This one movie that I can remember something meaningful from going forward
Loyal, Brave and Tru 🖖"
1966,"Love love loved it!!!!! It's so good. You have to go into this film knowing it's not like the Disney animated cartoon, but it's own movie."
1967,Don't watch it. one is the very good rate. this movie is not fun at all
1968,"Since the WENDY movie I don't expect something great from Disney and I was right, this Mulan movie was just boring .The original Mulan didn't know how to fight , she didn't have a sister and where is Mushu and the cricket? Also who is that witch and witches was not something bad in China and they weren't called witches , that is an American thing . And most annoying of all is that POWER everyone called Ki , Ki is just the inner energy of humans and it needs a lot of practice. And last but not least were are the songs??? And if the movie was more realistic as a fantasy movie can be it would be only 10 sec for the witch to kill the emperor or king whatever"
1969,Second half become boring.. the story is not as excited as the original movie
1970,The story does not match the real environment of China
1971,"Disgrace to the original, just a boring movie. The best characters and parts are left out."
1972,The plot was strange and illogical especially the ending part. The fighting scenes are too boring.
1973,"This movie officially destroyed the goodwill of Disney Movie. Nothing could be compared to this, its horrible. From the plot to the cast, everything does not worth a penny to watch.
Waste of time and money! Disappointed completely!"
1974,"Totally wasted my money & time to watch it
The worst movie from Disney ever!"
1975,"At first, i though it was a good film but after watched it, i have to think again. To be honest if i were you, i wouldn't watch this terrible film."
1976,It's a bit slow but interesting anyways. Only issue is really switching to it's her chi that makes her great rather then being a woman doesn't matter working hard is what paysoff.
1977,"As a Chinese audience, these three points are for photographers and editors. I like the color editing and movement of this film very much. This is the level that 2020 should be. But I am really disappointed with this movie. The reason why Mulan is liked by the whole world is because she is an ordinary person and was born in an ordinary family. She bravely broke the rules of the world and went to the army for the family. Rather than a magician using the so-called CHI to fly . And the witch is completely unnecessary in my opinion. If this role is deleted, it will not have any impact on the plot."
1978,"No Mulan Music, No Mushu,... instead a silent bird that looks like a kite.I LOVE the original Movie, the Soundtrack, the people in it. I Laugh, I Cry, I get excited, a lot of emotions during the Movie. I even feel the romantic story of Mulan.In this Movie I feel nothing, No conection with the characters because they barely talk, no singing, no laughing...."
1979,"Well... I think the movie was really bad. The color palette was nice, but the special effect were nasty. The dialogues omg, I didnt like a single one!! all of them were forced to say something metaphorical, it was like they ate a Neruda's book.
Also I didnt like this new witch and the fact that Mulan has ""powers"", I like the original version of Mulan animation bc they showed that a woman can do things like a man with effort and even overcome them, and in this they show that Mulan could do it bc of this birth power she has. Im not a film critic just my personal opinion."
1980,"The animated film taught me the values of hard-work, determination and wit as well as the importance of teamwork. We shine by being ourselves and placing family and country first. But in this movie, young females are being taught differently. Mulan stood out because she is ""special"". She can jump and run on roofs. And kicks an arrow into the villain's chest which kills him. So, we need to be born with talent to shine? How is that something to teach young females? Hollywood can't tell the difference between a Mary Sue and an empowered female. Also, we can't have Mushu. But we have a phoenix and a shapeshifting witch.I gave the movie, 1/10 because there are no positives. Besides the bad narrative and message of the movie, Liu Yi Fei and the other actors wooden facial expressions in this movie somehow. It is weird watching a live-action movie with Chinese actors speaking English.And Liu Yi Fei's support for police brutality, Donnie Yen wanting Hong Kong to return to China, and the movie relation to the concentration camps...not helping the movie's ratings."
1981,The addition of the witch makes zero sense! And the movie looked superficial. Should follow more the original storyline. Very very bad effects at the beginning.
1982,Not like the original. But why it needs to be? Great Disney Movie! Liked it alot and my hardcore Disney wife loved it.
1983,"For me, it was a good movie. Maybe others are expecting that the story is the same as the old one. I'm good with it."
1984,"Remove the concept of the cartoon from your mind and go in with expectations of something new. This movie was designs to appease Chinese audiences as well as American. It's essentially a foreign film. Despite the negative reviews, Mulan is filled with magic, martial arts, beautiful scenery, great casting, and a good story. Much of what was cut out from the cartoon was never in the original story. So do not have expectations from the cartoon, but expectations of a different version of the story based off the actual Chinese legend.I enjoyed the movie, I'm sure you and your family will as well."
1985,"Niki Caro's 'Mulan' is a film that strives to please as large an audience as possible. The investment of over 200 million dollars makes this production fall into the category of the most expensive films in Hollywood and because it is also a film with a strong feminist message it is worth mentioning that it is currently the most expensive production in the history of cinema directed by a woman. The producers, of course, dream to recoup their investment, which is not an easy task given that the premiere takes place in the year of the COVID-19 pandemic when most cinemas in North America are closed. The challenge of looking for success on alternative streaming channels and in international markets, but especially in China, in parallel with trying to make the film attractive to the traditional audiences of the Disney Studios (children plus one or two generations of company) but also to art martial arts lovers or historical dramas fans have led to the creation of a mixture in which quite a few compromises have inherently been made. The result is a carefully choreographed film, and I'm not just talking about action scenes, and a visually appealing one, but lacking depth and avoiding controversy.The script takes on the legend of Mulan already addressed in a cartoon version made in 1998 and emphasizes both the feminist and patriotic messages. The daughter of the warrior who takes the place of her sick father in the army recruited by the emperor to fight against foreign invasions is endowed with vital forces (the legendary Chinese 'qi') specific to the great fighters. The problem in a male-dominated society was at that time that women with such qualities could be nothing but witches. These prejudices, of course, existed not only in the Far East but also in Catholic Europe or in the colonies of Puritan and Protestant North America. Vital forces are strengthened by moral qualities - courage, loyalty to friends, and faith in the truth, and Mulan will only be able to achieve her destiny by revealing her true identity. The screenwriters managed to navigate skillfully in the politically correct and ideological labyrinths, and to add to the basic moral qualities the family values that work well on any meridian. The result is a little too rose-watered, but not more so than in other Disney movies, and I think it will be quite appealing to the children generations of today and in the future.
From a cinematographic point of view, Niki Caro's film is very well done, combining the landscapes filmed on location in China and New Zealand, the stunts and the effects of computer graphics. The lovers of martial arts in movies can also enjoy a copious and well-executed ,even if not very original, feast of acrobatics, flights and running on vertical walls. Yifei Liu plays the lead model role well, but the most interesting character in the film is her enemy, the evil witch Xianniang, played by Li Gong. Xianniang is what Mulan could become if she doesn't pursue the truth and good causes, and the dialogue between the two women with extraordinary 'qi' forces is perhaps the best moment of the film, and the one in which the feminist message seems truer and less didactic. I believe that the commercial success of 'Mulan' is guaranteed, and even if it will not make as much money as the producers had originally planned. The investments will be recovered and the profit will increase over time. But I don't think it will become a reference film, one of those that will enter the ranks of the immortal classics of the Disney Studios."
1986,"The film is kind of okay i can but didnt meet people's expectation. On the down side, everything needs more polish...the acting, the fight scenes,and especially the ending. Its like some scenes are forced. For example, they way Mulan lost her father's sword...the pheonix literally does nothing...the witch sacrificing herself to save Mulan...the avalanche scene...poor character development...its like there is no natural flow .The movie is average nothing more nothing less. On the good side, i liked the soundtracks and music compositions. Its enjoyable in its on way. The fight scenes are excuted pretty well but need more polish. Mulan is Mulan and not a super powered human, its good that she shows some weakness in fights. But generally..in the end...its just an average movie that could have been better."
1987,"The movie on its own felt like a standard action movie of the last 10 years. Little plot or character development with big budget action and visual effects. It was entertaining and the ratings would be higher if it wasn't an attempted re-make.As a live action adaptation of a favorite Disney movie it completely missed the mark. Mushu wasn't realistic enough but a teleporting sorceress that has no ties to anything in the movie was? They are obviously assuming you have seen the original because there are no relationships built among Mulan's family or warrior comrades. Making you feel very little after finishing the film. The script must of only been 50 pages long, which is mind blowing considering how much substance and humor the 98' version had. Passable movie but didn't feel like Disney or Mulan."
1988,I didn't seen this before but I did Saw my other movies is Haunted mansion or Goosebumps 2 for something if is Bad for haveing Goosebumps 2 because the whole world there saying is the worse goosebumps 2 but is a bit confusing there's new movie is Goosebumps 3 like moines know there's Dylan and Oaddy Rush and there's no after won't be there like he's a bit scared for something his name is rylan lee and that's all I need is all about.
1989,"The original story of Mulan historically is a very fascinating tale about a girl that basically takes up arms to protect her father and her family against the evil nature of the empire in an act of filial piety. In this reiteration of Mulan, they completely changed the story. Now Mulan is a guard for the evil and brutal empire. Mulan basically had to take her father's place and ends up protecting nationalism and the party at all costs."
1990,"The actors and cinematography was fantastic for this film, however this story was far from the animated Mulan picture we all grew up to love. There ARE several stories of Mulan and this adaptation proved to be a collaboration of several. Again, my opinion is biased because im shrouded with nostalgia for the older movie."
1991,"To be totally honest from another director and cinematographer, I can see good and bad with this movie. Nobody can say its all bad but how ever, it is far from the best I have seen. I can see this movie had a great budget and the actors weren't great but ok and we must not forget that this is a kids movie. I saw many places that I would do this differently but that's always easier to say second hand. There is many parts of this movie were I find they should have done it differently in both filming and directing but I am not the targeted audience as im over 30, I would not recommend this to people over the age of 7 but other than that I can except this movie. I can type down all the good and the bad but I feel as a casual movie goer that this should suffice."
1992,"What happened to the magic, the enchantment, the songs, the conflict of the original Mulan? Disney basically screwed the story up.I could not even get past the 1/2 of the movie before falling asleep.The worst part of the re-hashed story is that in the original Mulan was human. A smart, brave and courageous woman. In this one, they made her into some super-human heroine with magical powers.The movie has no passion at all. Very, very dull."
1993,"Despite this being the best disney adaptation its not free from easy solutions and lack of character development that could downgrade the development of the movie it self.
The story everyone knows, it's a girl who takes her father place and go to the war risking her life or her family honor.
At the beginning it's kinda confusing who is the main villain but as the story goes it seems more that ""the witch"" takes the primary role and the actually main villain from the animation takes a secondary role until the 30 or 15 last minutes.
Even in the animation the villains weren't that interesting, but at least they work very well when it was necessary to impose fear. But here the lack of personality is quite disturbing and it gets worse when u see the ""the witch"" swapping side just because Mulan like her speech. Dude really how superficial someone can be.
Now, I know we are talking about a disney movie, yet the decision of taking the dragon and the other guy,wich were actually what boost the animation with there sense of comedy, I think it could be compensated if they went through a darker and maybe bloody movie. There's a battle scene between the 2 armies and there's no drop of blood. Even the animation was darker. There's some decision that I didn't agree, like when mulan is in one place and over sunddently is in another. I think the picture would gain more if they show how difficult it actually was to do all of that.
Another thing that I think they could change was the Mulan story arc. Instead of making her badass just because she already was a badass and all it took was to reveal her truly Identity, they could make a longer arc where mulan doesn't have any special hability and she becomes a badass because she was able to go through all the difficulties.
Other things that bother me was the CGI that sometimes made me feel that I was watching a movie from a low cost company; the movie is too long for the story that propose to tell and the actions scenes are competent despite one or two of them being quite bad. Basically if u saw any good action movie you will feel that u already saw better scenes.
Despite all that the movie is quite entertaining since they kept the core of the picture from the animation, so you will have a great time, still the animation is way better."
1994,"This remake was not true to the legend. If they were going to change the legend around with a bunch of nonsense (ex: the Witch and the phoenix), then Disney should've just left it the Disney Mulan we all loved with the songs we loved. The film's lack of emotional depth and Liu Yifei's lack of facial expressions lost my interest. My eyes drifted away from the tv screen not even half way through. Complete waste of time."
1995,"I had never watched the 1998 animation of Milan, so I had nothing to compare to.
I enjoyed the movie, screw the critics that have, and are still panning it.
I watched it for me, and I wasn't disappointed.
All I can say is watch and make your mind up."
1996,"Don't listen to all the haters and bad reviews. The movie was actually surprisingly good so watch it.Most people are trying to make this political or are just hating on it because it's not 1:1 adaptation of the animated version which it was never intended to be. If you just judge it for what it is it's an entertaining, emotional, new and well done adaptation that is much closer to the original source material."
1997,"Honestly a great movie on its own. While there are some things that don't make sense, such as the avalanche scene, it was overall an enjoyable movie. There where many parts that where changed form the original animated adaptation of the story, but a lot more culture as put in. I think it's easy to forget that the story is a Chinese tale first that was adapted by Disney into an animated format, and they harken back to that culture pretty well. Even down to the action scenes, that personally remind me of old Jackie Chan films and the writing which seem to pay homage to many Asian dramas. It is a bit different, and there are some changes that I'd make, but overall the movie was enjoyable and had a great message about honesty and just being confident in yourself without really focusing to much on a specific demographic, making it relate to a wider audience. The way they handled things such as her life in the camp and her desire to do the right thing despite what it could mean for her life was handled quite well in my opinion. Everything from how Mulan would have to wake up earlier and go to bed later to deal with her bindings, to her feelings of guilt for hiding her true identity. I believe that it was well casted as well. Sure we lost some fun side kicks and the main love interest was changed but what they have worked, at least for me. It was believable that these where real people, in a real war. (Cricket being one of the best characters.) However, the movie still has its flaws. Personally Xian Long (The Witch) turned to Mulan's side a little to easily, and I don't understand why she wasn't the main villain. I would have liked the poll scene to have been replaced with something more about wit than strength. I fill that the whole point of the poll challenge was to teach how to turn a disadvantage in to an advantage. Using your head to tern something restrictive into an asset. In this version it was replaced with climbing a mountain with buckets of water. I suppose it could have been a mind over mater thing, however it came off as more of a ""I just got stronger, I guess,"" kind of vibe, rather than being a problem that you had to out think. Overall a good film. I still prefer the animated classic, however, on its own, this film held up. (Also it was nice to see Ming-Na Wen getting a cameo)"
1998,Great acting and amazing martial art scenes. Not a typical Disney film but it is about a warrior.
1999,"It's one thing to screw up parts of something, but it's another thing entirely when every bit of it is bad. This is how Mulan 2020 makes me feel; every frame has something wrong in it. What were the writers thinking when they make this up? This film's setting resembles nothing like China historically. And man they screwed up the dialogue. Half of the top billed cast can't even speak fluent English, the accents they have make no sense, particularly Mulan's little sister Xiu , who has a British accent (though she tried to disguise it with American but it just doesn't work). The setting and acting don't look real in general. And they took out Mushu, a character which I actually liked in the original.The Wuxia reference is weird, why introduce these elements when you have no intention of expanding it, not even a bit? And blending magic into the plot just makes the whole thing more confusing.Why Disney tries a serious tone in the storytelling is beyond me. The scene where Rouran army attacking the garrison is ridiculous, the anti-physics jump (That was cool 30 years ago), no blood shed, not even bruises, and you're telling me this is an army attack. The original did a much better job. The sudden cues of family-friendly really sickens me. Again, why try to be serious when you can't?"
2000,Marvelous and Tantalizing . A great tale told with a new twist. With hints of music and scenes from the animated feature. I enjoyed this version as much as the animated one. Great story telling and emotion. I give a head nod to the creators and artist that created this wonderful movie.
2001,I am a simple girl from a very simple place. I lost my father too young. This movie made me cry six different times. It made me feel like I could conquer the world. It made me feel like I can be respected in the real world. It made me feel like I can be proud to be a girl. and where I'm from that's just not possible for girls. I hate that people keep comparing this film to the brilliant 1998 original film. This film is different. This film feels different. because this film feels real and honest and true to me. I thank every one who brought this film to life. even if it made my life better for just 2 hours I can live off those 2 hours for weeks to come.
2002,What a great movie! Mulan is my favorite Disney princess! The actress crystal Liu is so amazing! She is the best mulan. She did a great job for this movie!
2003,The movie is great Disney use the Mulan storyline brilliantlyMulan without the songs is a bit of downgrade but overall people need to get grip it's a great move all
2004,I have never watched the original mulan or know anything about the story. I watched this movie knowing nothing and I enjoyed it. Why are people so mad because it doesn't match to the original? Why does it have to? I mean someone even complained that there was no music. What? So do we hate movies because there's no music in them now? I don't get the hate. Just watch it as a stand alone movie with out prejudice..
2005,"Watch this movie and enjoy it for its originality. Or be a snobby Disney historian and don't allow creativity in movies or storytelling. Should the trailers have told you Disney snobs that it was a NEW story? Or should you watch a movie with an empty mind. I found the casting of the Mulan character to be spot on. And I was happy to see they showed death, at least in a safe family way so all ages could watch it."
2006,"Its not a cartoon, so why so many people comparing it too mulan the original, is Mabey why they didn't like it. Treat it as a stand alone film, and you will love it, it had a bit of everything for me, funny, action, and a decent story. Give it a go, you won't be disappointed."
2007,"Mulan is a beautifully shot story, where overcoming own weakness and adapting to known order was replaced with inner power. New Mulan is a great warrior from the beginning and thus this move her character (and plot) loses it's power and greatness. You can clearly see this in final battle - where Han doesn't stand a match to Mulan and writers create very stupid solution to force viewers that Mulan MUST uses her Wit to overcome Han and achieve victory.Despite losing plot and origin of story showed in animation years ago, this new creation has its own strength - it is beautiful show, with great fight sequences, superb acting and camera work, along with great music and epic battles. It's darker than animation. And it has Witch - which is at one side great character, and leading all existing events to render them pointless. But, Witch itself is extraordinary character - well played, greatly exposed and way to powerful!It could be piece of art - an extraordinary achievement, but writers overcomplicated it, made one but very important change to the origin and busted it.Compared to original Mulan I would give it 2/10
As a stand alone, new movie, I give it 7/10"
2008,"As one who loved the animated version of Mulan, I can fully say that this is not a remake as many other recent Disney live actions have been... which is a good thing!To those that are unaware, Mulan is an actual Chinese legend. To make this solely a remake of the animated classic, and not its own take would be a dishonour on the legend, a dishonour to the Chinese, and a dishonour to your cow (see what I did there). They are of course similar in many ways, and there are nods to the animated film, such as subtle music queues which are appreciated, but to be clear this is very much its own movie.The scenery and sets are visually captivating. The colours are vibrant with both the costumes and the set pieces. The acting has its flaws, but the passion from the actors is real, and it feels like everyone bought in to their roles. Mulan's father is a strong point as he convincingly displays a wide range of emotions.I enjoyed this film. It has its corny moments, but keep in mind this is a Disney family film, so it's to be expected. Those that criticize for it not being scene for scene like the animated version, or that Disney is pushing a feminism agenda again, are either missing the point or not watching the movie."
2009,I created an account JUST to share this information! Stop comparing to animation!! We don't want a carbon copy of it- this is a great movie and nods to certain characters like the cricket. And the songs they have a little instrumental for it. That's enough! People rating it a 1/10 is ridiculous! It doesn't deserve that. It's a great movie in general. It should bring us surprises and different feel which it did.
2010,The low score reviews seem to come from emasculated boys. Real men see this movie as inspiration for our daughters. Great acting from mostly original non English speaking actors. Subtle but epic story. Be all you can be and true to yourselves.
2011,"Mulan is cool, especially the action part. I can see that the director is feminist. She shows the strength of women."
2012,"I really didn't know what to expect going in and I think I was all the better for it. What I wanted was a re-imagining of my favourite Disney film, something the same but different enough to hold my interest - and this is what I got. I hated the live version of Beauty and the Beast that felt word for word the same. This held all the original concepts for me but it was still an adventure. I felt the acting was great. The reviews talking about the lead actors facial expressions being bland feels unjustified - the whole idea was to try to blend in. I already expected mushu to be too gimicky to include so wasn't surprised he was missing. I think this movie is copping alot of flack but you can still enjoy it for what it is. As a young woman it still invokes all the emotions I feel when watching the cartoon version. Thankyou for bringing Mulan to the screen once more."
2013,I don't understand why people so under rated this movie.its a so nice movie.i loved it.
2014,"I don't usually write reviews, but the avalanche of negative reviews which don't seem to understand nor appreciate the rationale of this remake prompts me to write one to address them.Firstly, this is a REMAKE, and I think those who go in expecting an exact replica of their dream cartoon has already started off on a wrong footing. As one reviewer puts it, the perfect Mushu has already been enshrined in the original cartoon - so why get upset when this reinterpreted the story without him?The purpose of remakes is usually to re-tell the story in a fresh, new way. Some remakes try to stay as faithful to the original plot as possible. Some veer off-course a little. This movie belongs to the latter, and while the necessity of some changes raise eyebrows, I think they have succeeded on certain accounts:1. Portraying the beauty of traditional Chinese values: if you appreciate this as a story set in very traditional and historic Chinese culture, you can see how this remake has made a beautiful attempt to capture the essence of deep values very important to traditional Chinese. Courage, loyalty, and truth - each are retold vividly through Mulan's (and her family's) story and struggle. Her inner struggle to stay True is particularly touching and real.Family ties and filial piety are also very strong values of the Chinese culture. The addition of a sister character is perhaps not as needless as many think, for Mulan's close relations with her sister substantiates the importance of her family to her. The wrapping up of the story with an additional virtue - piety - to Mulan's sword, also speaks volumes of this theme in the movie. 'Chi' is a very core element of Chinese Buddhism, and its addition shows a storyteller very in tune and faithful to highlight traditional Chinese culture. As is the the phoenix, an animal with as much significance as the dragon Chinese (a Mushu equivalent then?).2. Underlying moral themes: I have to admit the addition of the witch is a contentious topic that I have mixed feelings about. But if you see past the cliche magic and pay attention to the moral meaning this character brings out, that sheds light. Circumstances do not give you a right to act badly, and humans have a choice of how they act. The parallel circumstances between Mulan and the witch teaches the lesson of taking responsibility over our own actions - an important lesson especially in an age where so many are prone to react and blame circumstances around them, without considering how they themselves have a part to play and how they should account for their own actions.I have more to add, but I think these suffice to make the point that if one gets past expecting the same movie in form, one will find many treasures within this - not least a chance to appreciate deeply Chinese culture and values, beautiful stunts, and cinematography."
2015,"Not to be compared with the original animated version, it's no where near it but still a better watch. I really loved it the first half was kind of slow but the second was much better. The evil witch loved her character ....."
2016,"Oh my goodness! Wow! That was amazing! Disney outdid themselves with this one. The animation is a fave and hard to top but I held my breath and cried too many times than I could count. The changes were major but necessary and made an old classic even better! This is how the Ballad of Hua Mulan is meant to be told. There is a scene of her on a horse with two rabbits running along her, is a GREAT symbolism taken directly from the poem itself. ""When a pair of rabbits run side by side, who can distinguish male from female?"" Yes Yes Yes! Very very thoughtful inclusion.Out with the haters! Jason Lee, Donnie Yen, Jet Li, the girl from Wuhan, Yifei Liu and the rest of the cast were sooooooo good! Definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen! A film for the ages. I hope they bag some Awards! Crouching Tiger meets Disney! Courage, honor to men and family, and the empowering message young women need to hear is more relevant than ever. Simply breathtaking. Amazing cinematography as China and New Zealand once again deliver. Wow! I wanna give Disney $30 more! Watch it. Pay it. The arts deserve it!"
2017,It's Just One Time Watchable Movie Not Recommending
2018,"I enjoyed it but also I was coming into it knowing that it wasn't going to be like the cartoon. But Overall, still enjoyed the movie."
2019,"So I would label this as 'im glad I saw it, but I probably wouldn't watch it again.'So before I watched this I knew there wasn't gonna be any singing or the light heartedness if the animated film. But for the first 20 I could definitely say that I had some preconceived assumptions about the movie. Once I accepted that this film wasn't going to be the animated film at all, I started to enjoy it. The usual, acting was good, cinematographry, so on and so on.My only two complaints. First, There was some pretty bad editing in the film and some camera 'fancy' camera work that I don't think was necessary.And second, basically giving her super human abilities to explain her fighting ability was pretty trash in my opinion. It just got rid of the concept that she could have achieved the greatness the eventually does through her persistence and hard work, something the animated film did wonderfully.How I would recommend this movie: 'if you go into it with a clear mind, and not judging it based on the animated film, I think you will enjoy it and have a good time. If you are gonna judge it based on the animated film, than its garbage.'"
2020,"The whole movie delivers a strong message, be TRUE to yourself and to others. Therefore when I see all the bad reviews which clearly aren't about the movie, I can't help but feeling sorry for the people who wrote them. They were not being TRUE and it's a shame.I am going to the cinema to watch it again with my parents, my sister and two cousins tonight. It's a great enjoyable and educational movie for children as well as adults. Wish all could be as brave and true as Mulan."
2021,"I liked the new changes, a bit of a ""crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" vibe too which my family liked. A well done adaption (though we missed Mushu)!"
2022,"Watched the movie on Friday night with my sister. We enjoyed every minute of it and we almost cried. Yes we should all be loyal, brave, true and devoted to our family. The beautiful landscape in the movie really made me want to travel again after the pandemic! God bless everyone who stays TRUE in this complex world. Have a nice day."
2023,"I was already disappointed when hearing there was no music and no Mushu, but I actually loved this movie.
So it's not a carbon copy of the original, who cares? It was a great movie, great actors, the story line was pretty much the same and the fight scenes were fantastic. A few minor changes to make it historically accurate but most of the same characters from the original are there. I loved hearing the music in the background from the original movie, and if you know it as well as I do, you can catch some of the lines spoken from the songs in this movie.
Great, fun movie! I will watch it again and again. It was worth the $30 and if theatres were open, I would have been happy to spend 3 times that amount to see it!"
2024,We think this version of Milan is really enjoyable. It definitely not totally the same as the original.
2025,I have now watched this movie 9 times and it's better each time! Its excellent even without the singing!! The characters are well thought out! Its an EXCELLENT movie for young girls and women of all ages!!
2026,I gave it 10/10 because all the 1/10s and 2/10s I find so bizarre. This movie was enjoyed start to finish by my family including myself. Its an inspiring story that is fun with a hero my daughters loved. This is Disney and in Disney fashion provided a heart warming tale. The delivery of the story from the actors in my opinion was a perfect balance of wonder and wisdom. Good Job by all. Ignore all the negative reviews and enjoy this with your families.
2027,Fast paced and entertaining. I never watched the animated movie. I really enjoyed this version.
2028,"I am not going to get into politics about this film coz it seems unfair to hundreds of other artists who worked on this beautiful film, overall, it's an enjoyable film (for kids). My daughter loved it, and she really loves the song by Christina Aguilera.[OK, spoiler alert]: don't read if you haven't seen it yet.

---------------------For me, it was ok, sceneries are lovely, the look is definitely beautiful and I can see they tried to follow the original poem more than the animated version. I don't have a problem that it isn't like the animated version, in fact I welcome the more serious tone, and tried to be a standalone movie. Losing Mushu isn't a problem for me, because historic Mulan has no Mushu anyway and I feel this was an attempt to be an epic. There are good things and bad things about this movie and I will try to be fair.To be honest, the beginning of the movie already felt wrong as you come into the introduction scene of Mulan's village, which is a bunch of round houses. People from outside Chinese culture wouldn't spot the problem, but as someone who knows China, a historic land that has over 200 dialects and over 50 minorities culture, we instantly knew this isn't a typical Han Chinese dwellings, in fact it is a typical Hakka building which isn't started to be built until 12th century, and the original poem about Mulan is based from an era between 4th - 6th century AD. We can safely assume the ""historic"" Mulan come from the Northern part of China definitely not a Hakka who originated in the central part of China.Now some might say it isn't a huge problem as this doesn't affect enjoying a film... yes, to the average white person it doesn't. But it disrespects the varieties of cultures and minorities cultures that makes up China as a whole. Imagine as a Chinese person if I made a film about the English Queen Elizabeth I, and put her palace in the middle of Italy...It's beautiful, right? Surely if it looks good, it should be ok? No of course not. It looks good, but it isn't an authentic representation, so it is going to take people out of it because it doesn't feel ""real"" anymore. I compare to the seriousness of The Last Samurai when they were bothered enough to build a Japanese village from scratch, its attention to details and accuracy was so excellent that the Japanese extra was so shocked with joy and it tears up their eyes! Surely Disney can afford this type of authenticity but chose not to?Before I get into the plots, there's this biggest disappointment I have was that it's such a big waste for Gong Li's and Donnie Yen's character.Donnie Yen's character is supposedly a well respected war time hero/general, who embodies the model hero figure from the Chinese culture as someone who is fair, experienced, wise and firm. But with little proof and work from Mulan after her setting off the avalanche to deplete the enemies, which, he didn't even know it was her handy work, he just went and ask her to lead the army into the Imperial City because a handful of her comrades begged him to listen to her was such a flimsy plot for me.I mean, as the experienced General, surely he knows the way into the Imperial City? What about his honour? They need a better plot than this gleefully general handing the rest of the army to rookie Mulan for no good reason. In truth, the moment of gaining the General's respect is important in the story and it should be crafted better, because it shouldn't feel like so easily to obtain! Honour and trust has to be earned!Also, Donnie Yen hasn't got much action scene in this film either, which totally wasted the talent he has, and failed an opportunity to showcase what a tough war it was. Subsequently, this also rendered the whole Chinese army a bunch of wussy. In that sense, the animated version Mulan did a better job here than the real live action. And for somehow Mulan is the only one who has this special ""chi"" amongst thousands others soldiers is pretty unrealistic, which also brings me to another shock - when is ""chi"" being treated like a special power?""Chi"" can be strong or weak, ""chi"" flows in everyone's body (a literal translate means ""air"", but not literally air that you breathe). You can strengthen your chi by rigorous training. Most importantly, having a strong chi doesn't equate prowess.The mastery of martial art is a skill which requires technique, experience, and chi only plays a part. With only having a strong chi doesn't make you a kung fu master. That's why Chi Kung (the art of chi), is used for strengthening your body and health and is not a typically combat kung fu style. However, many martial artists also practice Chi Kung to strengthen their body, (the flow of chi), to maximise their endurance in combat. (And some say it helps you to heal faster or rejecting toxic out of your body).What this live-action rendition failed to illustrate is the real moral of the story about Mulan, they made everything so easily gained for her to achieve. I wanted to feel like I'm really rooting for her and be at the edge of my seat!The legendary Mulan that we (Chinese) all know so well, to us, it's always been about her determination, endurance, her bravery to be more than what she is being expected, and do the right thing with a courageous attitude without betraying the loyalty is what made her such a respectable figure for young girls to look upon to. The key point is making all those difficult decision and go through with it with bravery. The way they have used ""chi"" in the film as a way to illustrate Mulan is somehow born special, has regrettably chipped away that important backbone moral of this story and taking the attention away the most admirable qualities about Mulan.For Gong Li's character, what an awful shallow character! It has little to no depth to it. You don't feel you care about her, or emotionally invested in her at all. It's pretty obvious her character's existence is simply an excuse to use special effect, since she's a shape-shifter witch (tho I really can't recall Chinese folklores have witches. Traditionally, more like in the form of mystic masters, let alone a shape-shifting witch). And yet, as a powerful shape shifter, she cannot take the form of Khan and lead his army, or has to die so pointlessly when she can just wave her hand to deflect an arrow away from Mulan? Or just impersonated the Emperor and rule the kingdom instead?I mean, honestly, if you have power, why do you need to be cowered down to someone who is ordinary? The film needed to explain why a little bit more. Even if it's because Khan has an army, and she doesn't, the power dynamic should be more of a collaboration, than being ""enslaved"" by Khan. Because obviously, Khan has no power over Gong Li's character at all.And Mulan? Overall her character is ok, but it could have been even better if they investigate more into her feelings. On that point, I can't help but feel the actress has been very wooden-face, almost the same face in every scene, even when she is fighting or sad. It's consistently the same ""looking far away"" look in the eyes, and face is so unmoved that you almost thought she feels nothing at all.Overall, it's a ""certified-whitewashed"" and watered down story about a much loved Chinese legend. Remember the poem we have about Mulan, is about over 1500 years ago. The war she went to lasted for 10 years, and it took her another 2 years to travel back home. The film doesn't even give any hint about the emotional turmoil Mulan must face and the toughness of the war. I understand it is a film for kids, but even with that in mind, there's so much room that they can improve if Disney bothered to hire some Chinese writers who understands the backbone moral of the story and its culture in the writing room. In this case, the animated version did better as they had one Chinese writer on board.And the ""Loyal, Brave and True"" slogan? oh boy, I understand this is effective for children, to represent what Mulan is, or her cultural significance. But the way they play around it is somewhat chessy. It reminds me of all the Chinese words people tattooed on themselves in the 90s, purely because people think they look cool, but made no effort to understand the depth of its culture, which is what I can sum up about the film."
2029,"I loved the movie. Watched it with my 10 year old daughter. It teaches good values, good to see this with kids. I don't know why it is getting mixed ratings but for me it was a really good quality movie."
2030,"The movie is great and I love it, it isnt funny as the original animation, but the legend and the myth is there."
2031,I love the story so much! Wonderful filmmaking and actors actresses!
2032,Great movie .....and good performance by all the actors...
2033,"I won't give away any spoilers but there were quite a few changes from the original. It was certainly missing the comic relief. And it had zero soundtrack - which they saved for the credits! I could understand though that some of the changes were because it was ""real"" life. By why change the family structure?!They managed to accomplish the awkward edge of a female being around men. And it was successful in the sense that multiple generations enjoyed it ( my 9yr old daughter, me, and my mom). I loved that the costumes and casting was done well.Watch it - it is NOT as bad as some of the reviewers are portraying."
2034,"Honestly, I would not have watched this movie had it not been titled ""Mulan"". I was expecting the same feeling of feminism and women's empowerment as I felt when I watched the original animated version. However, I was sorely disappointed. I wanted to get up and leave in the first 10 minutes itself and I would have, had I not come with friends.
It was devoid of a lot of the main characters that stood out for me in the original movie. They left out all the catchy meaningful songs. In addition, some of the scenes were so cliche that they left me feeling very uncomfortable. The whole movie seemed to have a very serious tone, unlike the animated one.
The movie lacks the depth and symbolism that the animated movie had, which made the original Mulan one of my favourite movies of all time. I do not think that the people who made this movie really understood why the original story was so meaningful to a lot of people.
There are a few nice things though about this movie. I did like the presence of the emperor and Böri Khan, the fearsome warrior, and I absolutely adored the scenery.
Since it was called ""Mulan"", I expected it to resemble to original movie in more ways and, because of this, I was disappointed. Had the movie not been named ""Mulan"", I might not have watched it. However, had it been called something other that ""Mulan"", I might have given it a higher rating."
2035,"Absolutely beautiful movie. No, it's not a repeat of the cartoon. It stands out as a story of its own with echos of the cartoon. It was a bonus catching the lines and snippets of music from the first Disney Mulan. But that's not the highlight of this movie. The cinematography, choreography, acting and scenery are stunning and so encapsulating. The only downside is that it was filmed in a region that oppresses the native Xinjiang population and the entities surpassing those people were part of the making of this movie. Found that out after already buying unreturnable tickets."
2036,"I was excited about this movie. I enjoyed the original animation as an asian kid, and I didn't cared that they wanted to remove Mushu and the songs. I am fine with an adaptation that wanted to be historically precise, realistic and more appealing to non-Western audiences. Yet, what they deliver are stunning visuals devoid of any meaning.The dialogues are dry, the transitions are poorly executed, and there is little to no character development. Supporting characters have no purpose, and not a single arc between them and Mulan is properly concluded. They reference asian kung-fu movies through pastiche photography, without really understanding how asian cinema conveys its messages. Not to mention their complete failure in attempting to make battles look more realistic through clean soldiers and not a single drop of blood. It is raw and infantile at the same time, fused into something that is embarassing.It is very unfortunate that in an attempt to make justice to the richness of Chinese culture, they delivered a generic, unrelatable, and shallow movie like this one."
2037,"Already there was a fantastic version of this out then disney brought their magic with the 1998 animated version... this does appeal more to those who haven't watched the original or animation. I think if the great Bruce Lee were alive he would have a part in this and it would still be watchable.
Not too bad but I wouldn't watch it over and over like I do most Disney"
2038,"I was expecting something EPIC, but what I got is almost 2 hours of what should have been the first 15 minutes. Also, not enough fighting,. They should have made 2 versions of the movie, one for kids and one filled with violence and blood. This had potential to be a great movie, instead they made another film for little kids. So Desapointing."
2039,"With the low budget and putting into too much of the Religion, it seems like a comedy and fantasy movie for children.
Obviouly this is so gross compared to Prince of Persia. A big dissapointing. I have wait for this for too long."
2040,"Its a 5/10 movie, the story is way worse then the old cartoon. people that havent watched the old cartoon might like this movie. but the witch in but skipping Mushu was a big mistake for me. Li Gong did a fine job but it was for me the witch just did not fit. Yifei Liu did a good job as Mulan i found her believable and a fine actress, how they found out about her being mulan was again better and more cool in the cartoon. i very much liked Yoson An as Honghui but his story was so much better in the cartoon and the story between Mulan and Li Shang made that story so much better so changing out Li Shang for Honghui was a mistake. think Yoson would have done a very good job as Li Shang and Jason Scott Lee was just bad as Böri Khan and changing the story from Shan Yu again a mistake for me. simply a better character so i dont blame JSL for the acting i think thats more the character and direction then the actingso to end my rantCartoon in every way better
its a movie i will not watch again because i like a good story and this is simply not a good version of the story.
its well filmed but i got more the vibe crouching tiger hidden dragon then mulan and i wanted to watch a mulan movie"
2041,"Honestly speaking, i do prefer the animated original version of 1998 to this movie, because it was abit of comedy with the dragon and the cricket... This movie lacks a whole lot and i personally didn't see the use for the phoenix except just flying around and why not just adapt the cartoon as it is into a movie."
2042,"If you were looking for a live action adaptation of Mulan, then you'll be sorely disappointed. All things Disney were removed so we could be presented with a generic movie such as we have all seen before. My expectations was to see the original movie with real people, perhaps with some minor modifications. What I got was an entirely different story. Thus comparing to its original animated version, the movie would barely get a 1/10 at best.That said, if you come with no expectations and don't compare it to the original, you may be able to rate it a 7/10. It could go higher but they have some issues with character development and there are just too many things that felt forced.I'll hope that in the future we'll be able to see a live action version that includes a little Disney magic. Until then, we're stuck with this one. It can be enjoyable as long as you're not comparing or expecting much."
2043,"I had to revive my account just so I can give a review of this movie lol. This is one, or if not my most favorite Disney movie, and I really had high hopes for the action film. Sadly, it didn't live up to my expectations.Here are some points that I like from the film:
I love that they give more importance to the ""True"" virtue by relating it to Mulan's storyline. The original didn't emphasize this muchThe setting, although still not accurate, looks better than the originalFor the cons:
The acting was monotonous and not that good. I get that Mulan's maybe an introvert, but the actress' eyes and gestures should show what she feels even if there are no lines. Like the scene where she flew from above with her sword. Where are the emotions in your eyes???The characters. I don't feel connected to the characters. I didn't know them, and the fact that there's no music to introduce them made me feel that they're just background characters and nothing more. Also, the sister is unnecessary. She was just used as a character who would ruin Mulan's encounter with the matchmaker lolThe weaving of the story. a) The film did not highlight how the other soldiers got better in fighting. Not one died in the fight in the end. How??? b) Also, the story arc with the witch is kinda meh. It was just put there as an ornament, and not an important part of the movie. c) Her decision to go to war instead of his father was not highlighted at all. The scene just cut to her riding the horse with her armor on.The love story arc. It's a good thing that the movie did not dwell much in the love story arc of Mulan, but her connection with the new guy kinda seemed forced. It didn't feel organic to me. I just wish that they alloted more time for the two to develop feelings for each other.Overall, the film is still enjoyable. But, if I were to choose which version do I like better, I'd still choose the animated one."
2044,I hate all these live action disney movies that are word for word as the cartoon... this was a breath of fresh air... only thing I can say is it would have been nice to have the dragon Mushu in it... cheers
2045,"This movie is one of the few live action movies from Disney that felt the same yet different. I was skeptical at first, but after watching i can say i really enjoyed it. it makes sense that the movie was edited and adapted from it original, it more true to the culture. This is one of there legends and Disney adapted it for a kids movie, and became one of Disney classics. than many years later did another adaptation of it. they changed the movie based of feed back from people whose culture it is. would you rather have more movies like the lion king live action, or something that had the balls to give you a different tale. its not perfect, but i'd rather support and watch this than get more Disney sell out remakes where its the exact same story. Do you want to raise your kid watching original movies, with creativity and diversity. Or would you like a live action remake of Simba's pride? this movie has beautiful scenery that shows how divers china's landscape is."
2046,"If set your expectation accordingly Mulan 2020 is actually quite enjoyable.But for me, I watched it ONLY because they've branded it as not a ""re-make"" but a completely different movie. I was a little disappointed. I think the original ""Ballad of Mulan"" is a story that's powerful enough -- does't need to add a flying witch or weird interpretation of ""Chi""."
2047,"I would have given this a 9/10 had they just sung the songs. 10/10 if Mushu was there.I didn't even mind all the updates to the plot, the witch and the women sticking up for women stuff was great. The action scenes were awesome.But this is a DISNEY PRINCESS MOVIE, not an action movie. Sing I'll make a man out of you and reflection. Watched half the movie with my arms crossed I was so not impressed."
2048,"How not to review is giving it a 10/10 and just asking the people to ""watch and enjoy"".They used the name Mulan to remind us what this movie is supposed to be, but it never is. It has all the classic elements of martial art movies like Crouching tiger hidden dragon, house of flying daggers, hero... Minus the effort put into the plot. Okay, this is supposed to be a ""live action remake"" of a classic.
They couldn't put a dragon but they include a witch who shape shifts. But that's not even the problem.If this was an average action adventure movie with top asian stars and martial arts, it's an okay movie. But this is called Mulan. And there is no respect shown towards the legend of the warrior Mulan and the original animated movie which will be the reason that someone is spending money to watch this on tv.
There's zero character development for most characters, even the warrior who grows through hardship into the final form is not shown, it's just using the chi which was always there since her childhood. The witch basically has no critical application towards the turning point.This isn't a bad movie. It's enjoyable. But it's not Mulan. I'm not even comparing the two otherwise this would get something like 4/10...this is a basic action adventure movie with names like Jet Li, Donnie Yen, Crystal Liu and a basic plot, scenes which are added for visual treats and the warrior lady saves the day (which they did a decent ending and she did it humbly without uttering any cringy lines. But unfortunately, not empowering as the original but better than Captain Marvel of course!)... Grab some popcorn. Okay movie. Not worth the price though."
2049,"Could be better. I expected more.
It was a good movie overall"
2050,"There are many people think movie is not good, but it's okay because they all may to comment for a good reason and motivation. But i think Mulan is still good and i love to watch it, i very appreciate for the director and other crue that made this film. Rating is not all about the film is worth it for watch or not, i hope we can be more appreciate for everthing effort crue of this film. Thanks"
2051,"Look ignore the review bombers, the movie was great overall. It has a great cast great dialogue and decent action. The fact that Disney did not cater to the fans by addingba dragon sidekick was a smart move."
2052,"Really. People these days really need to start thinking for themselves. This is not a live action remake of the 90's animation. And that's all what I am going to say about reviews bringing that up as argument.
That said, the movie has its good moments, but some blatant flaws as well.The movie is based to the original material, yeah the legend novel. Mulan IS a kind of a Chi chosen one in the legend tale, ok?But Mulan also shows her intelligence in a strong scene where she uses her pure wits to win a battle and save the most part of her regiment. There are also emotional moments and a strong message that permeates the story throughout the movie. However it is all done in a pace that does not seem natural. Strong scenes cut to a dozens of seconds, no time to develop the majority of characters to make a real connection to them and even to remember their names. Some flashback scenes of the so called ""last great battle"" would greatly improve the the antagonist weight.And last, but not least, the whole magic question. To strip it of Mushu and Cricket and the songs was a smart move to make it more a drama and not mock on the legend. But to make it up with a shapeshifting, doppelganger witch to fulfill the role was really a valid choice? In my, opinion, no. And her cheap and foolish death is the best proof of that. She is completely expandable to the story.
I would give it a 7 but, personally, I was only aware Donnie Yen and Jet Li were in the movie when the credits rolled up. And not because of the characterizations, but, again, for the lack of development."
2053,"I've read quite a few reviews... I'm surprised... while it is nothing like the original animated classic, it's not bad. It's not a carbon copy (cut for cut crap like the lion king). Mulan was one of my favorite movies growing up, yes the music was fab and it was hilarious... but really I think generally it was b/c she was so brave and a badass.. and here we are, that's the same. I love seeing them focus on the beauty of Chinese culture, landscape. I enjoyed it and will be watch it again!"
2054,"I'm glad I read some of the reviews here warning that this is not the original. Don't expect the songs, etc. But if you go in with an open mind & watch it as a movie all it's own, it's quite enjoyable. Beautiful scenery, good acting, entertaining fight scenes! I will watch it again! Worth the $30!"
2055,Disney should have a selected a director that was familiar with shooting action. Better yet Disney should have hired a director who specialized in action. The director they selected has only done drama work and it shows. Donnie Yen and Jet Li were criminally underutilized and poorly shot. Set pieces were lackluster. The cast was the best part. The film was just Ok. It should have been better. Too bad Ang Lee passed on directing this film.
2056,"I really love it... I really like it... it was fun, emotional, great graphics... it's a movie for a nice afternoon... Not all movies have to be Oscar winners, sometimes you just want to relax, enjoy and have a good time."
2057,"I genuinely believe that outside of biology, men and women are people and people pretty much the same. Some people think cilantro taste like soap, some people put it on everything.
The old way of keeping women in women roles was hit upon greatly in act 1. But it didn't deliver. In act 2 it built up this sentiment by coupling it with the high goals of honesty and truth as means to honor your family, your clan, your country. In act 3 it just turned on a dime as though nothing from act 1 or 2 had any bearing. The powers that be just said, ""welp, guess we will give you the keys to the kingdom then since you didn't want to stay in your place."" WEAK SAUCE!In the cartoon it built on this idea by sparing mulan's life because she saved the captains life, but that she was hence forth banished. It was only when she went against that banishment at risk to her own life, that she taught the captain that even a woman could do right thing.So many things could have been done to enhance the message that women are equal...but if they wanted to just show that women are equally as powerful as men, then why play the gender card in acts 1 and 2. They could have just told a fictitious retooled version of mulan in which the army was already co-gendered. Done.But this movie took this otherwise powerful message and just flopped it. If I show this to young ladies and girls in my life, the only lesson I can teach them from this is that it's fiction and if you really believe in something you have to fight for it. Not just have all the opposition bow and curtsy to your defiance and cultural taboo behaviors.This is the only Disney Princess I liked because she felt real. This movie made her feel fake by making all the supporting cast treat her the way they did when she revealed who she really was.But the kung fu was good."
2058,"Ignore all the bad reviews on here! This film is quite simply breath taking. The action/scenery/cinematography/acting is all great! The re telling of this story should not be compared to the animated original film. Having read some negative reviews, I did not know what to think before viewing. But I'm glad to say this made me feel happy to be a Disney and Mulan fan.
Unlike a carbon copy of Lion King, this re telling has heart and if you enjoyed Aladdin's joyous and colourful outfits and sets you will not be disappointed! The fantasy element had just the right balance and did go over the top. I'm rather glad this is on Disney+ and for £19.99 I think this is very reasonable as you would likely spend similar if going to the cinema! 10/10!"
2059,"The movie lacks soul, class and the power of the original. The whole movie just feels cheap and synthetic. They had the potential to make such an amazing epic yet this fell flat on it's face. The special effects and choreography lacked realism and felt very fake. The character development was also nonexistent. Yet another pointless remake from Disney. Don't waste your time watching it."
2060,What are you doing Disney Seriously. Would not even guess this was Mulan not for a second. I was not expecting a screen for screen representation of the Original but come on. You removed beloved characters changed her ancestors and didn't even have a single song in it. It didnt feel like a Disney movie even not in the slightest maybe a second rated kung foo movie at best. Dont even get me started on witch craft and spells. Disney you have totally missed the mark.
2061,"I knew going into this that nothing would ever compare to the original cartoon musical, but this was just plain B-A-D; bad. It felt like I was watching an early 2000s' Chinese martial arts drama but without the story.
I'm going to compare this version to the original a lot but bare with me. In the original, Mulan take her fathers place to go to war in order to save him and show that she is stronger and more determined than any man; but in the live action, she has....powers? This totally cheapens the story and contradicts the fact that they got rid of Mushu to make the story more ""realistic"". Also, there's a witch with the power to turn into a bird and a human but she chooses to be a side kick to Khan. Just why? In the original, Mulan cuts her hair and drops her voice real low to make her seem like a man. In this one, she just ties up her hair and drops her voice like 1 octave. She looks AND sounds exactly like a woman!
No disrespect but the actress was so mis-casted. She showed virtually no emotion and sounds like she was reading off of a cue card.
Honestly if the witch wasn't in the movie, I don't think anything would've changed. She really didn't bring much to the table and sacrificed herself for no reason.
All in all, this movie was a huge let down and is by far the worst of the Disney remakes. If they did a Lion's King shot for shot, it would've made this 100 times more enjoyable."
2062,"Aladdin was bad, but still acceptable, but you really messed up now. Don't try to explain yourselves, just apologize to our generation and, please, don't mess up our classics anymore."
2063,Don't watch this movie if your looking to watch a romantic Disney musical. This is an exciting martial arts film that tells the story of Mulan. It's just as good if not better than the original.
2064,"The action scenes, the story and the emotions are devoid of any feelings. Tears were delivered with a blank face and almost all, of not everyone had blank emotions on their faces, especially Mulan. It was like I'm watching a B-class Chinese film. All the emotions and character building that the original movie had was extinguished by theisie. THIS IS ONE HORRIBLE REMAKE, if anyone even dares to call it a remake. This movie can now rest in peace beside ""The Last Airbender""."
2065,"Highly recommend movie, I don't know why the rating is so low. Maybe everyone watch it in the small tv screen.😑"
2066,"Skip this movie , not worth 30 dollars just a cash grab if you really wanna see it wait until is free. Mulan is not likeable not smart , just a plain dull character."
2067,"I remember the animation of this movie and it was great. Especially the music, the laughs, and the thrills. This movie needs to be looked at in a different perspective. It sets up a different tone. Almost making it like a real life story. This is the only movie I will accept as live action. My biggest concern is this movie needs to be on a big screen. It is not good that Covid-19 ruined the big screen experience, $30 isn't worth watching on your phone, however I am grateful to have watched this movie. It was unique. Just remember the animation and live action is completely separate. Please do not compare them both. They both are good, just in a different perspective and tone."
2068,"I watched 1998 Disney, 2009 China and this 2020 Disney versions. Kids outside China will love the 1998 version which was comical and fun. The China version is serious and boring but delivered Mulan's character more realistically.However, i like this 2020 version the best from Disney. I love the background scenery, exciting fighting, mesmerizing use of colors, great acting from YiFei and fantastic surround sound effects. 2 hours seems to past much very fast. It should had been a 2.5 hrs film to explain more details fully. This film seems like a rush."
2069,Christina Aguilera is the best thing in this poor excuse of movie.
2070,"It was TERRIBLE! The acting was awful, the story was awful. I tried to pretend I've never seen the original and rate this on its own, and it sucks. There was ZERO comedy, there was no singing/songs. Don't spend the money to watch this. It isn't worth it."
2071,"At least do some homework of Chinese history and geography ... Or watch some film of Zhang Yimou, plz!"
2072,"Its really bad, unwatchable. Only thing good about it is i can see Daddy Donny Yen."
2073,"This is the only movie that worse than your life. If you think your life is a joke, then watch this one."
2074,"The animated Mulan movie was a little flawed but an interesting film with beautiful drawings, and humour. This movie is none of these things, replace any theme in the original instead with 'Chi' aka the force, new made up characters, Mulan is now mean who plays tricks on her 'sister' (was there even a sister in the original?), disobeys anyone older or wiser than her and is a general moron.The spirit woman and the army invading the lands don't make any sense in this movie and the backdrop of war and the loss of life is completely lost in this version.There are lots of close up shots of the way of life and costumes, etc, but nothing original added for this film. This is basically an otherwise generic Chinese action film and strip away the title you wouldn't have known. This is a core failing of the writing team and the production as a whole.The visuals are pretty poor, which is bizarre given the reach of Disney, it looks like poorly composted blue screen footage, especially the spiritual stuff/ghosts/transforming forms. In addition the lighting is poor, despite the colours showing through sometimes. There happens to be way too much fake 'HDR' filter rubbish all over the footage, making everything that little more dull and hard to see.Where is Eddie Murphy or the Mushu dragon character? They went out of their way to add old world/new age 'chi' garbage into this film but they cant add the cute little dragon family ancestor?Also now it is a phoenix flapping about the wind as a vision that disappears... who cares? Enough, view at your own risk and burden your wallet at your own discretion.I give it a 3/10 as a less than average disappointing and somewhat aggravating watch."
2075,"So I saw this with my sister at her house... on her Disney+ account... no way in hell I was going to pay $30 for this... and my verdict for this film is that while I appreciate that they actually tried to deviate a bit more from the 1998 film (unlike another particular Disney remake that we won't speak of), this film is pretty much what you would expect out of a Disney remake. The fact of the matter is that this film actually did have a lot going for it, especially considering that they changed so much about the story, but at the end of the day, it's just another soulless cashgrab of a remake. Character development was quite shallow, a lot of the editing in the action sequences was really bad, the pacing of the story was uneven, and overall it's such a letdown. To be honest, I had some hope from this movie because the film didn't seem like another shot-for-shot remake (UNLIKE ANOTHER DISNEY REMAKE THAT WE WON'T SPEAK OF), but I'm honestly not impressed with the final product nor am I surprised by my disappointment in the slightest. Deep down, I knew this movie was going to be mediocre.Disney is successfully conning people who worship the Mouse out of $30 for a single mediocre film. Blu-Ray + DVD + Digital combo packs are not even $30. At this point, I wonder how far Disney will go to make buck and how many people will fall for it."
2076,"I needed to watch the original version right after, just to rinse off the bitterness left in my mouth. In this movie, Mulan is born with a little somethin' somethin' that she had to keep hidden from the rest of her family because you know - patriarchy. Once she realized she should release her inner goddess - things get done. No heroes journey, no effort made to acquire skills needed for battle - nothing.
I can ignore the lack of charisma in almost all characters and a lot of pathetic humorless scenes but...
In the original version, Mulan was a confused awkward child that used her smarts and worked really hard to deserve the position and respect in the army. New Mulan was born with it. The cartoon depicts a true battle for equality girls like me needed while growing up while the new movie reruns the same idea from Disney's Star Wars - entitled protagonist.
""Make a man out of you"" is maybe the most inspiring song I ever heard, it can give me the energy to start learning for the hardest exam, start boxing, go to war, build myself a house, become an astronaut...
The new movie teaches me to... be nice to my personal witch, she may betray me otherwise."
2077,"With a movie that mentions honor so much it lacks it all together, this a such a disgrace to Disney's original adaptation of Mulan. None of the true meaning of the original is here and it's just an soulless cash grab with brainless action."
2078,"This film takes a perpetual downturn from the very beginning after it's stated that Mulan has an excess of 'chi' and is not just a quirky, clumsy, funny girl that is also brave, courageous, and earns her skill through perseverance and training. I understand the remake is meant to be different, but if they see making women protagonists unrelatable as different then this movie borders on frustrating.
The Good
Sometimes the score plays notes from the 1998 versionThere were 1-2 funny momentsMulan's stored energy/chi/force-like action scenes were pretty badass (only reason for 1 star)End creditsThe Bad
Sometimes the score only plays notes from the 1998 version; need more as Mulan (1998) arguably has the best Disney soundtrack of all timeThere were only 1-2 funny moments; almost zero comedic reliefWill constantly find ways to pull you out of it and suspend reality with obviously bad/implanted CGI and jump cutsBad actingBad editingBad screenplayBad directingOverall, you will come away from this feeling like it's a massive money grab from Disney and will have soured the taste of Mulan to all fans of the 1998 version. Not even worth pirating, let alone $30 on $10 monthly service. Please do your best to ignore your nostalgia bug and avoid at all costs."
2079,"Cannot set a precedence here of paying for titles on a paid streaming service, sorry the film has to pay for it"
2080,"I am a chinese, living in a chinese community, speaks and appreciates my culture, and I hate this movie. It's ok if Mulan acts all serious and rigid, because that's chinese, but what the frick is up with all this magic godlike power? it's like you cannot decide to make this realistic and historically accurate or fantasy and literal parody. what message are you trying to give? that someone has to be born special? Mulan was a normal person who fought at equal grounds among men, disguised as a man, and earn respect without all this magical lies. I hate this. uninspiring. and discriminating actual effort for born legend. only people born with special golden/diamond spoon should watch this and relate."
2081,It's a beautiful telling of the story of Mulan. Of course it's not the classic cartoon but you should look at it as an entirely different take on the story. Listen for music interweaving throughout from the original. Give it a chance.
2082,"I gave the movie a 10/10, because I don't think it deserves a low rating from others. But My rating of it is 8/10. It's a good movie, it's different from the animated classic that's why I liked it. A lot of people are saying that they hate it for changing so much. That's the reason for the remake. I don't want another movie where the scenes and also how we knew Mulan is the same as the animated movie. The story is the same but there are added parts that I really like and I think was really interesting. Although I agree that it's kinda like star wars where the chi is the force. That's okay, it gives more chinese culture to it. That doesn't mean she's not using her intelligence and determination. She is still using it, but the chi helps her to be more stronger. It is still a fantasy, but for me it's good. I'm not degrading women, but women are often not as strong as men so it would be very weird if she's really that strong than other men. Even if she was trained when she was a child or training by herself alone she maybe strong but not as stronger as a men. So that's why it made sense adding the chi. The story is really good. But I wished when training the ""I'll make the man out of you"" music is better and nostalgic. It's okay for the movie to not be musical but on scenes like that at least the musical score of the animated songs would be great! They added the music when she was preparing for the matchmaking but did not added the ""I'll make the man out of you"" score. And also there are some scenes that a little gappy. Like when she encountered the witch, and when she went back to the war, I think they should add more scenes of how did she got there and also when she was shooting arrows at the enemy behind them, how did she got there?Mulan is it's own movie. I really liked it but still it's not perfect. For those who are comparing it too much from the animated classic I disagree with them. I watched other reviews saying that they got bored? At the beginning I never got bored. I was very entertained while observing the movie. I can see it's pros and cons. But I don't think it's a bad movie. I was not disappointed. The only disappointment for me was Beauty and the Beast and I watched it on cinemas. THAT I fell asleep and it's because it's the same, scene by scene for most of the part.Watch it and if you don't like it. That's okay. We all have our own preferences. I like both They are the same but different. A beautiful remake that gave justice to the original.But still I'm hoping for an extended version of the movie when released in blu ray. I don't care how long. The 2hrs was still not enough for me."
2083,"It is both a disaster to Chinese and foreign audience. The score in China is only 4.8/10. It didn't have the classic elements of Disney's animation, also, those so call Chinese elements are fake. The MakeUp is from Japan, and the translation of Chinese poem is so strange. The director know nothing about Chinese culture and she even try to give up the beautiful things in animation. And Liu Yifei, except the appearance, she never knows what is acting. For more than ten years, she still try to play different roles in one face."
2084,"If you are expecting a remake of the animated movie, you are going to be very disappointed, the movie does allude to certain part of the animated movie but it has it's own premise and it is pretty well executed.
The movie has traditional chinese film style with values being centered and fight scenes including cable work, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan or Jet Li style.
The cinematography is superb and the scenery and costuming is amazing!
Give the movie an honest try and you might just find yourself loving it."
2085,"I liked the original and I love this one. From the first time I saw the trailers for this movie I was very excited. It didn't disappoint in my opinion. Great action and great story. Instead of just remaking the original movie, same lines and plot. It was its own movie just on the original. Not similar to the rest of the live action remakes. No singing or musical numbers. Which is okay with me. I hope Disney makes more movie similar to this. Not sure about all these bad reviews."
2086,The cartoon was made to be an animation a rare example of Disney drawing on real history. The live action version is solid they discarded what would look ridiculous and stuck to the story of a woman having the courage to go against tradition to be true to herself. What do you want to see a CGI mushu? Disney nailed this live action version absolutely fantastic don't compare enjoy as an authentic story
2087,"Not bad, it entertains, but it lacks of feeling, not as much action i was expecting, but it cant be compared as the original animation, but what i have to admit that visual effects and scenes are pretty good pleasant to the eyes and the music is also good, in few words, not the best but it works to spend time in family"
2088,This Disney classic has a new spin- they geared it to older children and adults. It still had some of the Disney feel of the original movie yet it was a unique stand alone and was in my opinion a very good movie. It made women the Center of the plot for the good side and the bad side and it didn't make the story about how a woman needs a man. She came of age and chose her own path. Wonderful job! You simply can't compare it to the original- it's not the same movie. Mulan was always my favourite Disney movie and this one did not disappoint. There are a few minor things I would have changed as far as music went - but minor in the grand scheme of things. All and all I loved the movie.
2089,"How about for a 2nd part?!😁
All actors done a great job!🤗"
2090,"I was expecting a lot from this action remake as Mulan is one of my favourite. Despite a great cast and beautiful scenery the film lacks everything. Particularly songs. I think. The animation version was at least joyful.
I'd rather watch the Chinese version (2009) of it which is a 1000 times better and pays both homage to the heroine and her identify without forcing the cultural brief."
2091,"Luckily, my Covid ""support bubble"" means 2 preteens are allowed around and they rented it and it was beautiful. Very different from the other one, of course, but from an artistic perspective this was worth my time. The kids seemed to like it, also. Story isn't good, bad, it's fine but the detail, action, and artistry made this worthwhile. I needed something different and this filled the void."
2092,The movie is incredible. I enjoyed every bit of it. And I hated how someone like Mulan was judged by her sex not by her worth. It is not new to us that we had a very long history of oppression based on male hierarchy that had no foundation but fear and the need to control. I'm a man and I hate it. A lot of people seems to compare this with the animation but do no get stuck with the past. It's better to move on and see how this movie brings a beautiful story in a very complex settings that is the Chinese culture. I really loved this one better than The Lion King and Beauty and The Beast. They took a risk on something new and in my opinion succeeded. The more people watch it the better the rating will get for this movie. It is indeed an everlasting story that touches deeply what means to be a human. Thank you Yifei Liu for being our Mulan.
2093,"No matter what you guys think how terrible it is, I LOVE this! Same as my wife!
Moved! Rated 10/10!"
2094,I loved it!!! Ok missed Mushu and he was one of the missing pieces that needed to be in and a few other stuff but I didn't expect to like it so much.
2095,"Before we watch this version. My daughter and I watched the cartoon original... She loved it (shes 4.5 btw) and then back to back we also watch this movie.. she said mulan is very preety, her kung fu skill way better than the cartoon. But even a 4 years old can say that the movie to short and the story seems like rushed...and she hates it because no singing like the other disney remakes... So she decide to give this movie a 6..."
2096,"I love the authenticity! It sticks to the old Chinese Poem Hua Mulan. Those hate comments probably came from Hong Kong supporters, they hate the actress because she's Chinese."
2097,"Mulan is one of my favorite Disney animated films so I was ecstatic when I heard a live action remake was coming. I was so disappointed when it was pushed back due to a Covid-19. I finally forked out the $30 to see it through Disney plus and I regret to say, the live action film left very much to be desired. In my opinion, Disney made a tremendous mistake straying from the original animated story and eliminating the iconic songs and characters. I'm all for making a movie more historically accurate, but the movie appeared to attempt to take a more realistic approach which is one of the main aspects working against it. If they wanted a more serious and realistic approach, the storyline, acting and fight scenes needed to be stepped up significantly. The story of Mulan could have pulled off being written as an epic with large armies, further character development, a darker villain, increased action and intense fight scenes. But the live action attempt completely failed to make an epic action movie creating something boring and pretty bland. If they didn't want to push the envelope with more violence and maturity, they should have stuck with what worked for the animated version. The entire appeal of Disney is to bring ""magic"" and music. ""Make a Man Out of You"" is one of the best Disney songs of all time! Why they bothered adding the supernatural component of the witch and Phoenix and removing Mushu was beyond me. It would have been amazing to see him in cgi and he would have brought some much needed comic relief to the movie that would have made up for the lazy plot, boring scenes, underwhelming action scenes, and poor acting. I also found myself inserting where a song should have went during certain scenes of the movie. The character development was also extremely poor. Jet Li sounded robotic reciting his lines and for a second, I wondered if his speaking parts were voice overs. They significantly under utilized a strong martial arts actor there. The actress playing Mulan actually fit the role well, but they failed her with what she was given to work with. She came off like a jerk for risking her life and her family's honor just to prove a woman could do better than what a man could instead of coming off like a selfless girl trying to protect her ailing father. I don't entirely regret watching, but I wouldn't watch again. Definitely don't spend $30 on this. Wait to watch when it is added to Disney Plus's regular roster. Man, these live actions started out so promising with the great Jungle Book, good Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin, but The Lion King and Mulan were mediocre, perhaps even downright bad."
2098,"As an Asian. I am very proud Disney can bring Mulan to my real life. I think rotten tomatoes gave it a CERTIFIED 80 score is very reasonable. It is worth $30 dollars of course.The senses are very beautiful. I now understand why it costs 200M dollars. And the actions are so cool, Very interested to see everyone's reaction when they see the movie at home or theatre. Although the whole story changed a lot from Disney Mulan 1998 but I still can see the same Mulan in every sense. The actor is very beautiful when she fights with the enemy. Even it is a action movie but children can still see very happy.Compared to origianl Mulan. her femail identity is been found in the middle of the movie. But that is what I think the most excited moment for this whole movie. A femail so brave to show who she is, face her fear and save her friends. Even she may be killed by her identity but nothing can stop her. That theme is more appropriate to current Hallwood trendency.Any way, I think it is the best Live-action Disney princess movie I ever seen. It is worth when you arrange a movie day with your familiy. Or enjoy with your friend. Thank you Disney. Thanks"
2099,"This being my 3rd Mulan movie, not counting the sequel to the cartoon movie. So my review is based on a comparison between the cartoon Mulan movie and the Chinese live action MulanIf you liked the Disney cartoon of Mulan, you'll probably enjoy it. They even turned some of the song lyrics from the cartoon version into dialogue and rewrote some of the key combat sequences to make more sense in a live action movie. On the other hand, if you've seen the Chinese live action Mulan, then this will fall well short of the mark for you.They replaced the dragon with a bird which honestly, they could have done without. It's more complicated than just changing critters for kicks, but I'm trying not to give away the reason for using this particular bird... Thankfully, it was a very minor and limited plot device. Slightly more egregious though, is the addition of another unnecessary character to fulfil a similar role.The combat is VERY wuxian. So, if you liked the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Dragon Blade fight sequences then you'll enjoy the fight scenes in Mulan. Lots of gravity defying FX and altogether unbelievable fighting techniques. But hey! It's a fantasy movie set in ancient China, so the action is standard fare.I do have to give it props for being a great movie for kids, especially girls. That whole inspirational, ""you can overcome everything life throws at you"" theme comes out better than in the cartoon. I actually added a star just for this.My issue with this film is that even though it's live action, it still feels like the cartoon version of Mulan. It lacks the gritty realism of the Chinese Mulan and the pace is sort pretty quick. My impression is that corners were cut with the plot because it is essentially a remake that most people know. Every familiar scene seems a bit clipped. Even the combat scenes are relatively brief for a live-action action film. Character development is minimal except for Mulan herself. You almost need to rewatch the cartoon movie so you can understand some of the important characters and sub-plots.As for the cast.... and what a cast! Excellent performances all around! I have to say that the casting department did a top notch job.I'm giving this version of Mulan 7 stars. The writing and directing is just too lazy to warrant more stars even in spite of the excellent acting and special effects. Since it is largely based on the cartoon movie there just isn't enough new content to oooh and aaah over. I also realize that many people reading this have never seen the Chinese version of Mulan. So, if my rating seems a little low, then my recommendation is to go find the better, grittier Chinese version for context."
2100,"I don't know what it is but Disney can't make great live action movies. If anyone else made this movie it could be considered pretty decent but it was very boring as a Disney movie where you expect a level of whimsy and emotion. They basically spent all that money to make a typical Chinese martial arts war movie. For that you can pic any authentic Chinese movie off of Netflix for free and be equally entertained as their costumes, sets and action are just as good.They removed the songs ostensibly to make it more realistic but I think they did it because they're now considered non-politically correct. Even the gender reveal was politically corrected to give Mulan agency or something. I guess that's not bad in and of itself but it made the film boring and unsuspenceful.Also Mulan had super powers from the beginning and was guided by a phoenix instead of talking dragon. That direction in and of itself wasn't bad but the way it was implemented was lack luster. Also if you think about it, it gives the idea that women aren't equal fighters unless they have super powers rather than through hard work?The sum of my review though is basically that it's very frustrating because they did a lot in the film but not of lot of the things the audience actually wanted. Oh well, we keep giving them out money so they think it's ok.🤷‍♂️"
2101,"No waste! The movie has an excellent plot and story, and the best part is that it is different than the original movie."
2102,The bad reviews are based on this version of Mulan being not like the original but there were alot of remakes that were good and not like the original.In my opinion remakes are not supposed to be all like the original.
2103,"This movie could not arrive at a better time. Equity and the lessons that all humans should learn and follow told in a story that needs no humor from the animated version of this movie.
Watch this movie not to see the animated movie. This story is far more enriched story. The actors are impressive at every position. Watch to see the structure of how the story is told in a different manner. I am looking forward to watching this with my children just as we did with the animated version. Real world is better."
2104,"This movie barely gets a, ""7,"" and that is being very generous!
The movie is visually stunning along with the beautifully designed production representing the Chinese culture. It has an All-Star cast of Asian/Asian-American actors and actresses.
However, much of this movie could have been figured out by watching this trailer. This movie is missing one of its biggest characters that made the original movie, Mushu! The fact Eddie Murphy is still alive and could have played this role makes it even more upsetting, yet they are able to add a witch to the movie. Really upsetting the movie it missing some of its pivotal characters from the original back in (1988)."
2105,"I love this telling of the story of Mulan. Realistic, no goofy dragon or cricket flitting around. I don't know the legend, but this is a far better telling than the animated one. Will see it again and again!"
2106,"I've never seen the animated version so can't comment however this was a decent watch. I did notice that the film got loads of bad reviews on launch however I have to say these might have been influenced by the left wing agenda on the main actress. Anyway.......a decent film, maybe not worth the £20 PPV though."
2107,"The original was definitely better. I felt like the dialog and script in the movie was pretty bad and felt forced. There was no funny or comedic elements like the original had. I also think they really should have had Mushu and the original characters. It wasn't a horrible movie, i just think it could have been way better."
2108,"I kinda liked the new scenes that were not in the original movie. It's pretty good.
I'm just bumped that I don't get to see mushu, mulan's grandma AND SHANG :( They're the ones who made the movie alive and fun.And I get why they split shang's character to two different characters here.
But the interaction between mulan and honghui was too short. It would be nice to see that iconic ending scene in the original movie where mulan asked shang to stay for dinner and her grandma in the background shouted ""Can you stay forever?""I wish the ending was different in the remake. But I still enjoyed watching this movie.
Good job to all the actors and actresses!"
2109,"I really don't know where to begin as there are just too many ""bads"" to talk about. No intention to waste anyone's time to read me ranting so just bullet points:1. Bad costume design and quality (Looks like they are tight on budget)
2. Bad research and language translation
3. Bad casting other than the lead and Donnie Yen
4. Bad graphics
5. Bad plot and screenplay
6. Bad battle scene
7. Bad ""Chi"" - Overkill of the use of ""Chi"" and makes me wonder if the Director knows what the hell is Chi! LOLDisney should do just children's movie and leave the grown up movies to the others.*P/s: The 4th virtue engraved on the sword means filial piety and not ""devotion to family""!!! Duh!"
2110,"Watched it with no expectations and just allows myself to be taken into this beautiful and immersive movie. I loved that it's different to the animation! Why would we want to watch the exact same thing? So what if it's different and there's no Mushu or Crikee? The production is beautiful, the costumes stunning and such a feast on the eyes. In my opinion, the lead did her role justice and the whole cast was great. Not sure what people are complaining about, honestly. So much hard work and love was poured into it and it shows! I saw a reviewer call the worst movie of 2020? Wow, really? That's very low and uncalled for! I watched it with another group of family, we were all thoroughly entertained for a Saturday night in. I urge everyone to watch it with an open mind... you'll enjoy it for sure."
2111,"I've read many negative reviews about the movie, so I decided to create an IMDb account to share my thoughts.
I loved the cartoon Mulan, I loved this live-action adaptation. Some things were different than the previous, but the core of the movie is the same. It is as heartwarming and inspirational. Great job to the actors and the film-makers."
2112,"Disney did lots of work in history background and details. The movie is quite close to the real story, which took place about two thousand years ago, when China was in chaos, the whole societies were in an era of wars, drugs, Buddhism and homosexuality. The rourans in the movie were true, the king had a name, the 6 frontier towns existed, the invasion of the capital happened.... Watch it, not only for entertainment."
2113,"Mulan 2020 is kinda of a mixed bag. There are some things about the movie that are fantastic while others that fall short. The original movie is a modern masterpiece but I feel this version lacked the heart and soul of the original. That being said, it's not bad at all. The visuals are breathtaking. Everything from the costumes, the colors, the sets, and action are so pretty too look at.The action scenes are unique. To explain, their clearly inspired by classic 60s and 70s Chinese martial arts movies. These films featured almost superhuman like characters just, well, because. As much as I appreciate this homage, I'm not sure it fit with the tone of the movie. That's another thing, the tone. It can't decide if it wants to be a serious war movie or a lighthearted action flick. The originals tone was lighthearted but perfectly balanced the seriousness of war and mortality. I feel that it would have been better if it took its subject matter more seriously.The acting was good as well. Donnie Yen steals the show as he's prone to do. It was great to see Jet Li again as well.the rest of the cast is solid to great. And there's a certain cameo at the end that made me really happy! The characters are fine but don't always have a lot to do or say. It should be noted that it is inspired by a different version of the Mulan legend. So that's why we have such big differences from the first, which in turn was inspired by a mother version.Mulan may be a mixed bag but I mostly enjoyed it. If you've seen and love the first one you're going to be much more critical. But if this is your first introduction then you may like it better. The visuals and technical achievements are so great they really save the movie."
2114,"I don't like how Disney is handling projects lately (ex. Star Wars trilogy) but I neither get the haters of this film. They do a frame-by-frame copy of the original you find it unoriginal, they spice it up a bit and you complain that it ruins the original!
I loved the first Mulan and this is a slightly different version that is just as great! Yifei Liu is perfect as Mulan, so is the music and the cinematography. The pace of the film keeps you interested and hooked at all times (at least I was). The only things I would change is the somewhat lack of humor and the existence of the witch which I found unnecessary.
Unlike other hero and Disney movies, the story of Mulan is centered 100% around the evolution of one protagonist and less around secondary characters or their dynamics. In this film, the lead actress did such an amazing job portraying Hua Mulan that it made the absence of other supporting characters like Mushu seem irrelative to me (and I love Mushu!).
To conclude, this film is worth 8 stars but I gave it 10 to balance the unfair 1star reviews.
P.S. Obviously it is not worth paying 30$ + subscription - I can't think of a movie that is when you can actually own it on a dvd after a few months and with less money."
2115,"Although Mulan is adapted from an ancient Chinese story and legend, Mulan's loyalty and bravery in fighting for his father and country has moved the whole world. The original Disney animation story has a little magic and magic color. Although the adaptation of the real-life version of the film is slightly weak in narrative, but the war scene in the film is grand and wonderful. The Mulan played by Liu Yifei is valiant and heroic in bearing, which is worth seeing. Mulan, the protagonist in the film, finally realizes her heart and becomes a real warrior, just like the theme song sings."
2116,Reading a lot of negative reviews - most are just trolls complaining about either how expensive it was (but forgot to check if they went to a movie theater it would cost the same plus you would see it only once) and how Disney has some sort of communist party agenda Cause of this year. I mean come on seriously? Mulan by Disney has been around for decades.I mean a kick azz female role was amazing - but some people in reviews seem to despise for whatever reason. Anyways...Now for the real meat - Beware Mulan fans. This is not exactly like the original cartoon series. So if that's what you're expecting then don't get mad. I actually liked it that way because otherwise it would be boring.There were parts of it like when Mulan saves the day but no one seemed to know about it - I wasn't happy about. Or if they did it was removed or skipped over. Anyways for a Mulan fan it was 9/10 as long as you understand it's different than the original.
2117,"First thing, dont trust the review. The film is way better and absolutely astonishing for me. The different storyline from the cartoon make us wondering about the next. This film is worth to watch 💪"
2118,"I have watched the original Mulán growing up and now this version. I loved that they didn't make an exact duplication of the movie like they did with The Lion King & Aladdin. The story, the music, the cinematography all kept me entertained until the end. I thought the message about strong women was great - and I didn't get the overwhelming pandering towards 'wokeness'. If you want to be entertained, watch a movie that you can enjoy with the kids, and finally see a remake the way Disney should have been making these remakes all along - then Mulan is the movie to watch!!"
2119,"It was safe to say, I was nervous about this one as it's my fav Disney movie getting turned into one of their live actions which I've not enjoyed in the past.The visuals were amazing, the cast were amazing and the instrumentals in the background were just spot on. This added its own twists to the classic tale I love and you know, I really enjoyed it.Niki Caro deserves all the credit! Fantastic Director."
2120,"You can think of it as a brand new movie, rather than compare it with the animation version, because it doesn't really make sense. Calm down to watch it, you will find the charm of the film, whether it is the performance of the leading actor, the scenery in the film, the theme of the film, are very, very good. In short, I was conquered by this Mulan. Instead of believing in other people's evaluation, why don't you use your own eyes and heart to feel it"
2121,"While still paying homage to the original I loved the changes they made. It's more accurate and really puts a lot more emphasis on the roles women had which makes Mulan's path that much more amazing and badass! The movie score, cinematography, casting, costumes, set was stunning."
2122,Really enjoyed every minute of the act.. The lovers of Martial Arts will treasure this release. Lovely scenes and costumes as well
2123,"I want to say, hey, it's a pity for you to miss this movie. I was completely conquered by Mulan. In the first half, I really regarded him as a handsome boy. He was so charming. You know, when I watched it on the computer, I wanted to rush into the screen and propose to him. I love him! When she became a girl, her beauty was amazing, the director's lens was very beautiful! Yifei Liu's martial arts are very good, the performance also let me cry a few times, Disney is worthy of Disney, the movie is really great!"
2124,"Disney has said time and time again that this is NOT a remake of their 90s film Mulan. But that this is a story that aligns more with the authentic tellings of Mulan.The fight sequences are beautiful and not full of blood and gore. The overall feel of the movie is of honor and family - something that is held in high regard in the Chinese culture (so it makes sense).Personally, I did miss the hint of romance That I would have loved but I appreciate how it was omitted because the soldiers view Mulan as their equal and therefore would not seek romance."
2125,"In a flash, I was greeted by the film's phenomenal and breathtaking cinematography. Stunning location, majestic scenery, detailed and colorful work of art altogether captures the whole aura of historic China. By then, my expectation were met in every sense of the word ""quality"". ""Oh, it's going to be a good one!"" I thought.For the most part I noticed the traditional or rather historical role the film creator was taking on when they omitted all of the animated film's musical and witty characters. Unfortunately but fortunately they kind of tweaked the story line just a tiny bit which I came to appreciate as you do not want to foresee every single detail from the classic animated film. I learned this from watching the remake of Lion King. Overall, the actress did a great job with her action-packed stunt sequence which was the highlight of the movie. The film creator successfully directed more of a significant film leading up to Mulan's journey rather than input the use of comedy as seen in the animated Mulan. It made sense. A must-see. I demand a Part 2.
P.S mushu is in there but not in a way you thought he was."
2126,"Comments from my children: it was awesome, really cool and kind of sad because of people dying and it had lots of skills, finally its not bad but its really great movie."
2127,"This is the best movie of the year! Liu Yifei's performance is exquisite and vivid, she has injected the soul to Mulan! The color and composition are really beautiful and will definitely shock you in the cinema! I have to say that the martial arts really sa! The story about Mulan and her father makes me cry. On the basis of the animation version to add new elements, and sublimation of the theme, the awakening of female power and loyalty and true spiritual core must be able to inspire many people! The theme song sung by Liu Yifei at the end of the credits really brought tears to my eyes!"
2128,We absolutely loved this version of Mulan! Definitely worth the wait 😍
2129,"With all Disney animated movies made to real life, to me they are doing a great job. Not every one of them can turn out like the animated ones, but the they do keep true to the spirit of the movie."
2130,It's beautifully beautiful. More movies should be as colorful and awesome like this movie. So please dont listen to all the hate cos its politically motivated. Worth watching.
2131,Absolutely loved this. If you've gone into this thinking it'll be the same as the original you will be disappointed but for me as stand alone movie it was absolutely outstanding
2132,"I can't believe some of these comments are complaining about paying 30 dollars for this movie. Like what does that have to do with the movie's content whatsoever? Too many hurt feelings in these reviews and not enough educated remarks.Let's me start of by saying the things I like about this film.
I liked the idea of having a witch in the movie.the attempt to accurately represent Chinese culture-the cinematographyThis is what I didn't like. The movie felt flat to me. What made the 1998 movie so compelling is the protagonist. In this version, Mulan is already close to perfect and honestly acts too much like a goody goody. This version struggles to make her relatable, which is one of the reasons why people fell in love with the Disney version to begin with. Another major flaw is the lack of character development. The side characters are just boring. Even the villain is boring and unimpressive. Let's get back to the topic of The Witch. The idea was great, but the execution was poor. Again, why do we care about these characters?I believe this film would've been better with a darker tone and some BLOOD. This is a war story for crying out loud. And I know they wanted to keep it family friendly, but they could've done it in a very MCU way. I found this version to be more mature, however, the tone wasn't dark enough to raise the stakes."
2133,"Great action scenes. Good to see a strong asian female lead in a movie.Good acting, easy to follow and nice nods to original."
2134,"A beautifully shot epic story; it has none of the musical elements, but it doesn't need them. If you compare it to the original from your childhood you'll be disappointed however the movie itself is a fresh look at Mulan's story."
2135,People are really expecting it to be just like the animated version and while I love the original version and I couldn't help my self to compare both while watching it I realized I really liked this version a lot. There are certain parts that were more effective in the original version like the outing of Mulan as a men and perhaps the way that Mulan came back to her father and apologized. But aside of that it was very well done and felt very much like watching an oriental style film. It was beautiful aesthetically and the action scenes looked very neat.
2136,"A little bit different than the original movie, but a good remake. No singing an not so childish...For me it was a good movie with good actors and a lot of action."
2137,Mulan is one of the best Disney princess. This movie represented the real Mulan.
2138,"The wait is over, finally get to watch this masterpiece.
Yifei! She's so great in action scene. I feel the power behind her desire to play a role the females could idolize.
It's a movie which I can watch for more than three times! But the only thing is, that I can't see it on the cinema."
2139,"Awesome, feel good remake of a Disney classic. Im a fan of the original and I loved the everything about this remake. Don't listen to the bad reviews and go watch it and decide for yourself. I feel like all the bad reviews are from people so hard up, you wonder why they watch movies in the first place."
2140,"I can appreciate the extent of research and investment Disney has gone for this movie. Including nthe amount of work that went into choosing the lead role. This is definitely a REMAKE, not a shot for shot adaptation of the animation. I originally was upset like everyone else about the removal of Mushu but as I researched why. I discovered, what I loved about Disney, their attention to detail. They were able to remake a movie and hold true to cultural details that the western culture may not understand. So yes, if you are looking for the motion picture shot for shot adaptation of the animation you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for an inspiring representation of the Mulan story for your family 10/10 all day."
2141,It's not like the animated and it's not supposed to be. Disney did a great job telling this story. A lot of work went into it. We were entertained throughout and that's what a movie is supposed to do. Casting was great! Paying the $30 was cheaper than going to the theater and I didn't have to wear a mask.
2142,Don't compare it to other Mulan movies. On its own merits this is a really good movie. Excellent and authentic scenes. Excellent story.
2143,"Great movie, fairly accurate to reality according to Chinese friend"
2144,"This movie is a more accurate adaption of the ""Ballad of Mulan"". Very well done about girl becoming a Warrior."
2145,"I absolutely loved this remake. Was it different than the original? Yes, but that's not a bad thing. I didn't necessarily want to watch other actors trying to redo exactly what I loved about the original. This movie recreates the legend of Mulan and gives you new characters to root for."
2146,"My family truly loved this movie. The cinematography is amazing, the fight scenes incredible, the acting superb! This is the retelling we wanted! An instant classic and one we will watch again and again!!"
2147,This movie tells you that woman can be strong too. Princess is not only about being beautiful and wait for a prince to save you. Girls can be her own prince as well.
2148,"Very beautiful photos.
Great movie for the family even if it is lacking a bit of surprise and excitement. Disney hasn't taken any risk here."
2149,I just finished the movie and remember how much my oldest once loved the cartoon. As a much older father and missing my own child. I think about them and this movie makes me feel joy.In the end we seek to be entertained and have some emotional connection to a story. This story has always resonated with me. I am an old vet and think of my oldest living on their own. Facing life in this world we live in full of sickness and sadness. I hope they are enjoying their life and will always know I love them.
2150,I like Mulan's story very much. It seems to be more in line with modern people's taste
2151,Always a great story line. Visualizing muLan top notch for Disney.
2152,"Sure, there were no songs or cartoony characters like the original version, but that is what made this the most Fantastic live action. Beautiful cinematography, realism, and powerful characters. There has not been one movie that has made my two daughters feel like they can accomplish anything And be powerful without taking away the virtues of femininity as well. Well done Disney!!!!"
2153,Be sure to see Mulan. She will tell you what courage and kindness are.
2154,A movie with heart and good values. Good acting. Loved the songs. This one is a keeper! Can't wait for Mulan 2.
2155,I actually loved this movie better than cartoon version! This was great! Scenery and all was awesome!
2156,"When I saw the heroine crying, I also shed tears. It was a very touching movie"
2157,"The core storyline is the same but thoughtful modifications were made to transform this movie from an animated children's film into a legit action / adventure story. I LOVE the original movie - the music, the humor etc but I appreciate the fact that Disney did not try to replicate the original 1 to 1. They replicated the story. Big fan. This and Aladdin I find incredibly well done. Dumbo, not so much."
2158,"Mulan is simply my heroine. She is brave, kind and sincere, and goes forward in the face of difficulties. I love her so much."
2159,I don't know but i love her.............................................
2160,"This movie accurately tells the legend of Mulan. Disney original did not tell the story correctly. This movie was AMAZING. Mulan cartoon was a favorite when I was growing up, I'm so happy to have the accurate story come to life."
2161,I thought the movie was very good. Watching it with your family is worth the $30 spent. I don't think people realize that this was a story even before Disney did their version. Very enjoyable!
2162,Why would one expect it to be exactly the same? There is no talking pet dragon. There is no singing. But fans of the story should find enough new things in the movie to enjoy.
2163,"Amazing scenery, costuming and action that honors the original story far more than the cartoon ever did. Ignore the haters."
2164,"Obviously we are in a new era with movie watching, but $30 for 2+ people watching it, and owning it, is a great deal.The movie is definitely worth it."
2165,"The Animated Mulan is my all time favorite Disney. This Mulan, is a very different movie. A more serious, action packed movie. If you watch it with an open mind and don't compare it to the animated version, It is a good movie. The actors did a great job, the scenery was beautiful, the story was okay. There isn't any singing or Mushu. To me it was slightly better than average but the original will always be better.
To me it was not worth the $35 for early access. I could have waited until it becomes available to all disney plus subscribers in December."
2166,"If you come expecting a live action version of the classic Disney movie you will gate this. If you love Chinese action movies like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, then you will love this movie.It takes alot of really famous chinese actors and actresses and put them into a great action movie with a Mulan theme."
2167,"The Disney classic hold a place in my heart, but this beautiful film is well acted with a fresh take on the classic. My family and I loved it!"
2168,"To start, if you are expecting a shot by shot remake, you will be disappointed. I think Disney learned their lesson from the terrible Lion King remake.However this is an entirely different story in every way, and if you know that going in, you will like it better.As stated in the title, it reminded me of the horrible Last Airbender live action remake...granted, it wasn't THAT bad. But I felt the story didn't need all the changes it had...especially since the main reason people will watch this is due to nostalgia.To continue, it's long, the characters are very forgettable, and the new additions to the story add nothing.It's an ok movie, but you will be upset if you pay 30 for it, like really upset...Pro's:
The shooting locations were beautiful
Special effects are solidCon's:
Drastically different from the original
The acting isn't great (her love interest has a British sounding accent)
Some cheesey dialogue
The witch character was a total waste, there was potential but it was wasted
Side note, did anyone else think Mulan's father looks just like Xi Xingping? That can't be by accident...Miss this one"
2169,"No, this is not a remake of the 1998 classic. That doesn't make it bad. It is a new movie. Treat it as such. Whining cause it is not a copy of 1998 is quite inane.Look up the ballad of Mulan. You will see they wanted to be truer to the source material.Is it perfect, no. But it was enjoyable. Rate it on it's own merits; not your love of the original. The scenery was fantastic. Acting was mostly good. Audio was great. CGI rough in a couple spots.Overall I enjoyed it."
2170,"If you are looking for the same thing, watch the cartoon movie. If you are looking for a fresh take on a beautiful story of a girl meant to be a warrior it's worth the money.It has the familiarity of the movie we have all grown to love. Although it is not a musical it has themes of the beautiful songs in the background.With beautiful acting and fantastic martial arts choreography it's a new live action favorite."
2171,"You can't go into this thinking your going to be watching your childhood Mulan with the dang dragon. If you can watch it without whining about that, then you'll probably enjoy it. There are some elements from the original Disney take, but very few. Overall, I think it was money well spent."
2172,Poor reviews by others should not deter anyone. This film is inspirational and moving.
2173,"Such a powerful tale and this remake does a wonderful job of bringing this fantasy to life. It is different from the animated movie, but just as good. The new plot elements are a good addition to the ones carried over from the animated version. The stylized sets, costumes, and fight/battle choreography serve to reinforce the actors' enduring performances. Happy that Christina signed on to redo the theme song. We are glad that we decided to get the premier level to be able to see this ultimate girl power picture now."
2174,"Mulan (2020) is a very good movie! It does a great job honoring the Chinese culture and history while correcting some of the inaccuracies of the 'original' (the Huns were mainly in Europe). If you allow it to stand on it's own merits, you'll enjoy it; if you watch it while constantly comparing it to the animated version, you'll likely be disappointed."
